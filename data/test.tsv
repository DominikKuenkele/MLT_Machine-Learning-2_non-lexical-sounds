<silence>	3797	B
	3797	A
how you doing Howard this is a a subject that i'm not real well versed on but	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
okay	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
no okay i'm from the uh i'm from Dallas i'm in Richardson	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
what do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
right	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
right	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
oh really	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
 sure	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
well you are you are well versed on the subject i tell you	3797	A
this is not one of my better ones i guess i guess i notice it the most just uh in driving around Dallas with all the	3797	A
the highway equipment that's working on the on six thirty five and seventy five just with the cars in general that's where i see most of it	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
right	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
oh i don't know i've lived here since seventy four Howard and i don't- i think i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here and i think they'll i think they'll be working on them_1 long after my wife and i are gone	3797	A
 how-	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
right	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
i understand i sure hope so i tell you you know you get out on the uh interstate highways versus i travel quite a bit and traveling from like Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the	3797	A
pollution created by the automobiles in the in the stalled traffic and the busy highways you know you're at your best and i guess when you're out on the interstate heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no	3797	A
build up of cars and	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
yes	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
i tell you what i- i don't think i really have but i'm going that way Tuesday and i'm going to make it a point to	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
sure	3797	A
<silence>	3797	A
oh i know i know going to uh uh i detest going to Houston because it's such a long-	3797	A
	3783	A
okay uh personal computer- i don't have a personal computer i'd like to have one if i had more money i'd have one	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
is it is it hard to find uh compatible pieces for your the one you have at home	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
oh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month they're coming out with something new and so then you're not compatible- oh yeah	3783	A
uh even with like the computer games Nintendo and that kind of stuff i mean they change it every year and the the previous game or the previous program or whatever isn't compatible	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
oh	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
oh okay	3783	A
well that isn't that doesn't sound too bad	3783	A
	3783	A
um not really not in my work um i did try and take a class um i think last was it last spring	3783	A
no actually it was last fall it was at at i took desktop publishing i just wanted to get sort of a a slight feel for it and it was just an introduction course	3783	A
and it was pretty fascinating we we learned how to do how to make a brochure type thing out out- off- off the computer so it was pretty interesting	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
oh so you've yeah	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
now the Lotus is for mostly numbers and graphs and things like that right yeah	3783	A
i'm not real good with computers at all and that's mainly because i don't use them i wish i did i'd be you know	3783	A
more up on it	3783	A
oh my goodness yes	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
have you heard about the phone that uh believe it's AT and T	3783	A
uh is it AT and T that's coming out with the phone with the like on the Jetsons when you could see the you could see the person's face	3783	A
have you seen that yeah	3783	A
yeah yeah i saw that in a in a magazine recently i was really shocked yeah	3783	A
oh i know hopefully you can	3783	A
have control over whether they can see you or not	3783	A
but it looked pretty nice and it's only gonna be two thousand dollars so which is not bad for something new like that so	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
oh	3783	A
my mother does a lot of work on computers and she taps into computers all over the world she works at at she works at TI and uh	3783	A
yeah uh-huh and uh you know she talks to people through the computer from everywhere so i think i think that's really neat too	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
okay uh-huh	3783	A
maybe she knows my mother because_1 my mother used to work in Plano now she works in uh north Dallas i think so	3783	A
 but	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
i visited with some kids in elementary school and nowadays a lot of the schools have computers and the kids are really they're more interested in their schoolwork	3783	A
with the computer you know they can also play games but then they can help them write papers and helps with their math and that kind of thing	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
 and there's always something new even if you know even if you think you know everything about the computer there's always one button	3783	A
that you never quite use and you don't really know what it's for and you know it can be fascinating in that way too especially for a kid that you know is just learning so	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
well hopefully i'll be able to get a computer at some point i don't know when but i don't need one right now	3783	A
but there's gonna come a time i'm sure when everybody's gonna have to have one	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
<silence>	3783	A
	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
uh-huh i've got one	3783	B
 i do have one but it's a kind of an old one that uh they didn't use at work any longer it's not the not the greatest one but uh i use one at work quite a bit all day long in fact	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah because_1 it's a little bit older and uh it's a it's a Wang machine and Wang was you know a leader a while ago but now they're kind of out of it	3783	B
	3783	B
 what's that	3783	B
oh yeah constantly- constantly changing	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
 most of the uh you know WordPerfect and Lotus and those kinds of programs you can subscribe to an update service for about_1 fifty dollars a year i think they'll give you the the next release of their software	3783	B
and but uh	3783	B
yeah do you use one much	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
sure uh-huh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
oh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
yeah oh i'm a CPA and i use it almost all the time for this Lotus program i'll have -well lot of good applications for what i have to do	3783	B
yeah or uh spreadsheets and that type of thing yeah it's	3783	B
 huh	3783	B
 yeah	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
 oh yeah uh-huh when you have a vision with the sound uh-huh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
	3783	B
	3783	B
	3783	B
oh really	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
 well you know they've got these uh all these modems- uh computers have modems in them_1 now where you can call all over the place uh	3783	B
 i can do a fair amount of work from home and tap into our company's main computer system without much trouble	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
uh-huh this is uh how you got signed up for it uh-huh	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah well i have a sister lives in Plano that's my connection with the project	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
but i you know there are i've got a six year old and i think he's	3783	B
he's got quite a bit of interest in uh in playing around with the one we have at home and it's not a it's not a real fun one it's not a color or i don't have much in the way of game software	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah i think it	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah you know adds a dimension that uh probably makes learning a little bit more fun if you get to you know	3783	B
try things a little different than just the standard pencil and paper and crayons	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
um-hum	3783	B
	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
<silence>	3783	B
oh i think that day'll happen i'm hoping and perhaps uh what'll ultimately happen is you won't have to commute as much but you'll be able to do so much from home	3783	B
 that uh you know you won't have to be driving around like-	3783	B
	3727	A
<silence>	3727	A
oh yeah i got three how about_1 yourself	3727	A

<silence>	3727	B
uh oh well yeah we we have done that he in fact he just goes right out here we've got quite a bit of snow now and last week we got a lot	3727	B
<silence>	3727	B
 yeah	3727	B
 you don't like that huh	3727	B
<silence>	3727	B
oh	3727	B
<silence>	3727	B
yeah	3727	B
it is fun	3727	B
<silence>	3727	B
yeah i no i don't like that i really i it makes me nervous yeah	3727	B
<silence>	3727	B
 yeah yeah oh i don't mind it but uh us um the winter gets long	3727	B
you know i get ready if that come about this time of year i'm kind of ready for it to start getting spring and it's too early yet so	3727	B
	3727	B
 yeah we do we do we've had a few early springs though the last few years they haven't been too bad come about March it it gets you know a lot nicer and	3727	B
yeah	3727	B
<silence>	3727	B
	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
okay i was watching the soap opera awards um and and it's it's really making me wanna exercise because_1 every single woman in the audience is	3723	A
about_1 ten pounds	3723	A
so um i started anchoring last up anchoring uh exercising last	3723	A
about_1 last Spring when i- i joined the President's Health Club and i was really motivated and going and i went uh for a little while uh	3723	A
i went pretty regularly but it's hard to go regularly for a long time	3723	A
and where i live in Waco uh they don't have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's so now i don't have a club and i'm i don't have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly	3723	A
or something like that so i'm not exercising at the time at the moment so i wish i could i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that but	3723	A
	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
i think a lot of times if you have someone	3723	A
to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh	3723	A
sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that and that would keep you going	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um-hum um-hum	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
oh yeah	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
that's very true it seems like you walk quicker and you just perky is a good word for it when you when you exercise	3723	A
and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because_1 it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't	3723	A
yeah it doesn't you know hurt you like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that	3723	A
so	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
wow	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
wow	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
uh oh	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
huh i guess my favorite- my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes to go yeah just- with the the stationary bikes to just ride	3723	A
and if you're watching television they usually have television in there or something or if you're listening to a walkman it's pretty it's pretty okay	3723	A
again that's sort of weird because_1 you're you've not going anywhere and it- i- i used to play racquetball and i really loved that because though it to me it had a point	3723	A
	3723	A
oh yeah	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
hum	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls	3723	A
you know like early in the mornings things like that- i never tried that	3723	A
i don't know i've i never really even thought about it really	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
oh	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
oh	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
<silence>	3723	A
um	3723	A
	3723	B
okay	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
oh	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
oh	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
	3723	B
well i understand that i've been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and i thought that'd be the time to get going	3723	B
and uh so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York and so she's not around	3723	B
and i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i don't seem to find time in the day time and of course it's motivation that's keeping me from really looking for that opportunity	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
oh yeah	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah yeah well more than weight course i could use uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that i also notice i just feel better when i exercise	3723	B
and that's something that i'm motivated about now because_1 i do need to get myself feeling better and just in better shape but	3723	B
i um all the same it's connected to my attitude because i'm not feeling as perky and good i'm also it's hard to get my attitude to to get myself out there	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah yeah	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
and you have less- less chance of of hurting yourself	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because_1 she's supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then i had	3723	B
pulled a muscle in my knee actually i hyper extended it or something and uh boy i was suffering for a good three weeks later	3723	B
	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
oh is it	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah yeah	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
uh-huh	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah well i've got a dog now and and of course she needs walking and so that's a little less try you know- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to and	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
oh yeah	3723	B
<silence>	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
that's kind of an idea uh we	3723	B
we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center that's got a walking track that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year	3723	B
but i find it very tedious because i'm watching the clock constantly and it's just nothing else to look at and i actually get more tired doing that than	3723	B
i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good and there i could barely make a couple miles	3723	B
	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yes i have that room i showed you and then since then we painted the bedroom	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah i showed you that one too didn't i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
oh yeah	3756	B
well i've heard now i asked Janice somebody recently about how- how you do that	3756	B
oh uh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that they'd have special rollers	3756	B
that are real soft and furry that you'd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful	3756	B
we use a a two inch brush with uh on a slant	3756	B
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes	3756	B
but	3756	B
	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
well yeah i think i'm going to do it this spring actually	3756	B
there're there're six houses see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials there's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses	3756	B
so i'm thinking i'm gonna change it to something you know the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones i think i'm gonna put something like a brown on it	3756	B
on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something something- where it'll stand out a little	3756	B
what color'd you paint	3756	B
what- yeah	3756	B
there's some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house	3756	B
on the outside-	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
well you got to get one of those ladders	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
oh yeah well a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he's done his house and that's what he i was out there last weekend he's finished everything except the chimney	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah yeah i know our house in New Mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it	3756	B
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff	3756	B
so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid and he came with with his own rafter- uh what do you call those things no those where you built like a rafter thing	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
scaffolds yeah he came and did it that way and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up	3756	B
and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactuses and if he fell he was dead and he knew that so	3756	B
yeah plus he cleaned up my mess	3756	B
	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah that	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
 that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to oh Furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons	3756	B
and anyway he when he checked out they only- and and he was using his Furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something	3756	B
and he had he had the bill- he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint	3756	B
so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something	3756	B
and he saw it- i guess yeah it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
 yeah	3756	B
uh	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
yeah rollers are so messy we never mess with them anymore	3756	B
<silence>	3756	B
well still a paintbrush	3756	B
 okay have you painted something lately	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
 oh yeah another bedroom	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
hm yeah yeah yeah	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
	3756	A
you know where you get around the edge	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
well how do you get the edge though the the straight edge oh i see	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
 huh	3756	A
well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
 oh really	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
oh oh nice	3756	A
	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
oh that'd be nice	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
hm or two tone or two tone	3756	A
you know	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh well the white but i have a problem i can't get up high and we can't paint the chimney	3756	A
 well we have one of those ladders we're just not willing to get up that high	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
 well we did too we did it in the fall and it's just it's too high it's really scary but	3756	A
and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that but is other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
the blowers	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
 oh oh oh oh i know what you're talking about um scaffolds that's it	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
it's	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
oh my so that was worth it getting a professional for that	3756	A
 oh i think that's what we might have to do with the chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself	3756	A
it wasn't too bad i mean you save	3756	A
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty	3756	A
you know since it's a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it but in in in that way you know you're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
my word	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
um-hum	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
um-hum	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
oh my word	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
 oh my word so that was really worth it painting his own house	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
	3756	A
but uh i think i'll probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little	3756	A
 oh i know but it's that it's the textured wall	3756	A
<silence>	3756	A
he can still	3756	A
	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
my voting experience	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
i- i well personally i've been very diligent until recent years	3788	B
when i felt my vote was absolutely	3788	B
kind of washed down the drain	3788	B
for the issues that you know that i felt really strong for um	3788	B
i think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
you really do have to study to get yourself um up to par with	3788	B
what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research and and people today are very busy	3788	B
and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh involved- i know i'm heavenly involved in other things	3788	B
and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i don't have the time to devote to that	3788	B
and uh	3788	B
you hopefully -will find	3788	B
that	3788	B
you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard and unfortunately they are not	3788	B
and uh it's really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in i believe um	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
so i kind of just have taken a back step away and uh	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there	3788	B
take it it- because it is a task that is	3788	B
to me kind of overwhelming	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
	3788	B
yeah	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
	3788	B
yes	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
well i know that when you're in a smaller community i live in Mesquite and uh	3788	B
when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth	3788	B
they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper i mean they	3788	B
they just give it a small portion of the newspaper but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate	3788	B
and uh and then they have they raise a	3788	B
they raise two sides and uh there's a pro and a con side and uh you can really um	3788	B
feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method	3788	B
uh i feel pretty confident about	3788	B
the way it's put forth now i wouldn't say that about the larger cities though and the and the country uh like the presidential	3788	B
uh i mean they've got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted crooks you know i'm sorry but	3788	B
i don't believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf	3788	B
unless they have the Lord that has done that to them_1	3788	B
and uh without the Lord they can't do it	3788	B
<silence>	3788	B
and i have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet and although i did go down and register and i that's the first time i've ever done that has- what's been your voting experience	3788	A
 well do you feel like uh i mean i	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
uh-huh	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
yes	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
 um-hum	3788	A
	3788	A
 that's really true that's kind of the way that i have felt it i also feel guilty um not	3788	A
knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates course we only have mostly the representation given in the media	3788	A
but um i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known	3788	A
what the issues were and that i because_1 it was a new community	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
it does	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
yeah	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
no	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
no	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
right	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
yes and uh	3788	A
and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and	3788	A
or that and that you don't necessarily your vote doesn't necessarily	3788	A
elect a president	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
right and it's kind of it's awful and and it's hard to feel like one person but i know that it's important	3788	A
and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time and i know that you know people can make a difference but it's hard to	3788	A
to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you're up against	3788	A
and it makes me feel bad that	3788	A
i'm glad i mean i am thankful for the uh nineteenth amendment that it gives women the right to vote and uh	3788	A
i'm glad that that happened	3788	A
and everything and i hope that i will become	3788	A
a better	3788	A
make a better difference in	3788	A
but i haven't done that so far	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
right	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
right right	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
right	3788	A
<silence>	3788	A
yeah and it's not very likely i mean it seems like	3788	A
their-	3788	A
	3781	B
well i suppose we both have credit cards	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
yeah	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
well i do use them um	3781	B
i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i- i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to	3781	B
um	3781	B
but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh	3781	B
they all can build up	3781	B
uh i think they're handy i just get	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
uh i don't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks	3781	B
when you go shopping	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
well do you use credit cards	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
your grandmother huh	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
that's good	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
oh that's that's wonderful	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing it's really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
um yeah	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
well that's good i'm looking right now i'm kind- kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them_1 have gotten higher	3781	B
and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a	3781	B
Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didn't write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think it's eighteen percent or something so	3781	B
think i want to find something that has a lower rate	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
no i haven't	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
is is that the one from Sears	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
okay	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
okay	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
uh-huh oh	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
oh they give you money back for using your credit card	3781	B
oh i didn't know that	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards	3781	B
i worked with- at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take	3781	B
until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so	3781	B
you know now they'll take the Discover but i still don't know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard	3781	B
but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and	3781	B
American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
um-hum yeah i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldn't be able to use them	3781	B
but uh i- i do like my Dillard's i have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop	3781	B
and i do- do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores	3781	B
but	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
well yes no not too much more about credit cards	3781	B
<silence>	3781	B
okay well	3781	B
good talking to you Beth	3781	B
good luck	3781	B
you too bye	3781	B
	3781	B
	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum yeah they seem to be a part of life	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah how do you use them	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
 yeah i use a few i um	3781	A
i watched my grandmother go into debt on them and so i've and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so	3781	A
 basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um	3781	A
i generally and my husband it turns out i've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month	3781	A
 so that we don't pay any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah yeah that's what i feel	3781	A
so	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them_1 in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come but sometimes i forget and	3781	A
so you know a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah have you ever used Discover card	3781	A
yeah i'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off but you know	3781	A
um i think Sears originally put it out but it's um it's pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take Discover	3781	A
and there's no annual service fee which is good you know and then um	3781	A
they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah basically that's it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but i'm not sure	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah i think it's best to keep the number down that you have	3781	A
so	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
well do you have anything else to say or	3781	A
<silence>	3781	A
 okay i don't think i do either so well it was good talking to you	3781	A
okay have a good evening bye-bye	3781	A
	3781	A
	3785	A
school teacher or do you have anything to do with anything in schools or	3785	A
no huh	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
no uh not a lot i've got a couple of friends that work uh as teachers or you know in in different school districts and different things but uh	3785	A
i	3785	A
i have a daughter that's only eighteen months though so we haven't got exposed too much to that but	3785	A
you can sure see where it seems like uh	3785	A
there's a lot of concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education i- i kind of wonder i don't know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or exactly what	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
for them to get	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
sure	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
well they've been cut yeah i just it seems like more and more with uh more families having to resort to you know to two incomes and stuff there's not the time that they spend and so they like you say they expect the the schools to do more of it but hell there's only so many in hours a day	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
oh you know i think that's a good point it's really a good point	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
yeah i uh you know it seems like i remember on school nights you know i was never outside past eight you know maybe nine o'clock at the very latest	3785	A
whether i was in doing homework or not you know i may not have been but yet there was that influence in the home to where i was at least you know getting prepared for the next day or whatever and and you're you know you're right in saying you don't see a lot of that there's out running around and uh doing a lot of different things that	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
TV and Nintendo	3785	A
	3785	A
yeah that's probably true there's a lot more uh	3785	A
yeah that's true i know you know i didn't appreciate i	3785	A
i was you know fortunate to where i could i kind of breezed through high school without too much problem stuff and and didn't really learn how to study that much until i hit college	3785	A
but boy i sure wish now that i had picked that up earlier because_1 you know took me a couple of years in college before i really started getting the grades going and	3785	A
you know it affects your whole life especially when you hit college if you don't you know do as well as you can it can it can follow you for quite a while so	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
to sit and study and i don't know it's it's you know i only have the the one daughter and she's quite young but it makes you a little nervous to	3785	A
know what they have to deal with you know in the future and get prepared for them_1 but	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
do you have any children at all or	3785	A
oh yeah	3785	A
same boat	3785	A
yeah have you uh have you ever considered private schools at all or	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
yeah that's true that's true yeah i- i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh	3785	A
sometimes i wonder if they can get that same thing in a in a private high- school or	3785	A
or not	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
<silence>	3785	A
	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
no i don't no	3785	B
not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
and do you have any children	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
uh-huh	3785	B
 yeah	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
yeah yeah	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
i think it's probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than it's realistic that that the school system can provide	3785	B
and in conjunction a lot of um school districts' funds have been cut because of at least in California that's the case it's probably the case elsewhere too	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
i don't even know if it's just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it it's a matter of	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
well it's kind of a philosophical- philosophical expectation about who's responsible for discipline you know it's	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
it	3785	B
you know you- you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and	3785	B
in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for what's important in terms of values and i think that's probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess	3785	B
i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
maybe TV's a bigger um	3785	B
competitor for their time	3785	B
and when we were kids	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
yeah	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
that's a good point just learning the discipline to to to study	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to speak- speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
 well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um	3785	B
i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco	3785	B
in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um	3785	B
i have to really do the research to find out	3785	B
whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that	3785	B
it's really the the expense is a real issue when you think about	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
<silence>	3785	B
well i don't know how it is in your community i know that um	3785	B
in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually it's not so much in the city actually it's outside more in the east- Oakland or east bay	3785	B
um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that they're getting getting what they want in the public schools so they're almost like public-	3785	B
	3805	A
um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our money's worth	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
yeah did you see Sixty Minutes last night	3805	A
well they did a thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need and uh	3805	A
it's staggering	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
well there are a lot of things that people i think generally	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
well i think it's interesting to look at um	3805	A
where the money goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is	3805	A
that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with	3805	A
and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us	3805	A
i mean and i think it's gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh	3805	A
yeah right that's your- i think that's the only thing that's gonna change it and-	3805	A
our- our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part	3805	A
um i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society uh there's very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off	3805	A
eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyer's uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting	3805	A
 which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special	3805	A
focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve	3805	A
that's not a formula for a better society	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
and the government really plays a role in this	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
i mean well- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful interest-	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
you know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not	3805	A
likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting	3805	A
but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair and when they recognize it's their tax money they're gonna do more about it	3805	A
i think- i'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line	3805	A
an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country they expect	3805	A
 opening it for one hour that they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls	3805	A
and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to put- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government	3805	A
like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then	3805	A
i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look	3805	A
do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
 well that's the good thing about what is happening because_1 i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us more- you know about the problems	3805	A
so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country	3805	A
over a very long period of time	3805	A
um and uh	3805	A
 right	3805	A
yeah	3805	A
<silence>	3805	A
 well you may be right what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a	3805	A
	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
hey listen if i had my way i wouldn't pay my taxes not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things	3805	B
no i did not i was	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
well how does this grab you how does this grab you	3805	B
um this i- i mean i'm i'm a lady but this i heard this on a Christian program and it was	3805	B
uh about the NEA and that's the National Endowment for Arts and they fund	3805	B
they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
and then it just frosts me terribly	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
absolutely	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
i believe that's true yes	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
that's correct	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
heavy involvement from the public	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
yeah heavy involvement from the public	3805	B
yeah	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
absolutely	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
no it is not it's lopsided very much so	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
uh-huh that's right they pull the strings	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
right the yeah	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
i'm sure they will	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
uh-huh	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
yes i understand that but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
oh absolutely	3805	B
right absolutely	3805	B
we only see the tip of the iceberg it's only you know there's so much	3805	B
of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture	3805	B
<silence>	3805	B
	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
uh well on a daily basis uh at lunch time i take a brisk walk for twenty minutes along with a friend at work	3896	A
i am uh paying for a lifetime membership with President's Health Spa	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
well i don't i don't get there very often	3896	A
but um i figure one of these days i will	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum well i have an exercise bike um also that's that's in my my house	3896	A
and it just sits there	3896	A
um-hum not doing me very much good	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
well i i'm from New York and i'm a lot more inspired here in Dallas than i was there because_1 there's a lot more uh open space	3896	A
and you just- you just see a lot more people doing it you know outside- outside all of the time	3896	A
and	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
hm	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
speaking of bicycling i saw a uh a video in uh Blockbusters	3896	A
and it was something for you to sit on your bike and look at while you're you're um you're doing your workout have you	3896	A
yeah it's like you're going through hills or something and it's	3896	A
yeah have you have you watched one of those yeah	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
oh wow	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
yeah	3896	A
yeah um i keep saying i'm going to um rent one and maybe i i'll get to to get on my bike and- and use it	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
well they have those steppers in President's although i haven't i haven't used one of them but i do see people on them and they they're supposed to be really really really a great uh workout	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
yeah i've been on the rowing machine at uh President's and uh i i like that	3896	A
	3896	A
<silence>	3896	A
well well one thing i find that you know once the first time i joined and went in there they they measured me and weighed- and weighed me and all this stuff and wrote my name down on a little card	3896	A
and they show- take you around they show you all the equipment and then you never see- hear from them again you know you you're really basically on your own	3896	A
you know they tell you how many of these to do and many of those to do and then you- you- you know they never like call you back and say well it's time for us to see how	3896	A
	3896	B
well what kind of exercise do you do	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
okay	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
	3896	B
you're paying for it but not utilizing it too much	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
um	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
yeah i'm not i'm not currently uh enrolled in a athletic club or anything uh	3896	B
i try to get out and do a little bit of running during the week uh when the weather is good or it's a little tough in the winter when it gets dark so early but	3896	B
um uh i try to get out as much as i can	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
	3896	B
sits there and collects dust huh	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
uh i- i lived in Colorado quite a few years and i was more inspired to workout there just because the weather was	3896	B
uh clear more of the time and and i like to stay in better shape to go out and do a lot of skiing and things like that and since i moved to Dallas i guess i haven't been as inspired to get out and do as much	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
yeah i- i find it kind of uh kind of a chore i guess to go uh uh on a regular	3896	B
schedule to work working out inside i'd much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
uh-huh	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
oh is it like a scenery or something	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
	3896	B
no i haven't but i- i have seen some things uh	3896	B
uh advertised in videos like that and i've heard some athletic clubs have	3896	B
uh have machines with a screen like that and that actually the computer	3896	B
uh when- when it shows you're going up a hill it actually makes the bike peddle harder and things like that	3896	B
and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or something like that	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
yeah we bought a uh stepper and uh in the winter time i've tired to use that uh a couple of times a week just because it's so hard to get outside and	3896	B
and and do much in the way of either you- like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it	3896	B
not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there- there is a Y very close i guess i could do that	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
there they they do work you pretty good and	3896	B
um other things i've used that give you pretty good workout uh the rowing machines aren't to bad and	3896	B
one of the best ones although good- for people who aren't used to cross country skiing those Nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people don't like it because they don't feel like they they have good	3896	B
balance i guess it's it it's better if you know how to cross country ski before you use those	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
what's the i've i've heard some other people uh not too happy with President's uh they join and then it seems like that they don't have a lot of good things to say about it	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
oh the-	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
<silence>	3896	B
	3897	B
well um i had planned a very successful cousins reunion i have a lot of cousins and i did that several years ago in fact it was so well received they've been really having a fit for me to do it again	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
good	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
oh how neat	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
uh-huh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over several-	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum well that's kind of nice to be able to do that to- for both occasions my my uh family	3897	B
um my father's family uh he had five or six oh i let see six brothers and sisters	3897	B
and uh when my grandmother died we found that we were not getting together except um just when somebody died	3897	B
it was only funerals and so it was kind of sad so about i guess it was about two or three years ago i planed this cousins reunion and how i my my cousins even though we're all	3897	B
fairly close there's only two or three of them that's out of town and out of state	3897	B
 uh i we didn't keep in close contact and there were sometimes well let's see one one family had five and one family had four children and the rest of us were you know like two and three	3897	B
and uh	3897	B
so i just sent to the oldest child in each you know uh in each family	3897	B
uh my oldest cousin in every family to uh to send me their	3897	B
brother's and sister's names and addresses and their names of their spouses	3897	B
and i got good- pretty good response from that had to do a little phone work and then i just sent out a real neat little memo to everybody	3897	B
and one of the cousins helped cook the meat- the meat and everybody brought a dish	3897	B
and uh i it just worked out really really well	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
oh my word	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
well i- i can imagine it's hard to get that many people together	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
oh shoot well how often do you all do you have- try to have like reunion	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum oh well that's that would be fun uh-huh	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
uh-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
well i don't know about you but neighborhoods just aren't like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that that is really neat	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
oh sure and and to find out what happened to everybody right um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
well one of the fun things i did was when i sent out my invitations i mean they weren't like invitations i just did it on a	3897	B
on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my cousins um when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage	3897	B
on on that you know and just just printed it on uh a real good copy machine uh you know you they weren't really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it	3897	B
and everybody got a big kick out of that because_1 there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had had	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
oh that would be fun- uh was that it wasn't- that wasn't a genealogy book or	3897	B
it was it was different than that	3897	B
<silence>	3897	B
 go ahead Vickie	3897	A
	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
um-hum	3897	A
i've never actually got to plan one but i've came to several back here in Tennessee that uh were planned long distance with people you know because_1 my immediate family is like five states	3897	A
and they've all turned out pretty good and this time we're here for my mother's eighty fifth birthday	3897	A
and we had a big dinner today about thirty people and	3897	A
uh well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephew's one of my nephew's is getting married so	3897	A
a lot of people came from well to Florida Virginia and Texas and Tennessee here for that for both occasions	3897	A
so it's been	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
i i'm actually one of sixteen kids so and only nine of those kids belong to my mother	3897	A
and they were all here in Tennessee today the first time we have all been together for a snap shot in	3897	A
well forever it's been in my memory yeah	3897	A
the last time we had a legitimate family reunion one of the sisters couldn't make it so	3897	A
everybody had pictures of everybody together but her	3897	A
	3897	A
so today we	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
well	3897	A
it's kind of like your family sometimes it's just funerals and and and special occasions but the last family reunion was in eighty five and i'd like to see another one get going	3897	A
i was going to you know now that the subjects been brought up uh about five years ago it was- actually i didn't get to attend this but i was so wanting to but several of my sisters had got together with some other people in the neighborhood we grew up in	3897	A
and we had a community park and of course we all rode the same buses and stuff and they had a block- or like a community reunion and	3897	A
i didn't get to attend because i was in the process of moving to Texas over that same weekend and uh but they said you know it was a blast and they sent me pictures	3897	A
it was you know people we grew up with and uh people came from all over the place to get back for that one	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but uh i'd like to see i'd still like to see them_1 yeah	3897	A
well at the time you know all i could do was tell them hey well Sam's moving from New Mexico to Texas and this that and so- the other so	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
um-hum	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
hum a few years ago my wife's family and they're off in a little town in Missouri and uh	3897	A
they planned it for several years and actually had a book made of peoples stories and where people went and photographs that went back about two hundred years and uh and of course	3897	A
<silence>	3897	A
it was no it each each family that lived in	3897	A
	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
well that's a a good question um	3874	B
i read the newspaper obviously and and watch TV	3874	B
and uh	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
uh we have one here at at at six o'clock in the evening to seven where we have local news followed by uh	3874	B
and i- i- i can't name the CBS i guess it is	3874	B
who is- who is the gentleman that uh	3874	B
MC's that program	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
yeah i think in fact- i think it's Dan Rather yeah i- i- i have uh been- just retired recently so i have had very little time really to watch	3874	B
TV and uh to get the news so all of my time that was available was between about six and seven uh obviously i scan the newspaper	3874	B
and um i think	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
no	3874	B
i get mine at the end of the day	3874	B
	3874	B
i at least i used to and now i'm beginning to read it about noon since i just retired i- i retired from Penn State and i just uh now i have some morning time available	3874	B
and it used to be that we got our newspapers in the evening which i liked because that's when i could read it and i felt like it was fresh	3874	B
and for the last two or three years our newspapers have been coming early in the morning and it's been six or seven o'clock at night before i got to read it	3874	B
and i had already heard all kinds of conflicting things during the day before i read a newspaper	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
 yes	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
uh	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
uh-huh	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
well that's my normal time six to seven for here	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
um-hum	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
how do you feel about the authenticity of these various uh methods of presenting- of representing the news	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
yes i always wonder about the accuracy of their source of information that's what bothers me particularly you know when we're had this business of the of the war over there in Europe i mean i always wondered about	3874	B
it that they based what they said on whoever told them well whoever told them_1 might not necessarily have the accurate news and know of the overall- know the overall	3874	B
story	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
 yeah	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
um-hum	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
well then the the only thing that you can be sure of the uh has gotten it straight from the horse so to speak is did you hear uh President Bush's speech the other night	3874	B
well at least we know what he said	3874	B
and we we don't have to to uh read in the newspaper what they think he said or what the Democrats think he said we know what we heard him say	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
yes	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
that's when you find out of all the disturbances that are in the background that know one else knows about that's the problem when you're in a politics	3874	B
there's always somebody working behind your back and- who just doesn't want you to get your way simply- because_1 you're on the other team well that's ridiculous really	3874	B
yeah yep	3874	B
<silence>	3874	B
 how do you get most of your news	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
what are your favorites on TV for for news programs	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
 uh that's terrible i know i should know these but is Dan Rather	3874	A
C B S	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
are you one of those people that tends to like to go through the paper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something or do you tend to like to read at the end of the day	3874	A
yes that's the way i am	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
oh that's nice	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
right	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
yeah	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
oh really	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
	3874	A
sometimes it feels as though what i'm reading in the newspaper is the old news it's as if i heard it just the day before on the television and i wonder where they get a lot of their stories but i think that	3874	A
the one that i'm i feel like i get the most information from is is uh McNeil Lehrer and sometimes it's on in the afternoon if i'm if i'm home but i work most the time so um	3874	A
the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal because	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
yes you're preparing dinner but you still have an opportunity to to look at it occasionally we have a little two year old so there's not a lot of time to for me i feel to spend as much time with the	3874	A
updates as i'd like to i think i probably get more of it from Lee because he works out of our home and um	3874	A
	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
it it seems to me that McNeil Lehrer spends more time with each issue therefore i can count on it being more accurate uh because they've really spent more	3874	A
development of the story as well as research and	3874	A
and i get a better picture of what it is that i'm hearing about i- i wonder about the authenticity of the others um i- i have a feeling they get a lot from UPI and AP and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and	3874	A
just give little spots to it and	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
right and certainly in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press from some activities because they didn't want to have a lot of political fall out i think but there was probably	3874	A
some repetition of of stories that didn't have complete um confirmation i wondered that about the whole Clinton thing recently um you know something coming out in the tabloids and being picked up by a major media	3874	A
uh one of the accusations obviously is that they didn't go down there and research it and and get enough information i don't have a preference or an opinion really on that story one way or the other but it's uh	3874	A
	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
yes	3874	A
	3874	A
this is true	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
uh-huh but it is always interesting to hear the follow ups you know on any kind of major presentation you always get the analysis	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
<silence>	3874	A
well they all have their perceptions too you know they may have heard the exact same thing and that's just their	3874	A
	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
i have um we own a house that we rent out	3842	B
and i- i rent the house that i live in	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
and the house that i'm renting- the house that i live in had the landlord provides the yard work	3842	B
the house that we own i provide the yard work	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
i know well the the one that i live in is not nearly so nice as the one i rent out though-	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
i wanna preserve the the the- value of the house by making sure the yard is taken care of	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
so i- i go over to my other house and mow the yard and plant bulbs and flowers and	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
i adore it	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
yeah	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
 did you mow the yard when you were younger or do stuff like that	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
ooh	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
do you still do yard work	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
 oh	3842	B
 do you do anything anything like um uh house plants or	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
oh gosh	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
ooh what is it	3842	B
	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
	3842	B
oh	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
i killed an aloe vera	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
oh yeah um corn plants those are called corn plants or- or Dracaena or they're some kind of Dracaena but common name's corn plants i think-	3842	B
oh	3842	B
oh huh	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
huh that's i don't i know i have one of those that's not doing very well but	3842	B
i think i know what you're talking about	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
you- you haven't killed it	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
<silence>	3842	B
<silence>	3842	A
uh what kind of lawn and garden work do you wind up doing	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
um-hum	3842	A
okay	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
okay	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
okay	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
okay this sounds kind of like slightly jumbled situation there	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
uh that good income huh	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
yes	3842	A
okay	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
yes	3842	A
do- do you enjoy gardening	3842	A
yeah it's real relaxation	3842	A
uh my father ran a service station for thirty nine years and his	3842	A
i mean when- when i was a kid i didn't realize how true it was but he always said that that was the best way he knew of to wind- to wind down after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden	3842	A
and especially you know just hoeing just- hoeing up the weeds it was therapy to him	3842	A
and i guess it still is but uh	3842	A
and i didn't seem that way when i was like ten years old but	3842	A
oh yeah yeah um we had about a quarter of an acre worth of lawn between our my- my parents' house and our next door neighbor	3842	A
they were a rather elderly couple so we cut their lawn for them_1	3842	A
but uh	3842	A
there's about a half acre worth of garden we kept	3842	A
so when the kids and	3842	A
dad we	3842	A
	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
well uh since i moved away from home i got to live in a place that had a yard	3842	A
so i not really	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
yes we've actually gotten to the point where uh for a while i couldn't seem to keep anything alive	3842	A
i couldn't even grow weeds in the house	3842	A
but about three years ago my wife and i somehow another seemed to have turned into green thumbs we got we pinched off a uh a couple- couple of a twigs from a house plant of her mother's	3842	A
and wrapped them in a wet paper towel and brought them_1 home with us	3842	A
and put them_1 in a jar of Miracle Grow and water and these this thing took off and we planted them_1 and now it's a plant uh plant we pinched them off of was kind of full and leafy but it was only about	3842	A
eight inches high off the top of the pot this thing's about five feet tall now	3842	A
and- i don't know	3842	A
 it- it's this you know some little broad leaf something or other we	3842	A
but uh it's it's got real thick thick stalks to it that like i say it's the couple of those stalks over five feet tall	3842	A
but uh they're just growing like mad once we got that thing going we wound up with about five or six other house plants that are all doing real well some people gave us some aloe vera and it	3842	A
it's doing well i mean it's had it's bad spots but	3842	A
uh it's had its rough times but yeah but it's it's doing real well now um	3842	A
i brought her a uh a couple of-	3842	A
i don't even know what they're called looks like overly large lawn grass but it just a broad leaf type of lawn net kind of like a a leaf on a stalk of corn but uh greener it's	3842	A
short house plant pardon	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
yeah well it doesn't get a stalk the the leaves all come out of the center it doesn't really resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself it is- about_1 like the shape of a leaf a leaf on a stalk of corn but it's not on a	3842	A
stalk it's just all out of the center	3842	A
<silence>	3842	A
yeah and uh it doesn't seem to flower any and let's see we've got a little somebody gave us a Fichus and uh	3842	A
uh when we first got it no well we came close we got really close	3842	A
um when we first got it she kept moving it back and forth from our own front porch to the uh inside and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside	3842	A
and it had shed almost all its leaves it looked really scraggly and rough and when somebody finally told us the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them_1	3842	A
	3826	B
so the question is how do we keep up with current events	3826	B
as a matter of fact as you called i was uh taking a look at uh the San Francisco Examiner	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
uh i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour fairly regularly and uh the network news less often	3826	B
and will watch some of the talking heads programs on PBS	3826	B
uh and that's pretty much about it we don't get Time or Newsweek um	3826	B
and uh as a matter of fact i don't get any of those sort of of magazines anymore	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
yeah do you watch the network news	3826	B
yeah out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock uh well they're moving the prime time schedule up from	3826	B
uh eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten	3826	B
and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here	3826	B
um will move up on all three of the local network affiliates	3826	B
i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie JFK have you have you seen-	3826	B
yeah it's really interesting to listen to how different people uh approach different topics um	3826	B
it the i didn't realize this but uh Dan Rather at CBS was the first person to view this Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination	3826	B
and he had viewed it the day after and uh got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one	3826	B
and uh it's really interesting- and he Rather wrote- later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece of uh uh evidence backwards that he'd argued like a lot of other people that Kennedy had lurched forward	3826	B
after the shot and he'd in fact been uh forced backward which lends credence to the two	3826	B
uh to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie	3826	B
i haven't either	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
it is uh you know i uh are you one of those people who believes that it was uh not a lone gunman that that we just never really got the full story	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
yeah i- i haven't seen the movie either but i- i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy	3826	B
and uh	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
well that's what Oliver Stone's seeking to do and i- i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes	3826	B
uh really important news comes to people through movies	3826	B
through television	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
yeah and and i think that's really interesting i know that um uh my wife and i were talking about	3826	B
how uh much uh attitudes toward women uh and and the relationships between men and women husband's and wives uh are changing and i think people get more of that information	3826	B
through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper	3826	B
uh that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and and uh i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um	3826	B
it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services	3826	B
so much uh so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
um i came up here i was uh working for uh a unit of AT&T and was promoted i came out to California to go to graduate school and and was hired out of the PhD program um in southern California	3826	B
and went to work for a unit of AT&T and they promoted me and moved me up here and we liked it my my wife is from San Diego	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
live uh right out by the park right uh right off uh Lindley Meadow in Golden Gate Park	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
yeah what took you to Texas	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
oh yeah	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
uh-huh and you grew up in Walnut Creek yeah how long have you been in Texas	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
that's do you like it	3826	B
that's a i- i hear a lot of good things about Texas	3826	B
it's big it's probably more affordable housing it's	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
<silence>	3826	B
i well i the the we live yeah living here it's just it's	3826	B
	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
current events you take a newspaper	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
is that right is that how you usually keep up on the news	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
uh-huh	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
yeah	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
yeah i don't either it's mostly by the news but mine is mostly- mostly- mostly just like the six o'clock news or eleven o'clock is usually about the time i'm ready to look at TV	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
uh yeah some	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
oh	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
huh	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
yeah that's had a lot of publicity hasn't it	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
uh-huh	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
right	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
i haven't seen it	3826	A
but it sure will be interesting to see how see it once i do figure out what all the controversy's about	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
yeah i don't think we got the full story but i don't you know i haven't seen the movie so i don't really have an opinion about what he had to say yet	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
right	3826	A
but who was involved that's i guess that's the story to tell huh	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
yeah just like this years later maybe	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
that's probably exactly right	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
right	3826	A
<silence>	3826	A
that's right	3826	A
that's right so what brought you to San Francisco have you-	3826	A

	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
uh	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
well the uh what i really i don't like is the call- the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things	3845	B
you know people trying to solicit for different you know organizations	3845	B
now that's what i really	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B

<silence>	3845	B
yeah	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
well yeah i mean yeah yeah and and you- know- of course they call you know before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd i the you know i the the minute i get home the phone would be ringing uh	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
oh it's great i mean	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
	3845	B
uh you know uh end this call press three and i assumed i was you know was from the switchboard you know yeah it is because_1 one day i listened you know and it was	3845	B
you know but um i- i just got totally disgusted and and you know people asking for for money for everything you know i mean it-	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
exactly and you know the policeman's association and-	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
oh i used to do that yeah i used to do that i'd say- or three kids to the movies or something	3845	B
<silence>	3845	B
	3845	A
well what do you think about your everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
oh	3845	A
right	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
yeah i think that that's the only thing i wrote down also because that's just a	3845	A
it's terrible today i mean my wife and i it seems like i get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and and it rings up until ten and- eleven o'clock sometimes	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
yes i know -that's true	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
	3845	A
yeah that's true	3845	A
but you know people	3845	A
it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls	3845	A
i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day and and a lot a days i'll get to and three calls from	3845	A
from people selling insurance you know to the small business man	3845	A
and uh you know i think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your according to what i've understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in New York and uh	3845	A
California always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever	3845	A
and now i getting the same calls at at the house	3845	A
and they get your- and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet and uh credit card companies they sell your name	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
i know	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
yes	3845	A
American Express does that by the way	3845	A
yeah i understand they sell their- you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them_1	3845	A
and uh that is an invasion of privacy you're right	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
i know that's true	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
exactly magazine companies uh from from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money	3845	A
but it's uh you know i guess it uh you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an American Express card so your name is valuable to i guess X amount of solicitors calling	3845	A
so i don't know	3845	A
where- where do you where you from	3845	A
oh okay well so yeah we live in the Dallas area Richardson	3845	A
 okay laughter	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
did you	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
yeah i've got i talked to people in Utah people in New York and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and i'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
i'll be darn where you from not from Texas	3845	A
New Jersey right yeah yeah my wife's from New Jersey	3845	A
yeah from uh Saddle River	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
she	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
okay	3845	A
well that's nice too	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
really yes- my wife's been away since- we've been married twenty five years so she she's been away for quite a while	3845	A
her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas and her mother was from New York so they just	3845	A
they officed over there in New Jersey	3845	A
so but anyway yeah this topic is it's a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that's the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
i know	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
that's a that's a good suggestion i might start using the answering machine more because you know it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
right	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
sure	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
 you yeah you're probably right	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
i understand i mean i it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriff's association and and	3845	A
i know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival- carnival or circus and then	3845	A
<silence>	3845	A
right there's always a different- and and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night	3845	A
	3865	B
yes i have one Chihuahua that's fourteen years old	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
do you	3865	B
oh uh-huh	3865	B
there's been a time when we had as many as like four pets when our children were growing up and everything you know but they died off one by one and that's it	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
yeah yeah cause they're just they are kind of like a baby you know they're they	3865	B
you have to carry them_1 around you know they can't do a lot	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
	3865	B
right uh but well our cat died two years ago and she was eighteen years old well i am telling you this because you have cats	3865	B
so she lived a long time	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
well kind of both uh	3865	B
she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a little door you know where she could come in	3865	B
but then as she got real old then she went out less and less and then not at all you know the last year or so	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
so uh	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
now what do your cats look like	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
uh-huh	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
oh you have to have his skin i mean his hair-	3865	B
oh	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
oh	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
 he doesn't	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
oh my goodness	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
oh yeah i don't think i have ever seen a cat sheared like that	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
oh my i bet	3865	B
 do your cats get along well	3865	B
	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
oh now we do a lot uh we our daughters are like in their late twenties and one of them has a Shelty	3865	B
and uh	3865	B
so any time she is traveling or she is working a lot or whatever all kinds of reasons	3865	B
her dog is here a lot you know	3865	B
and uh its a very pretty dog you know looks like a little miniature collie	3865	B

but uh it is a real pretty little dog but uh i don't know if all of them are that way or not its a real shy dog it really only likes likes my daughter and us you know	3865	B
and uh	3865	B
otherwise it'll go hide	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
yeah well i- yeah now cats it is more usual i think to do that i don't think i have ever known a dog that would this i mean she is so shy that my daughter's roommate	3865	B
	3865	B
	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
yeah yeah they don't uh	3865	B
uh i mean they they know each other and and all that but they i mean they don't play or anything because my my Chihuahua is older she doesn't care any thing about playing and we have promised her that	3865	B
she- we are not going to get any more pets until she is gone she is going to be an only child	3865	B
because every when we got her she was like one of four pets	3865	B
uh	3865	B
right right we had a	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
yeah well of course this one's	3865	B
<silence>	3865	B
oh yeah trying to make a long story short we stopped at a service station several months ago and then when we got home i said well you get the dog i will get the baby i had the grandchild in the backseat	3865	B
no dog	3865	B
the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and uh we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and	3865	B
and it took us three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and pictures- with pictures of the dog	3865	B
well somebody looked at the picture on the poster well not poster i made you know xerox copies looked at the picture and said i saw that dog Sunday and he directed me to who	3865	B

oh i have one that is a calico and she is not very friendly	3865	A
and i have one that is uh uh yellow and white long hair	3865	A
and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it's the funniest looking thing you have ever seen	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
his fur shaved because he he mats up so bad	3865	A
and he doesn't lick his coat	3865	A
and he gets great big old knots all over him and then when you go pick him up he looks so funny	3865	A
it looks like a cat going out for aerobics	3865	A
cause they don't shave you know their legs	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
no it's real strange	3865	A
	3865	A
they call it a lion cut they shave it all the way to the collar	3865	A
it's really funny he's real friendly he acts like a dog	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
 yeah	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
no they don't like each other at all	3865	A
	3865	A
they really don't that is really strange	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
right	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
oh really	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
oh neat	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
yeah well that is what my cats do when company comes they hide	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
shy	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
oh my word that is shy	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
wow	3865	A
does your dog and your daughter's dog get along	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
get in each other's way	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
and now this is her time	3865	A
well those are so cute i just adore them_1	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
do you carry it a lot with you in the car and stuff	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
oh my word	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
how'd you find it	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
<silence>	3865	A
	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
uh mainly the fact that they let women in law now	3819	B
i think that had a lot to do with the way people thought about women	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
not just lawyers but police officers and judges and	3819	B
the whole legal profession in general	3819	B
because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male	3819	B
and now there's women in it and i think that affected a lot of things	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
oh i can i can definitely agree with that i'm i'm in a field that most people say is strictly male	3819	B
yeah mechanics	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
oh yeah very painful especially when you have certain women that take very dim views on mothers that actually work	3819	B
i'm a mother of two and i still hold down a job and a lot of people say well you're not home with your kids all the time your kids are gonna turn out bad i don't think so	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
some men but you'd believe you wouldn't believe how many women are against it	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
yeah	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
um-hum	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
oh yeah and i think it's one of the biggest steps	3819	B
we or any other country in general could take	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
yeah	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
yep	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
yeah that's for sure and you know a lot of people think that the men are the ones that are fighting this	3819	B
but you'd be surprised the majority of the people that are against women going into the work force doing you know even jobs you know on an even keel with men	3819	B
a good percentage of them_1 are the women that are fighting it and most people say well men try and keep women locked up that's not necessarily true	3819	B
i mean the women have these ideas that they got to be the little home makers and they have to stay at home or they're not doing good you know a good job	3819	B
and that's not necessarily so but everybody's blaming it on the guys saying well the guys don't let the women out	3819	B
that's not necessarily so it's just the women have to realize they can do both	3819	B
	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
yep and the fact that women are actually getting out and working and also keeping the home together	3819	B
<silence>	3819	B
	3819	A
what do you think have been the most significant changes	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
so lawyers	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
well i think that's a big contributor i think women have uh really	3819	A
um begun to penetrate a lot of fields that were dominated by men for centuries	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
oh yeah	3819	A
uh-huh well i think um	3819	A
one of the best things that has happened in the twentieth century has been the uh penetration of a lot of these fields by women and i think	3819	A
it's gonna continue uh and even though it's pretty difficult now for	3819	A
some men and and a lot of women i think uh	3819	A
it's gonna bring very good things and uh we're going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but it's a painful transition	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
well i think there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and i guess that's the big thing	3819	A
you know as people change their attitudes that's gonna make the biggest difference women uh participating as equal partners	3819	A
in our society is one of the best things that will ever happen and history will record that but a lot of people really don't like that idea and uh	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
no i i'm not look at what happened with the Anita Hill testimony before the Senate subcommittee and	3819	A
uh now i'm not surprised by that at all we have uh we have a two year old my wife uh works out of the home um and uh	3819	A
uh i think just looking at how uh her uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before	3819	A
so it's it it's really changing attitudes and um the economic necessity and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big difference i think	3819	A
um it's a painful transition but a really important one and	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
yeah i think it's a big step for humankind and i think uh it's it's real progress but there are a lot of people with attitudes that have to change and i- i guess in answering the question that's what i would say i'd say	3819	A
that overall it's just the attitude of men and women toward equal participation and equal pay and equal political influence and all sorts of other things for women because	3819	A
that's really gonna be better for everybody but a lot of people are threatened by that as is reflected in what goes on	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
yeah i	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
well i think i think both	3819	A
yeah both attitudes have to change and i think uh	3819	A
um it's it's evident- evident to me as i look at all the television shows that now focus on the relationship between men and women uh watching Roseanne last night watching	3819	A
uh the show that preceded it Home Improvements all these television shows which reach the American people are beginning to reflect new attitudes and those	3819	A
<silence>	3819	A
well and not only i mean the the fact of the matter is that women have have carried more than their weight and are still doing that and	3819	A
um i see i think this is part of the problem for men as well as a guy i recognize that it's uh it's men who've suffered from this too because men need to learn- to learn	3819	A
<silence>	3851	B
all right well i as i say i work for a telecommunications company in Plano	3851	B
and uh i really can't complain about the benefits i think they're they're pretty up-to-date and pretty comprehensive uh	3851	B
uh yes they have a thrift plan and profit sharing and uh the the routine things the medical coverage and dental and	3851	B
uh hearing coverage and so forth	3851	B
stock purchase plan and that sort of thing	3851	B
yeah it's uh they're pretty good uh pretty good program pretty good benefits	3851	B
 and uh	3851	B
there's a uh in the thrift plan you can make a choice of a program that you can have your contributions directed to it's not just uh for the purchase of the company's stock it	3851	B
they have three or four different options available for you so it's uh and the vacation	3851	B
	3851	B
what kind of what industry you in	3851	B
oh i see	3851	B
oh okay	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
um	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
um there's a lot of that going on because of the economy and so forth the medical programs have been cut back and	3851	B
we've had to uh i guess up to a year ago the coverage for the employee medical coverage was free but they they charge i think five dollars a month now and they they've	3851	B
no it's you can't complain about that and they've raised deductible or lowered lowered the deductible	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
wait a minute now they raised the deductible they raised the deductible	3851	B
i think it's uh oh it's two hundred per person five hundred for for the family two hundred per covered	3851	B
uh it's it's been better but they have as i said they've raised it here in the last year or two	3851	B
but again i can't i really can't complain about that the vacation plan is pretty good	3851	B
uh there are eleven holidays a year it's it's again it's a competitive program pretty standard	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
yeah well as i said and as you know they're they're cutting back in a lot of areas and uh	3851	B
not just laying off but uh cutting salaries and cutting back in the benefits area as well so	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
oh yeah that's for sure	3851	B
or being laid off but	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
um per	3851	B
for the for the employee	3851	B
yeah that's pretty steep	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
they have a flexible spending account up here where you can contribute a certain amount every month to this flexible spending plan- spending plan and use that money to uh pay your medical uh costs out of	3851	B
and there's there's a lot of interest in that of course if you put in too much money you have to have a pretty good idea as to what your medical expenses are going to be for the year	3851	B
because if you put in too much and you you don't use it all you don't get it back	3851	B
you lose it but uh there's quite a bit of interest in that	3851	B
we have an HMO as well as the uh standard group program	3851	B
do you have an HMO down at your place	3851	B
yeah i don't think there's as much interest in that up here in the HMO as the regular	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
right	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
oh okay	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
well	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
oh it's uh	3851	B
it's Cigna i think we uh	3851	B
Cigna is the uh one that they're using	3851	B
and we have Aetna Aetna underwrites- underwrites not underwrites but it Aetna administers our medical program we're self-insured but Aetna is used to administer the program but Cigna Cigna is the uh HMO they use	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
no it's it's pretty good it's pretty good coverage	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
a what	3851	B
oh	3851	B
well it's uh no they don't they really they don't have- that's one thing they don't have- i guess i could say they really do need to uh	3851	B
uh get or acquire they they think that the 401K could be used as a as a retirement plan i guess that's what some people are doing	3851	B
but there's no retirement plan at all	3851	B
<silence>	3851	B
in fact they're using a company down there in Austin 401K management company to administer the program- it switched to them over the well last month	3851	B
but uh they made a nice presentation so the company decided to go with them but that's one thing they could use as a retirement plan unless you do unless you are committed to using your 401K as a as a retirement program	3851	B
but they don't have any kind of retirement plan	3851	B
oh yes yeah and they do too they match it up to a certain percent you can contribute up to fifteen percent depending on your salary	3851	B
and then uh	3851	B
<silence>	3851	A
go ahead	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
do you have profit sharing	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
well that's nice	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
yeah my company has that too	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh medical	3851	A
i work for a private laboratory	3851	A
yeah we were smaller and it it was it was a lot better the benefits were a lot better and then we bought out another lab and	3851	A
uh they kind of cut the benefits a little bit	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
well that's not bad	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
how	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
oh really lowered it to what	3851	A
yeah	3851	A
to what's your deductible	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
that's that's good	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right that's that's that's better than most though	3851	A
i	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
well that can help a company a lot you know if they if they're in the in the past have been giving a lot of benefits if they cut them just a little bit that'll help	3851	A
and then i think some employees will tolerate that instead of lowering their salaries	3851	A
yeah i would	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
yeah i know they uh they raised our deductible from two hundred to four hundred	3851	A
a person	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
yeah it is but that's something i can live with you know if that's if that's what they want to stop at	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
oh wow	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
no huh-uh we sure don't	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
well they're they're pretty big around here too	3851	A
and you know the larger companies have the HMOs	3851	A
whereas the smaller companies don't	3851	A
i know our our company underwrites our own insurance	3851	A
which in a way i think it it could be a little bad but	3851	A
so far it's working out okay	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
what H HMO are you with	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
oh that's not bad	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
and you have a retirement program and all that	3851	A
a retirement program and all that	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
yeah i've heard of that 401K used as a retirement program before	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
right	3851	A
can you contribute to that 401K	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
<silence>	3851	A
	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
uh	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
uh yes i do uh	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
well unfortunately i have a cholesterol problem and uh i for a long time i did aerobics	3844	B
but a couple of years ago my uh doctor says no don't do aerobics any more ride the stationary bicycle so that that's what i do for thirty minutes a day i average six days a week	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
oh definitely oh definitely uh it's it's boring	3844	B
no no	3844	B
uh and i- i also belong to uh the Texas Club and uh so some days i uh i go over there and i work out with the the Nautilus weights	3844	B
well uh my goal is uh three days a week but usually it boils down to about one day a week	3844	B
uh do you have a regular regimen	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um	3844	B
	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum	3844	B
yeah oh that's wonderful	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
oh yeah that's extremely important	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
yeah there's a a program on in the afternoons on channel two at four o'clock do you have a VCR	3844	B
uh you might record it and play it later now it's just uh	3844	B
oh stretch and tone it's not aerobics	3844	B
uh but it's called body electric and it's a a lady broadcasting from Florida and uh it's for thirty minutes it comes on uh	3844	B
five days a week and uh it it- it's a really good supplement to your bike riding	3844	B
uh it helps with flexibility and uh	3844	B
for- uh for some of the exercises she uses three pound weights	3844	B
but uh she's not a a a great weight person but uh sometimes for the uh upper arms and deltoids and	3844	B
uh back muscles she uses these three pound weights	3844	B
so	3844	B
<silence>	3844	B
uh-huh	3844	B
all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their New Year's resolutions and going out and getting their regular exercise program um do you exercise regularly	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
and tell me about that if you would	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
uh-huh	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
yes	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
	3844	A
wow	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
well that's great that's fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go	3844	A
well good so you're good- you're using it	3844	A
yes because_1 you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
yeah	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
oh	3844	A
okay	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
yes yes	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
well you've got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but it's	3844	A
	3844	A
on all sorts of athletic teams and and regular programs but since i've gotten into a new job and into my uh career	3844	A
and into a young family time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy	3844	A
is that uh i have bicycles and i have two older boys that they like to ride bicycles with me and we ride as a family	3844	A
and you know uh i actually live in Plano but i'm working here in Dallas and they have some excellent bike paths	3844	A
where you can go and ride for miles and miles and days and days and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun	3844	A
and uh one thing that i've been doing also is that	3844	A
mind you it's not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the boys get on their bikes and uh we we	3844	A
they ride along and i jog along and it's a nice time to spend some some time with the boys too so i'm trying to coordinate	3844	A
you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that	3844	A
and uh there there's a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them_1's in soccer and the other one just loves to do it	3844	A
and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that it's very helpful to them also	3844	A
in my oldest boy's soccer league that uh he doesn't seem to run out of breath as much as the other boys do and	3844	A
he can stay in longer	3844	A
and uh	3844	A
and uh so i- i don't have a a regular one but i i really would	3844	A
	3844	A
i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time every day in the morning if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around six or six thirty	3844	A
which means i'd have to get up way early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning to do that and uh i've also tried to set aside time in the afternoon or evening	3844	A
but uh things generally pop up that preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
uh yes i do	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
oh okay	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
well great	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
oh okay	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
well	3844	A
<silence>	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
	3844	A
well that's that's good that's one thing that i'd	3844	A
and the weights i'd kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately	3844	A
	3871	A
well what do you think about recycling	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
i don't see a lot of it here either	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
well i think if they had some place up up up in your area like i know they don't here	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
that's true	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
we we do our cans and stuff but um	3871	A
um you know i don't know if i- if there is someplace close by where you could take everything i know in our neighborhood every so often every few months they'll put in our subdivision they'll put out um	3871	A
like dump trucks so you can get rid of your trash and garbage in your yard and they'll haul it off for you and it is all free if they did something like that and they they'll get a chipper you know like in the spring and in the fall	3871	A
if they did the same thing for recycling i think that would go over real well	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
wow	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
and recycle them	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
were they all over the community	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
right	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
well it couldn't like glass companies buy the glass back from uh the city or something like that	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
right	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
well i'll be	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
well that's pretty neat maybe it'll catch on all over but i haven't really seen it around here hardly at all	3871	A
um i have seen where one um i think trash company will put out you put out a bin but it it was never explained what you put in it	3871	A
you know and do they really you know i haven't seen a special kind of a truck oh in this area now i've seen them_1 uh around Austin uh some they're- they're like three division trucks you know it has three compartments	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
huh	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
right	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
yeah i know i know if they did something like that at work you know if they separated paper where i work they don't even separate the paper	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
<silence>	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
now see they don't even do it where i work for a private laboratory and you know that uh ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it and they they shred all of it	3871	A
you know and i would think you know and i see them_1 carry them_1 out	3871	A
	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
well it's uh certainly would would help things out uh i don't see a terribly lot of it going on uh here	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
i was actually quite surprised i went to uh San Francisco recently uh to Berkeley and and uh	3871	B
they actually have mandatory recycling- well no theirs theirs is not mandatory i'm sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see everybody with you know with with ten bags of things and they and they have a community recycling center uh where	3871	B
rather than than having monetary incentives for the for the people that actually bring stuff into recycling they're just doing it to help out the city and then the city can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off of it um	3871	B
	3871	B
it's just the recycling per se but uh we do very little uh recycle newspapers but other than that	3871	B
kind of a shame	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
um-hum um-hum	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
right	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
yeah i- i- i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling centers that is what i saw in Berkeley was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh	3871	B
in different- in each for different things uh uh you know they even had a specific- specific of course being in wine country they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the wineries would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly	3871	B
yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them_1 uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the aluminum and then for plastics and	3871	B
apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe ten fifteen blocks away from where these friend of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didn't get anything for it but but um	3871	B
you know the thing is that that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the the proceeds from from recycled things	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
yeah that's what i am saying you know they could pay for if they you know if they have to have somebody there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff	3871	B
you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling the glass or or aluminum or whatever	3871	B
and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where people brought books they didn't want put them on the shelf and people- anybody- you just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and	3871	B
it was uh it was quite a quite an operation	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
yeah	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
no no it's	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
yeah	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
oh oh i haven't seen those now i- i- i think i have seen them_1 actually going with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans people put them out separately	3871	B
and they'll they'll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the truck or something but	3871	B
hm yeah i- i- i think that that there's a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling	3871	B
is is a is a little bit wrong you know certainly there's money- you know -it's valuable to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so	3871	B
um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give people money for it	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but there's a lot of computer paper generated so it's you know generally clean white paper	3871	B
and uh	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
oh	3871	B
<silence>	3871	B
	3820	A
um	3820	A
what have been some well i'll start out with some of my my vacations um	3820	A
um when i graduated from high school um my uh band my jazz band and we visited Europe i visited Germany and Austria um Italy	3820	A
uh Switzerland	3820	A
and that was pretty fun i also have visited South America	3820	A
and just this last summer one of my favorite vacations is i went to China	3820	A
	3820	A
so uh i i we my wife and i when we went to China we visited the Great Wall and uh the Forbidden City	3820	A
um	3820	A
 the Forbidden City is uh right there Tiananmen Square is right in front of it and so that's where all the	3820	A
killings occurred not too long- couple years ago and uh also the Forbidden City if you saw what was that one movie that was really famous	3820	A
uh	3820	A
The Last Emperor yeah that was filmed in the Forbidden City so we had to see that when we went anyway	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
oh that sounds fun	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
you'll need to save for that unless you have some friends there you're going to stay with because_1	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
uh-huh yeah they're not too far from here	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
yeah got to go a long ways uh yeah we also don't like to particularly go to tourist spots fact we usually choose to go places where	3820	A
we at least for part of our trip will be visiting someone and uh even when my wife is well	3820	A
and my graduate program that i was in we knew some people who were in Beijing	3820	A
and so uh	3820	A
we were able to stay with them for part of the time in fact they spoke English very well and and helped us around to see some of the places	3820	A
and even when we went to South America uh	3820	A
uh	3820	A
we knew- there were people contacts we had there	3820	A
so	3820	A
uh	3820	A
but most people that i that i uh met you know at the university and so uh	3820	A
it makes a big difference to us we like to go for go on a trip with someone who's from the area because i don't know i've i'm afraid especially if i don't know the language	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
yeah	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
it really makes a difference because i know even when we went to China when we crossed the border we went over to Hong Kong we were so relieved it was so fun to be uh	3820	A
you know it seemed like returning to civilization and where a lot of people spoke English and uh just the general living conditions were were somewhat higher also so it was uh	3820	A
<silence>	3820	A
	3820	B
okay	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
oh boy you're a real world traveler here	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
all right	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
oh yeah um emperor or yeah	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
yeah that was a	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
well my wife and i are right now saving for a trip to to England	3820	B
we would like to stay about a month uh	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
well we do have some friends that we can stay at their place for a while or as long as we want actually but it's you know it's in the southern part so but we want us to go all over the countryside	3820	B
that's our next big vacation we've got planned and just a few days in the London itself is all we're interested in there	3820	B
but mostly to this date uh our vacations have been more like uh anywhere where there's not too many tourists	3820	B
i hate resorts	3820	B
 and things like that i like to go where you can get out by yourself in the mountains done a lot of camping in New Mexico and uh Colorado	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
and one time we even toured Iowa my wife is from Iowa	3820	B
but actually the southern part and uh she'd never really seen a lot of the different northern places and just the lot of the little towns and so we drove around went to the Humana Colonies things like that	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
we really i think she enjoyed it a a lot because she knew more of the history than course than i did of Iowa but	3820	B
it was uh it was interesting	3820	B
here in Texas we live in the middle of Texas it's hard to get out of Texas on a driving trip	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
right we had- had a we went to Mexico City once by ourselves	3820	B
uh mainly because it was just something we could afford to do and	3820	B
we heard it was interesting well we just had a real awful time because we didn't speak Spanish i don't think that would have helped us any anyway	3820	B
it was just a miserable vacation and we decided you know we'll never go anywhere where they don't speak English or somebody that can't help us	3820	B
it was by the end of that week we felt like everybody was out to get us	3820	B
and that sort of thing and we weren't having the fun we thought we would	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
<silence>	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
our last	3820	B
major vacation was uh well we had to go to Iowa to see some relatives because sickness in the family so we took that in for a few days and then we went to a uh	3820	B
to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky	3820	B
and uh it's a it's been rebuilt and we stayed there for three days and it was just kind of neat because we really like Shaker things and we were able to take our dog with us and he stayed with us and	3820	B
it was just the thrill of our life to it was early fall and Kentucky was beautiful that time of the year anyway	3820	B
	3895	A
yes uh we live uh right to the base of the Wasatch Front so uh uh as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
well- well uh sometimes we did most of the time we'd we'd put up tents and we'd go up and stay for a week or	3895	A
uh weekend or go up into uh Yellowstone Park and and camp in the campgrounds up there	3895	A
but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and uh some real good memories how about_1 your experiences on camping uh what have you	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
well that sounds uh	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
oh wow	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
all those fun things huh	3895	A
	3895	A
yes i'll say well we uh when we were up in uh by Yellowstone Park we had uh moose that went through our campground and we had a a bear once that went through uh-huh black bear and then we	3895	A
uh we've seen a lot of rattle snakes uh in our camping trips	3895	A
and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but	3895	A
i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
no no no he we uh didn't bother it and uh everything was fine but uh	3895	A
it's uh camping has really uh been a a great part of our life and now we're we're older all of our kids are gone and we don't uh	3895	A
uh fact last year was the first year i didn't go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and i didn't first time in uh fifty four years that i hadn't gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
but anyway it uh	3895	A
yeah when the grandkids uh get a little bit older then we'll we'll we'll do that again	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
oh uh-huh	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
uh-huh well i would uh it's not like camping in a way but yet it is you're still uh on the	3895	A
right	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
	3895	A
	3895	A
yes uh we got uh where we had a a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we we took up and	3895	A
uh when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did uh pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and uh	3895	A
speaking about_1 tornados up in Yellowstone uh one went through there usually they don't have such things here but	3895	A
it took down pine trees quite a swath and uh we were there right after that happened but uh	3895	A
uh those tornados i guess are uh pretty scary things	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
um-hum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in Yellowstone and it's uh maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but uh and it happened and uh that was	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
oh it is it's it's beautiful we've spent a lot of time up there and that but that's a long ways to pull a trailer	3895	A
	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
	3895	A
yeah	3895	A
<silence>	3895	A
no-	3895	A
	3895	B
well do you go camping Glen	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
by camping	3895	B
you you mean really roughing it	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
oh but that was	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
uh well i've our children were growing up also uh we had a boat and we'd	3895	B
go camping on the long weekends uh Memorial Day Fourth of July Labor Day	3895	B
and uh we went with some good friends and we'd get as many you know involved as we could and	3895	B
so our kids really grew up all through uh you might say junior high and high school camping and uh	3895	B
we've really had a good time doing it um we went to a lake called Lake Tawakoni uh it's just kind of east and south of here in Texas	3895	B
and uh	3895	B
we camped outside one time we had a tornado come through our campgrounds it was kind of interesting we had snakes and armadillos and	3895	B
all the fun things that that make memories	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
a bear oh oh	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
oh	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
uh-huh	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
didn't didn't mind you being there a bit huh	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
oh	3895	B
first time huh well	3895	B
maybe you'll get a chance to go again	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
take them well we kind of gave up camping about three four years ago to and we built a lake house	3895	B
and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
well	3895	B
we're we're still outside but we we we figured we're getting a little too old to rough it as much as we used to	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
i didn't know they did yeah	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
oh	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
i guess most- you know there's probably not any part of the country that doesn't experience them every once in a while	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
i bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we we went up we pulled a trailer out there from Illinois um	3895	B
when uh probably about nineteen seventy four i'm trying- no no no no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to Texas	3895	B
and uh we had like a sixteen foot trailer that uh we pulled behind the car	3895	B
and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i- i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer	3895	B
but we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that	3895	B
<silence>	3895	B
yeah it was and uh we needless to say we haven't- we haven't done it again pulling the trailer is not the our favorite thing to do	3895	B
	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
 yes took one in October and uh drove- uh flew into Los Angeles and drove up the coast	3837	B
to uh through Monterey and San Francisco and over to Lake Tahoe and flew out of Reno	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
uh-huh was really great	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
most of it was because_1 i had uh seen parts of northern California and i'd been to San Francisco but never along the Coast Road	3837	B
it was quite exciting	3837	B
my husband said he didn't know whether he wanted to ever drive it again though	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
have you been	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
um i don't remember that	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
oh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
well we went uh we liked Monterey very much and uh it was just kind of a relaxed pleasant town with a lot of things to see and do and	3837	B
and then uh the Muir Woods on the other side of San Francisco um that's another really bad drive but it's it's worth going to too	3837	B
yes	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
originally from Texas i was raised up in Dalhart	3837	B
so uh anything that doesn't look like flat plains is uh like i told someone once i always thought Dallas was real green	3837	B
because it was the greenest place i'd ever been	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
oh yes live in Dallas	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
where are you from- where do you live	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
okay well you're just a a suburb of Dallas	3837	B
	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
oh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
oh my	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
yes yes	3837	B
well we uh when our children were young we used to go to Estes Park	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
oh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
well how fortunate you were	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
that's that is one beautiful place	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
no	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
um	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
well i've never skied my husband keeps saying we need to go but uh we have never done it yet but uh everyone who does says it's great	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
you have to enjoy the cold snow in your face huh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
 yeah	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
well i think that uh no the dampness course our humidity is sort of medium compared uh well where i was raised is extremely dry	3837	B
but my brother lives in Houston and	3837	B
yeah so we're kind of in-between but uh my mother always said that Dallas was extremely humid to her	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
have you gone on any vacations lately	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
oh yeah	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
have they uh uh we were we were there when it one of the first times it was open they were just building the hotels and	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
i was afraid it had become so commercialized	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
did you go over to the Isle Mujeres	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
um	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
<silence>	3837	B
oh did you get to go out to that reef	3837	B
 well have you taken any vacations that you enjoyed lately	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
okay so you went up like the Coast Highway for a way and then then went inland there	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
is is that uh was that a new area for you to visit	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
	3837	A
it's the	3837	A
it's scenic i guess i i've i've been to a part of that on a trip to San Francisco i i went up just a short ways up the coast to i believe it was Point Raid	3837	A
uh National Seashore i think it was	3837	A
and and i only had about a day so it was just a short drive up from San Francisco and back when i was out out for business	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
uh the the Redwood forest there	3837	A
what part of the country are you from	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
are you currently living in Texas	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
okay i- i'm in Texas too but	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
in Richardson	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
that's right	3837	A
well we uh my family and i moved here about three years ago we lived in Colorado and	3837	A
uh and and that's a good vacation spot too but it was nice living there	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
yes i i didn't live too far from there in fact i bicycled from my house to there a time or two uh	3837	A
uh from Boulder i lived in Boulder Colorado	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
uh i i uh didn't probably take advantage of it as much as i probably would if i moved back you kind of take it for granted when you live there but	3837	A
i did enjoy the skiing and and the and the winter sports that that was available there	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
yeah it's enjoyable if you if you do it more than once or twice so you get past the learning stage so you can start enjoying it it's a little bit frustrating when you're falling a lot but after after you get past that it's a lot of fun	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
well it sometimes can be yeah it it uh	3837	A
you can get some nice days skiing as well though if you're if you're not falling you can stay pretty dry and	3837	A
and uh it it can be pretty nice the dry climate doesn't feel near as cold as as it does here in the winter time to me	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
it's the the other extreme	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
yeah it's i i agree with you it's sort of in between yeah after having lived in Colorado a lot that was a little dryer than was probably comfortable it's it's a bit little too dry and	3837	A
and this is actually a pretty good climate humidity wise in in the Dallas area	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
last uh uh summer we uh we went uh and took the family to uh Cancun in Mexico and uh we really enjoyed that trip	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
well it's pretty built up now	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
yeah it probably was more enjoyable when you went before it was too too built it's it's a real strip hotel strip now out out on that island	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
uh yes we we took a sailboat uh catamaran ride over to Isle Mujeres and they took us around let us shop a little while and then took us to some snorkeling uh	3837	A
spot	3837	A
<silence>	3837	A
<silence>	3866	B
uh i mean i guess i get it most people i get it from uh the paper and the TV and	3866	B
 i guess probably now the TV first paper second and- radio third	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
yeah i was just kind of think of the order you know but uh	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
yeah	3866	B
yeah i think it's uh i don't know i mean	3866	B
it's getting a little bit ridiculous i mean this- this i don't know if you saw it yesterday but uh	3866	B
where i was at had it on CNN and uh they had that press conference with that uh Jennifer Flowers uh Clinton's alleged uh mistress whatever and uh	3866	B
it just got to be so i mean it's ridiculous because_1 you know one of the questions was uh do did uh Clinton use a condom and all that i mean it was uh uh the whole press corp was just laughing	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
right	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
yeah i think i mean he probably did it i mean that's my belief i just think that you know if he did it you know he should have said so on Sixty Minutes and cause i mean American public is pretty forgiving and	3866	B
most times yeah if you do something i mean what else can you say- how can you	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
well now with	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
yeah but i mean the fact is now that he's left himself- the fact that he wouldn't deny it or	3866	B
confirm it was he's just left himself open to further digging from other reporters now you know there's all types of rumors now that	3866	B
Miss uh America Miss Arkansas all the way down to Miss Teen Arkansas well- allegedly had a	3866	B
thing with him i mean it's just going to keep dogging him i- i think he's going to be out of the race in two weeks just because_1 this is going to keep getting the fact that he won't confirm or deny i mean	3866	B
i mean he he's been this has been going on for years though i mean he's always had rumors and stuff and	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
yeah and he	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
no it's just i know it's just i think is just the fact that he uh	3866	B
he just flat out lied to the public that he didn't and it was totally proven wrong and then he challenged you know the press to you know prove it and they did and that's what killed him and Clinton on the other hand if he if he	3866	B
i mean he took a big risk just even going on TV the other night with his wife but i think his wife came off better than he did but	3866	B
in the end i think he's just going to his people now are you know the	3866	B
the fund the campaign you know they're going to wait and see what happens and you know when he keeps more stuff more stuff keeps coming out about him and then	3866	B
i think he'll be out uh you know he'll be out of the race eventually because_1 the money is what uh the only thing that matters in the end and if he doesn't have any money there's not	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
oh yeah she she's a bimbo i mean you know	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
the	3866	B
	3866	B
yeah but	3866	B
i don't know i mean it's just the press is always going to be like that i think and you know i mean- Americans- most i think that most people in America know	3866	B
i mean my people my age you know probably probably really don't care i mean what they i really don't you know care what they do as long as it doesn't	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
but when the press says that you know some it's it's important it's got to be important because i mean they control	3866	B
i mean	3866	B
what's said and everything and	3866	B
yeah i think it's i mean yeah i think it's totally gone overboard and i mean it's issues and everything and the timing of this can-	3866	B
can be more worse for him but he he's clearly the front runner now he's about to get blown out of the water at this time	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
yeah	3866	B
<silence>	3866	B
uh i mean he he he had i mean he had the thing won but now i mean	3866	B
i- i- i just don't think he'll be around i mean this this if you go by past history and you know he's he's dodging the subject now you know he says	3866	B
he clearly stated you know what he had to say on Sixty Minutes he didn't say anything all he said was that the American public knows that i'm mean you know	3866	B
okay what- what do you mean uh Bill and you know i'm not going to confirm or deny anything i mean that's where you	3866	B
<silence>	3866	A
okay	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah same here	3866	A
uh i hardly ever listen to news on the radio i don't even know if they have it anymore	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah what do you think about uh you know the second part of that question was are they doing a good job	3866	A
i'm beginning to think you know especially this week with all that stuff coming out about Clinton uh	3866	A
	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
i- i got a feeling that	3866	A
you know cause from- from what you know i got most of my information from the Larry King show and uh	3866	A
it was like nobody's verified her story at all and it just came from the tabloids and everybody jumped on to it	3866	A
without- and nobody's been able to verify that she's telling the truth all the only thing they know is that she lied about everything else	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
would you go on national television and and uh tell the world that you'd had an affair and you know and your wife and her parents are listening and	3866	A
that would be kind of rough to do	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
i thought we were kind of through with this a few years ago when Gary Hart uh got caught messing around and	3866	A
i thought we would kind of leave private lives out of this the politics but uh	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah we're waiting	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah well when i heard i guess it was yesterday i heard that she'd gotten in excess over a hundred thousand dollars to talk to the this tabloid thing	3866	A
i thought well golly gee she's got to be lying i'd say i slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks you know	3866	A
maybe but	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
well	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
why has the press gone overboard in telling us things and	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
well if if if if somehow he clears himself from this he is all of a sudden jumped out in front	3866	A
because everybody knows his name and and knows where he's from and knows what he looks like and i'm not sure everybody knows all the other people at all	3866	A
that are	3866	A
<silence>	3866	A
 have you ever been on a boat	3868	A
<silence>	3868	A

<silence>	3868	A
oh	3868	A
<silence>	3868	A

oh that's	3868	A
	3868	B
 of course my dad is a big sailor so he likes to sail and he likes to do all that stuff but it's been a long time since he's had a boat	3868	B

<silence>	3868	B
huh	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
nope divorced	3868	B
yep so	3868	B
um yeah we live sort of Fifteenth and Independence	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
oh yeah	3868	B
so are you by Clarks sort of okay	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
oh okay so you're far up there	3868	B

oh are you	3868	B
	3868	B
oh	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
huh	3868	B
and you moved here how long ago	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
oh yeah so you've been moved about the same time we did	3868	B
we moved from North Dakota i was married at the time to a coal miner- well he did you know strip mining kind of thing civil engineer but he um moved down here with that so we came down here-	3868	B
yeah we were in North Dakota with mining too so	3868	B
yeah so that was real different i have four	3868	B
do you	3868	B
Shepherd	3868	B
and Wilson i have uh middle school	3868	B
uh twelve ten nine and three	3868	B
uh-huh a seventh grader fifth grader fourth grader and third through	3868	B
huh	3868	B
so then you have little one	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
oh yeah so just well mine's almost four	3868	B
little girl	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
girl	3868	B
Megan	3868	B
yep Megan Walls	3868	B
so yeah she's i know she's um in band and that kind of stuff	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
yeah so we're probably about the same age and same	3868	B
i know	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
oh really oh to win against that team oh because_1 our Megan's friend is on that team she tried out but she didn't make it so	3868	B
uh Mandy Philip- uh Nichols Amanda Nichols she plays i don't even know what she- you know a number we haven't gone to a game- we were always gonna go to a game and we haven't so	3868	B
she plays the flute	3868	B
yes	3868	B
i sing that's what i started in college on yeah	3868	B
yeah so then i do bells handbells we have handbells at church and so i do that and do that kind of stuff and but i just started i'm uh	3868	B
i don't know- now i'm out of that whole field pretty much except for on the sides kind of thing but	3868	B
	3868	B
so that's what i do	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
never	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
um no	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
we go we've gone to Lake Lavon	3868	B
and um	3868	B
what's else is east Hubbard Lake Ray Hubbard i guess so we've done those and uh camped there and that kind of stuff and we've camped up on um	3868	B
Texoma	3868	B
	3868	B
yeah but i don't know that i've boated there	3868	B
i don't have any friends with boats	3868	B
	3868	B
	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
	3868	B
yeah they're seventh grade girls	3868	B
	3868	B
no well where in California are you from	3868	B
<silence>	3868	B
oh i know where San Francisco sort of area	3868	B
because_1 we have apartments there i do- i do- recruit nurses	3868	B
for a company called Flying Nurses and so we have apartments in Walnut Creek	3868	B
uh i don't know why that rang a bell i know	3868	B
	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
 well i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately uh the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote	3870	B
has uh provided some very good health care and uh much	3870	B
i think inadequate health care uh and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces and i think	3870	B
um it's inevitable it is just a matter of	3870	B
uh time and mistakes and they're both inevitable	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
well it's gonna make it tough for them and it's it's gonna be a difficult transition i don't know uh how it's gonna uh	3870	B
play out in terms of the particulars but i don't think society- society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long	3870	B
our uh	3870	B
physical mental and spiritual health uh it's really very costly uh and uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this my	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
right	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
um-hum yeah	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
yeah there are abuses of they're abusive of privilege	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
right	3870	B
well this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address because i know this is addressed by uh in Canada i- i have a a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in Canada	3870	B
and they made the transition uh and i think that the uh for example duplication of magnetic resonance imagers uh	3870	B
i've i had one myself and uh	3870	B
they're wonderful technologies but cities have uh three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need	3870	B
so i think that what the marketplace doesn't do because of the way the system has worked and it doesn't allocate resources optimally because	3870	B
there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills	3870	B
what's begun to change all of that the people paying the bills uh employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they've seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years	3870	B
so i think the evolution will be interesting uh Hawaii has a system that is apparently working and uh it'll be interesting to see how how	3870	B
uh much more attention we pay to that i do think though that it's inevitable primarily because of the pain uh that people are feeling uh under the circumstances and i believe that	3870	B
it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers	3870	B
uh i don't know i like that idea i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances	3870	B
with the profit incentive work very very well uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
that's that's that's the problem with government uh uh administration of these programs and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with government is gonna have to change in this regard	3870	B
<silence>	3870	B
you know that's really a tough one for me to answer i don't uh uh i would like to see the greatest improvement in management	3870	B
my my field- my field is the cognitive sciences and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done um	3870	B
as a function of the operating systems in place and those operating systems have to change and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems	3870	B
and so a state or federal application uh could work uh it all depends upon the way we structure the environment we may have to do	3870	B
 okay Lee tell me about your ideas on this uh the US government supporting health insurance and so forth	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
well what is this going to do to the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing uh a good job	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
yes	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
well this is what's bothering me Lee another question do you think that there should be some control uh innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously- ridiculously over priced things	3870	A
we realize that for the individual person some things are very important uh matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it	3870	A
but by the same token some of these charges they make for	3870	A
well- well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line there should be some control of that	3870	A
yes and that's what's giving the local um insurance companies hard times that's the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals and you get something done and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
yes we've had several of them_1 my wife and i both have had that recent	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
yes	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
see that that bothers me about the government see uh my	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
do you think that these- that these insurance things should be covered on a state basis or US government basis	3870	A
<silence>	3870	A
	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yeah yeah that's about all i get a chance for between that and um uh Bible study as often as i can that's about the bulk of it	3846	A
not a whole lot of chances otherwise	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
okay um officially a junior right now um	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
well right now i'm taking a a uh my fourth semester of of electronics dealing mostly with uh uh MOSFET and JFET transistors	3846	A
and	3846	A
well okay they they're are gonna uh computer engineering	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
okay i am getting some programming- right right now i'm taking my first semester in in	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yeah yeah well with this- well they classify it as computer engineering technology so i'm getting a fair amount of programming as well as electronics	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
uh it depends on which language they're working with um	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
right now i'm taking C i've got three semesters in Pascal behind me	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
uh that we're working with what what they called standard uh ANSI C	3846	A
um i'm not real sure what the difference is gonna be between C and C	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
um-hum	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
okay well what we're working with is	3846	A
uh i don't remember the author's name	3846	A
	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
used to be i read a good deal of uh science fiction	3846	A
um Asimov um Clark uh	3846	A
there's uh	3846	A
the big one was Asimov his he's his stuff was easiest to find	3846	A
what got me started in the first place was uh my brother-in-law gave me a set the uh um Foundation Trilogy	3846	A
back junior a year and- a when i -was a in- in junior high school he gave it to me	3846	A
oh yeah and he's come up with what three more books	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
uh parts of it i got three parts of it	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yeah yeah wait a minute matter of fact i did read i- i Robot	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
I Robot yeah that's pretty light reading for science fiction those kind of things	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yes he does- well the uh Foundation Trilogy is directly connected to I Robot	3846	A
as a matter of fact his last book Foundation and Earth	3846	A
they made the finally made the connection	3846	A
that uh	3846	A
um leader robot whatever his i don't remember his name now	3846	A
anyway he's still going in the Foundation- at the uh in Foundation and Earth they meet up with him	3846	A
he's on a base on the moon and somehow or another earth has been so utterly polluted with uh uh uh radioactive fallout that it's utterly inhabitable- uninhabitable even though it's been several million years	3846	A
 uh several hundred thousand years anyway	3846	A
so it's- it's utterly uninhabitable	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
oh yeah	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
yeah yeah well i- i got started on student late	3846	A
i was thirty three when i started to college for the first time	3846	A
oh yeah yeah i'd i'd been an auto mechanic for twenty years	3846	A
started about twelve years old for my father but uh decided you know i- i had a pretty good idea that wasn't what i wanted to do any more	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
no didn't go through military um	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
uh	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
uh not familiar with it	3846	A
<silence>	3846	A
	3846	B
i assume most of the books you're reading these days since you're a student have to do with studies	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
the uh	3846	B
what year are you in in computer science	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yeah and so the course work you're doing is what	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
i thought you said computer science was your major	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
oh computer engineering okay that's yeah okay	3846	B
well	3846	B
	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
um-hum	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
right so who's books do you use for programming	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
well tell me what language we're taking these days	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
taking C okay is that just standard C or C plus plus	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yes right um-hum	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
well C plus plus is object oriented and there is uh quite a bit of difference and it quite- often has- you need a book up front to tell you about uh precompiling and that sort of thing and then it normally does a little shuffle up front	3846	B
and then runs on ANSI C or some other similar dialect of C so it does uh some preprocessing to begin with who's book do you use in Pascal	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
so Isaac Asimov for example	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yeah Arthur Clark	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yeah yeah	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
oh yeah that's fantastic	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
oh yeah it's hard to put down those	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
have you ever read Asimov's I Robot	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
	3846	B
i have actually gone back and is- is long enough that was the first science fiction book i ever read was I Robot	3846	B
and it	3846	B
and it was so good i went back and read it again because_1 Asimov knows how to string things together you know	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yeah oh yeah right	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
um-hum um-hum	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
uh	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
i can't remember the name either but	3846	B
uh	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
huh	3846	B
i'll be darned	3846	B
	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
right	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
 oh yeah	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
well while i was working i got enough i read on the job a lot of course just like a student does because_1 you're learning all the time in research so i read-	3846	B
i uh	3846	B
started uh long enough ago that uh vacuum tubes were still in business when i was a young engineer you know so i had to continually upgrade my education and	3846	B
	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yeah so you knew what you wanted to do yeah yeah	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
right	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
<silence>	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
have you been in the military at all	3846	B
oh	3846	B
so probably- so probably the things that i enjoy reading relative to military you would enjoy The Web Web Griffin stuff uh which uh has to do with the military and other right wing things-	3846	B
 well so what do you think they are going to do next year	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
that's right	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
 well which quarterback did you like better	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
i like	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
that's right i like	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
 that's right that's his dream huh	3877	A
yeah i like the way	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
see that's what i was just saying i like the way he handles the press also he's just under control on the field and off	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
 well that's been said plenty of times so	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
speak for themselves	3877	A
yeah so are uh have you been from here all along or did you move from some	3877	A
oh well you're a unique one	3877	A
	3877	A
where did you grow up	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
huh	3877	A
so you've always been a Dallas fan	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
is that right	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
	3877	A
huh did you play yourself	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
 uh-huh	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
 yeah yeah see i came from the San Francisco area so i- i really liked the Oakland Raiders when they were there but then we kind of had to switch loyalties to San Francisco-	3877	A
yeah well as much of Montana as you can see anymore i guess	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
do you think so there's lots of speculation whether he will or not	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah well well they sure went down hill without him	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
Montana	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yep	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah well	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
	3877	A
well there's not much to talk about as far as where we think the teams are heading this year but kind of a silly topic but	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
oh	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
is it	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
so do you follow do you follow SMU football	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yep i would say you follow them pretty closely then	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
huh how fun	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
oh	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
yeah how many kids do you have	3877	A
oh that's gonna be uh a lonely house for you next year	3877	A
i have four but they're little i mean my oldest one is just thirteen so	3877	A
i got a ways to go before they leave me	3877	A
i live in Plano	3877	A
<silence>	3877	A
	3877	B
well i was pretty encouraged by what happened this year and and i think with all those draft choices that i hear that they have uh they ought to be able to pick up a few more players that would help them	3877	B
so i'd i'd have to say i think that the J J Boys have done well	3877	B
oh i- i don't think there is any question that Aikman has to be the the starter because he's got the physical tools i mean that other Beuerlein stepped in and did a wonderful job	3877	B
but i don't think that you can until Troy loses the job on his own merits i think the job has to be his now that he's healthy again now if he doesn't perform then i guess the other guy is waiting to step in the wings	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
but he's- but that guy's got his head screwed on right he's not causing a controversy	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
yeah	3877	B
he said he'd hit the first reporter that says the word quarterback controversy	3877	B
yeah and uh but he doesn't- he doesn't like it he doesn't want that he just wants to go out and do his job when he gets a chance to play he kind of i think wants to let his actions	3877	B
speak for themselves pretty well	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
yeah i'm a Dallas native so i've kind of grown up watching and i even i even went to SMU so i didn't even go away for college so i- i in uh north Dallas in Lake Highlands area	3877	B
Richardson School District	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
yeah i was in the Dallas Cowboy Quarterback Club when they started it back in nineteen sixty i was uh just a little kid then and i use to go to the games and sit in the end zone for a buck of something for this little club thing they had	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
i played in up through about seventh grade	3877	B
and i was not big enough to keep getting killed out there uh	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
now you've got to be a Joe Montana fan a little now huh	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
yeah well he's had a tough year but i think he'll probably come back yeah i	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
you know if his doctor's give him the green light i- i think he will more than likely play again but	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
 yeah to a certain extent you know they sure have got uh they get the best back up in the league but Steve Young but i don't i don't think that you can throw all of San Francisco's	3877	B
lack of getting through this year to to the quarterback i think it's been i think it's been a variety of things they have had several key injuries in certain spots and couple close ball games could have gone one way or another and	3877	B
and uh you know they are still one of the premier uh four or five teams in the league and they're always one to beat	3877	B
so i don't think there is gonna to be any question they are going to be up there again	3877	B
another thing is some of their guys are getting a little older because_1 they have been up there for a while	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
 not since the season is over	3877	B
what i've been watching lately is the uh	3877	B
 potential draft coming up as the players declaring which every time another good player throws his name in that means the draft is gonna be that much stronger and i have been watching the uh	3877	B
 commitments of the high school players to the colleges lately cause that is going on national signing day is coming up next week	3877	B
when they can sign their letter of intent as to what college they want to go to so i've been watching to see if SMU was gonna get a few good players because_1 they've been kind of struggling along since their death penalty thing	3877	B
yeah i have season tickets so i go to all of the games	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
well i was in the band there i uh was part of the spirit of the campus for a long time and uh it just we have a section of band alumni that all sits together called the Diamond M club we just we get the same season tickets every year and so we're uh	3877	B
we're all there and it's it's just kind of fun but i've got a son seventeen years old and he's gonna be going off to Rice in the fall	3877	B
and he wants to play in the the Mob the marching L band down there so i imagine i will be making a few trips to Houston or following them a couple of places to see him play	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
just one	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
how about you have you got any	3877	B
oh wow	3877	B
<silence>	3877	B
yeah what	3877	B
what part of town do you live in	3877	B
oh okay so they go to they go to Plano-	3877	B
	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
uh i crochet uh in in fact uh that's what i was doing when the phone rang	3892	B
	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
yeah i'm making a baby Afghan uh for my daughter-in-law's sister-in-law who's expecting baby number one at age forty	3892	B
so i feel uh i feel like she needs a goody	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
uh-huh	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
oh my	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
no i- i really don't uh in fact this is the first thing i've crocheted in in uh some time	3892	B
but uh my grandmother taught me to crochet when i was five years old which is a long long long time ago	3892	B
so but i- i don't knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the the gauge doesn't work	3892	B
	3892	B
uh	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
hum i know i know	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
yeah well i'll tell you how i sort of feel about it	3892	B
i- i feel like uh of course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity	3892	B
but it- it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else is doing it	3892	B
uh the the if it's not real recreation	3892	B
it's- it's it's not doing you any good	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
uh-huh	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
no no it doesn't it you either do it or or you either like it or you don't you either have a knack for it or you don't uh	3892	B
and and and uh again i- i feel like that	3892	B
if there's something else that you'd rather do uh	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
some people have a natural green thumb	3892	B
uh and uh if that's what you like to do fine but if you don't	3892	B
then uh get a second job and hire somebody	3892	B
do something that you like to do uh	3892	B
life is too short uh	3892	B
i enjoy crocheting it it's real recreational- recreation for me but	3892	B
uh and and i used to sew a lot but uh and i just don't have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending	3892	B
but uh you know uh if you don't like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and uh	3892	B
	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
hum-um dump it	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
<silence>	3892	B
	3892	A
well what hobbies do you have	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
oh you do	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
	3892	A
are you making an Afghan	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
oh how wonderful	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
oh my goodness	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
well i have a sister-in-law who had a baby at age	3892	A
forty and i think again at forty three so she's	3892	A
but i'm expecting too so on my first	3892	A
but um i don't uh the only thing i really have done in the past is um	3892	A
uh cross stitch and needlepoint	3892	A
um i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels	3892	A
where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven	3892	A
i've done that kind of stuff but i haven't done anything as big as an Afghan	3892	A
do you do that often	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
um-hum yeah that	3892	A
um i just haven't been	3892	A
oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt	3892	A
um i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that that make them_1 but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays	3892	A
you know because i work full-time outside the home	3892	A
	3892	A
and then you don't have the time because_1 you're tending to the child	3892	A
but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
right	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
yeah i think that's true um like some people make uh um decorating their house a hobby	3892	A
and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that	3892	A
you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does	3892	A
and so uh you know we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a cop out but yet	3892	A
if if i- i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it	3892	A
but um my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with age and with years of experience- you know	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
yeah	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
um-hum um-hum	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
yeah	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
yeah isn't that true	3892	A
we uh in fact mending it- you- even kind of has gone by the wayside for some- most for many people if they get a hole in their sock	3892	A
they don't darn it they they uh	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
 uh throw it away and buy a new pair	3892	A
<silence>	3892	A
but um	3892	A
yeah there's a lot of things that i think that i'd like to do	3892	A
but i don't make the time to do them_1 you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then i'll have more time to do it and um	3892	A
because_1 i like committing a a great amount of time to something if i'm working on it	3892	A
	3835	B
i'm fine i want to know where you're from	3835	B
oh are you	3835	B
i i am too	3835	B
are you at the Christ United	3835	B
are you in Christ United Methodist	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
oh okay	3835	B
well okay well um anyway um i'm with a a choir and and we've been doing this as a fund raiser i wasn't sure if they were still doing it or not but i know that's not what we're supposed to talk about	3835	B
okay i'm having dinner right now and and on the subject of food so just continue and you tell me something you'd like to tell me about food	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
uh no i'm not actually i wish i were	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
oh that's going to be easy	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
oh well i guess my my favorite recipe that i've seen this week was fried green tomatoes did you see that in the paper	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
right right	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
well you know i don't guess i have i mean i'm from Mississippi originally and surely you know i don't even know that i've ever seen it offered to tell you the truth and but this- this evidently is a Southern delicacy that i didn't know about	3835	B
	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3835	B
right	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
well i tell you if you see that movie it'll make you want them_1	3835	B
oh yeah it just they just really make it look good now i love things like fried okra	3835	B
and i try not to ever have fried things but still you know if i i think uh that the fried green tomatoes would be something like that	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
probably you probably bread them and and uh you know like with corn meal and that kind of thing and then	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
fry them_1 in grease	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
ooh nice	3835	B

<silence>	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B

we saw it last Saturday and it was wonderful	3835	B
oh it really was	3835	B
uh-huh well it's either one	3835	B
yeah uh-huh it it has it's a story that would appeal to both men and women uh Dave liked it a lot huh	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
oh no now but my husband liked Steel Magnolias but it was more like this is more like Driving Miss Daisy did you see that and um and this probably is even a little more	3835	B
masculine than than Driving Miss Daisy even but it's that kind of movie that has just a universal appeal	3835	B
<silence>	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
	3835	A
well how you doing	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A

<silence>	3835	A
well are you are you having a Super Bowl party	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
well i was thinking now that would be a good place to exchange a recipe maybe um	3835	A
	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
no i didn't uh uh it's probably in reference to the movie i'm sure	3835	A
um i know my husband has heard about that and thought that that sounded really good are they i don't even i've never had fried tomatoes	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
huh	3835	A
i didn't know about it either now we i have had um marinated green tomatoes you know where you marinate them with onions and cucumbers but i don't i've never had fried	3835	A
fried green ones	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
oh really	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
	3835	A
	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
are they pretty does it look like it's a pretty easy thing to make	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
now i did i did go to a dinner this past weekend that was um	3835	A
at our church we had a church auction last fall and a lot of the things that were auctioned off were um services like a dinner for eight and then if you bought if you bought it	3835	A
there were two couples that two or three couples that might cater the dinner	3835	A
and one couple in our church had lived in the Philippines um years oh eight years ago and so they um auctioned off a Filipino dinner	3835	A
and um so it was really fun one of the things that we had were was fried um bananas but but not fried bananas i don't know what they're called but it's a it's kind of looks like	3835	A
the dough that they use for egg rolls	3835	A
i don't know what it's called but	3835	A
they put bananas in there and with cinnamon and i don't know what else and sugar and stuff and then they deep fry it	3835	A
and they use green bananas you know so that the bananas kind of stay together and i have fixed fried bananas before	3835	A
as a um Cuban or Spanish dish	3835	A
you know and they're really really good	3835	A
but um when you were talking about fried tomatoes it reminded me of this the fried bananas that	3835	A
you know	3835	A
yeah it was really a fun a fun thing to do a fun way to raise money	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
i'm up at Spring Creek	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
um manufacturing	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
oh really huh	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
okay okay so he's in a different group	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
yeah yeah i never can either i i mean i never can describe mine to my family or anything try to um i try to talk real real basic level when i get down to them	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
okay	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
was it	3835	A
is it a girl movie i mean is it is it something my husband would enjoy	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
because he doesn't like going to see girly movies like like um Steel Magnolias he didn't want you know	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
yeah yeah yeah	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
okay	3835	A
<silence>	3835	A
yeah i mean like i have to rent Beaches and you know some of those other movies	3835	A
	3832	A
well why don't you tell me about your lawn and gardening	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
do you do you have a large lawn	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
well i like the yard to look nice but i can't say i really enjoy it	3832	A
yeah no i've i've got other things that i like to do and that's that's not my favorite	3832	A
i don't know sweating- out there sweating in the sun you know and pulling weeds and those stuff	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
yeah and i won't mow the lawn either and you know watering the lawn is a pain in the butt because we don't have a an electric system so	3832	A
or sprinkler system i should say so	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
well what do you like to do when you garden	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
oh so you actually grow vegetables	3832	A
well that's nice	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
yeah you know i i find that gardening for me is just uh it it's expensive	3832	A
you know you get into buying as many plants that you need to make it look good and you know you can't just buy two or three you've got to buy a dozen for one small area	3832	A
you know so	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
exactly and i know we've got this spring we've got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because they're	3832	A
they kicked the bucket so	3832	A
well that means we'll just have to put something else	3832	A
and so but you know we haven't we hadn't had any freeze damage this year of course because it hasn't been that cold i guess it's been about the same with you all	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
yeah and i	3832	A
and the rain is unbelievable i mean it's just	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
we got a few a few flakes last week	3832	A
just enough to make it look you know i mean it didn't even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down	3832	A
yeah what about you	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
that's true that's true ours are well they're they're kind of dormant they're pretty mellow right now	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
in fact i just had a garden company come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your lawn give me an estimate because i just don't want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because because i don't know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed	3832	A
so i just let them treat all my weeds and i won't have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the garage	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
well yeah it's better for us because we don't we have a pretty small lawn	3832	A
so and and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than thirty bucks so	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
i don't think they do the ants i think they're just dealing with the weeds	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
no because we've got a real problem they're overtaking everything	3832	A
so but i mean we got some good grass but it's getting you know um	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
exactly it's getting choked out	3832	A
	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
you you still have onions growing	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
oh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
so so do you go uh give them away that you have so many	3832	A
you use them pretty much yourself	3832	A
well that's good	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
so the green onions the green onions grow into the	3832	A
the bigger onions	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
wow	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
well you sound like somebody that needs to come to my house and do a little work but	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
and that stuff fades away though right	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh so it doesn't cover- i mean it it it doesn't compete with the regular grass or anything	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
<silence>	3832	A
	3832	B
oh let's see it hurts um i don't know i do quite a bit of it	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
um pretty fairly fairly fair amount yeah yeah we switch plants here and there do you like to garden	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
oh really	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
oh no no i don't like that no	3832	B
no not that part just the pretty part	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
yeah i like to get out in the morning	3832	B
and that's it	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
oh mostly i like to keep a little garden	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right right right just like um salad salad vegetables that kind of thing	3832	B
and um	3832	B
that's about it	3832	B
just you know and shrubbery and everything and to keep the weeds down and stuff put mulch around it so you don't have to weed them	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
it really is	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right right	3832	B
so it doesn't look it looks skimpy if you don't	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
oh heaven	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
really	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right i think it's only frozen- um we've had a freeze twice	3832	B
and it wasn't very bad	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right right did you get any snow	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
oh you're kidding really	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
well that's nice	3832	B
no none none not none whatsoever so some of the plants are still kind of growing along	3832	B
so that makes it nice	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
yeah but soon it'll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in the spring and then it kind of dies down	3832	B
a little while later when you have to take care of everything	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
wow that's not bad	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
do they get get rid of the ants and stuff like that	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
oh oh	3832	B
not bad not bad at all though	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
to the point where the weeds are taking over the grass	3832	B
oh my	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
oh let's see i still have onions growing in the garden	3832	B
well they'll in Texas they'll go all year around	3832	B
and then if you want green onions you just go out there and grab some	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
no	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
yeah if you put them in all times of the year you can go out and take them you know for a green onion here and there and then if you have some left over they'll go to a a regular bulb onion and then you can have that the next um	3832	B
the next time next next year yeah	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
huh yeah they will if you let them alone and then you can put them anywhere sometimes i'll put mix them in with plants	3832	B
just have a bunch of green here and there	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
and then oh let's see and then um i put rye grass or my husband did put rye grass out this winter to make it look green	3832	B
um right you put it around September November to make it look green	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
right when it starts getting hot um	3832	B
it'll start dying down and your regular grass will come back in	3832	B
in the	3832	B
<silence>	3832	B
no no no no huh-uh it has real shallow roots everything but you got to get out and mow it it looks nice for a while and then it goes away and it kind of fertilizes the grass that's there all the time	3832	B
	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
um no not really i uh i may have had to have a	3891	B
a few minor repairs but i haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future i'm gonna be buying a big computer and	3891	B
um one of these eight millimeter camcorders	3891	B
so i've been i've been studying these things but uh i haven't had to return too many things i	3891	B
	3891	B
and	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
i think it really turns down to	3891	B
picking who you want to buy from and i hate to say it but the field- the electronics devices that i buy the the ones in Japan in generally	3891	B
are much higher quality from working	3891	B
 i mean i hate to admit it but it's true they and they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
	3891	B
that was made in China	3891	B
works just fine and it cost me four dollars	3891	B
	3891	B
yes it's amazing isn't it	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
yes	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
uh-huh	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
that's right and and and that's been really um way it's been for me for the last five or six years that- i returned a TV set to be repaired but the problem was that uh we had a a lightning storm and	3891	B
the lightning flashed in through the power and uh hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just uh one of those circumstances	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
no	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
well i tell you most of my talks are in Texas that's true i but i've been- i've been uh talked into um California twice in the last uh week or two	3891	B
	3891	B
	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
yeah	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
 well we're being filled up with a lot of	3891	B
of stores that have huge quantities of of uh clothes and articles and you know we've got Wal-Marts and Gee- Gee Bees and a whole bunch of things and	3891	B
i don't know how we can support all of those things and the and- and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them_1 on the market cheaper for the public	3891	B
and when that happens more of those products are likely to have uh inferior working ability and that's when you have to start returning them_1	3891	B
so	3891	B
yeah	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
 that's right and i- i- i have a friend who does make uh beautiful furniture but he has to charge twice as much when you go to a store	3891	B
if it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it	3891	B
 yep	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
huh	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
yes	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
do you	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
hum	3891	B
actually i had some uh i bought a water softener for my home	3891	B
and i didn't have to return it but it didn't work well and i finally- i finally had to have the company come out and to check it out so i did have that problem	3891	B
and it was a matter- i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself	3891	B
<silence>	3891	B
 okay have you had to return anything lately that you've bought	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
yeah	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
oh yeah that'll be nice	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
i haven't either really	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
right right well i think it's gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have to return it most most places are willing to you know go with the customer	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
on uh yeah i know that- i know	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
that's true that's true i haven't had to return anything that i can think of but uh you know with- like radios and things they've become so cheap that even if they do break it's better just to go get another one than have it fixed	3891	A
	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
yeah uh the stuff like that you know	3891	A
yeah and i you know like television and stereos and things they're a lot cheaper if they're Japanese made	3891	A
you know i've i've gotten to the point where i think so but um i've had to return um i think a television one time and um	3891	A
uh the color went out but and it was like a month later and i didn't have any problem whatsoever which i think is good but	3891	A
you know years ago you didn't never have to return anything everything worked for so long	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
oh yeah	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
well that's not bad at all well this is the first time i've ever gotten anybody outside of Texas	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
really	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
wow	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
	3891	A
	3891	A
um clothes is about mainly what i've you know gotten lately and i think they've gone downhill	3891	A
as- as far as unless you it's you get what you pay for	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
right	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
that's true	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
right	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
yeah	3891	A
yeah i agree with you it's kind of hard for the small man	3891	A
to make it you know with the the homemade thing	3891	A
you know	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
right	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
wow that's pretty interesting	3891	A
 hum	3891	A
let me think of something else here	3891	A
um i can't that's the only thing i can think of is clothes you know and and they're going up so high if you want a well made you know piece of clothing	3891	A
or in matter of fact furniture also you know you have to go you have to pay a lot more it's the old adage you get- get what you pay for	3891	A
but um you know and you can get oh i know i bought a real cheap couch one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didn't last very long you know	3891	A
i think the frame of it wasn't really good because_1 it was probably mass produced	3891	A
you know	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
hum	3891	A
<silence>	3891	A
do you have a problem with your water heater	3891	A
if you-	3891	A
	3881	A
what what you have some ideas on the to help out the President here	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
right i- i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
right people get get where they depend on the the benefit and they don't have much interest and there is no uh	3881	A
uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesn't get continued there's there's a lot of waste as a result i think of that	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
yeah	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
yeah	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
well uh i	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
yeah i think there's uh there's a good opportunity if they'll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh	3881	A
if and combine the savings there with with the savings in	3881	A
all these uh give away programs and and then waste that's in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just	3881	A
continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that don't do any good	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
well there was a there was a study i don't know if you heard of it it was the Grace Commission	3881	A
uh and it it he was uh a private uh individual and he did a study on on cutting waste out of government and he came up with	3881	A
i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
uh-huh	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
right yeah you wonder if all that is necessary and that's the same in government i guess it's is it all necessary	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
yeah yeah it it perpetuates a lot more jobs i think is what it does	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
but but	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
uh-huh	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
yeah well	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and that's something the government has never really tried hard to do uh	3881	A
they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have	3881	A
uh there's no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when you're going into debt to do it	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
	3881	A
<silence>	3881	A
<silence>	3881	B
uh	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
i think that uh one of the things they're going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at what's important and what has a return on investment	3881	B
uh there's an awful lot of federal programs that uh	3881	B
they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
and there's some things some programs that just don't seem to be working at all	3881	B
uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs they're just seem to be self perpetuating	3881	B
and uh	3881	B
uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved	3881	B
just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them_1 no incentive whatever to to solve their own problems	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh	3881	B
they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family	3881	B
so that's resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare	3881	B
and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around	3881	B
and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation	3881	B
I know that	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
um-hum	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
yeah	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
well i know that uh	3881	B
well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator	3881	B
and work out a a one or two page cost proposal	3881	B
and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program	3881	B
we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh of nonsense to for somebody to go read	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
you know	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
and uh you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do why	3881	B
	3881	B
and	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
uh and i- i think one of the problems we're having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh	3881	B
when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor	3881	B
and now it seems like there's uh as many administrators and administrative assistants as we have teachers	3881	B
and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
um-hum	3881	B
<silence>	3881	B
and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things	3881	B
uh we have a	3881	B
a new sewage treatment facility near here	3881	B
that's uh one of the fine EPA approved things that does a super job of cleaning up the water	3881	B
and they have an administrative building associated with it	3881	B
that uh has-	3881	B
	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
well i haven't heard any of the specific details of uh what they have planned but uh	3836	B
basically the noise around Washington is that uh they're concerned that uh there's not enough health care insurance provided that uh very few families have uh health care insurance or	3836	B
any kind of uh coverage where they're employed	3836	B
uh i'm not sure that there's any real plan afoot	3836	B
to uh bring a health care plan on line that requires everybody to kick in like uh Social Security	3836	B
but uh one of the plan that's been circulated about is a requirement	3836	B
that employers provide uh health care insurance for their employees and kick in something like eighty percent of the cost of that insurance	3836	B
and uh if they don't do that then they have to pay into a federal fund that provides the uh health care insurance	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
i tell you one thing that uh we were discussing this evening here that uh discourages me a little bit and worries me about the health care system	3836	B
uh i know that certainly in this region uh that the number of students graduating from dental school has been quite large	3836	B
and a lot of the foreign students that uh came and stayed in this country didn't go back home	3836	B
so there's been a kind of dentists are kind of glut on the market and they're uh having a lot of trouble competing and making ends meet	3836	B
and uh physicians i think may be facing the same situation except they apparently have a very strong	3836	B
organization and they are actually preventing students from entering medical college	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
well i think that's sort of happened universally to all our industries i think our light plane industry went out of business because the uh cost of uh manufacturers' product liability was too high	3836	B
uh but i think on the other side of the coin that uh maybe the AMA is being a little bit too protective of some of their physicians uh	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
yeah i've i've got my own set of war stories uh my daughter uh turns out she's allergic to gnats	3836	B
and the first time i went in to have it treated it cost two thousand five hundred dollars	3836	B
and the second time i went to a different doctor and the doctor said oh she's allergic to gnats give her some Benadryl that was a two dollar and forty five cent treatment for it	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
and so uh you know four days in the hospital the children's ward on IV penicillin uh was a lot less effective than a couple of teaspoons full of Benadryl	3836	B
and i have other friends that uh have really been misdiagnosed	3836	B
and i think it's probably a shame that there isn't more competition among doctors and there isn't a little more policing	3836	B
uh of the results	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
<silence>	3836	B
	3836	A
let's see um	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
have you heard anything in particular about the universal health care system- uh health insurance program that they're talking about	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
and it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan	3836	A
yeah especially for major corporations	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yes	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
well	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
oh yeah they keep uh the AMA you've got to go through the AMA to get accepted into medical school	3836	A
and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in	3836	A
but uh now dental school that's yeah if they've got a glut on the market of dentists um	3836	A
i i i don't mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high	3836	A
and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i don't think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such	3836	A
that's probably the worst thing about health care right now is the unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice and	3836	A
it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didn't do something wrong rather than proving that he did	3836	A
and if he doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
then suddenly he's got you know two or three years wages down the toilet but uh	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
uh-huh	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah there are physicians getting away with murder	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yes	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
<silence>	3836	A
yeah uh	3836	A
from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion	3836	A
they're not feeling you know insulted they're it's like that's a little you know sweat off my brow simply because	3836	A
i mean you know they're- they're covering their own tail legally and you know a second opinion	3836	A
 declined that	3885	A
San Francisco has more crime than Texas	3885	A
	3885	A
it's a it's a difficult question i don't know that i uh can easily come up with an answer to what can be done	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
i think probably drugs have a lot to do with crime in our society today so	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
no no	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
it's it's hard to know actually whether the	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
crime um impact would	3885	A
be better or would- would decrease or would increase if there were some changes in the way drugs are legislated i don't know if	3885	A
i have uh an opinion yet about uh legalization of certain kinds of drugs but	3885	A
uh-huh boy there's certainly a lot connected with that you know	3885	A
organized crime as well as	3885	A
huh	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
well i guess	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
yeah i grew up in a pretty small town and i'm not sure that um	3885	A
the size of the community or the general appearances safety really has as much to do with it because because you're seen as an enclave You might get hit by somebody from the outside anyway	3885	A
um i guess on a on a local level uh i i was thinking when i heard the question about major changes in the country today but it's probably a little easier now that i think about it if i look at what an individual could do and obviously	3885	A
if you have lights on and you have uh uh a timing system for your lights in your own home you're going to reduce the risk of being broken into	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
right right looking less like a victim	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
neighborhoods watching each other	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
yes	3885	A
in a southern California suburb It was outside of Long Beach kind of near Huntington Beach	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
oh really yeah	3885	A
i've lived in San Francisco for about thirteen years now and um probably have learned by	3885	A
uh indirect and direct experiences about things to do to you know avoid those kind of situations but i think part of it's just as you grow	3885	A
as you mature you you recognize um how to present yourself in a public situation so that you don't look like you are a victim a potential victim	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
it's a hard thing to communicate to kids isn't it	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
i have a two year old	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
no no but you know as a child we were able to uh ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our friends and those are things that i'm not sure i'd be comfortable with when she gets to bike riding age you know	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
that's interesting how large a community is that	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
uh-huh and and Plano what would you say is the population	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
because sometimes it's hard to you know i i look at small towns that have had problems with kidnappings and i think	3885	A
well the you know they're not on the edge of some large metropolis Um you know it's hard to even	3885	A
look at the factors that influence that happening why why in that particular you know	3885	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
uh-huh do you find yourself teaching your children things that uh you you know that they need to do but you didn't have perhaps in the way of level of awareness at an early age	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
uh-huh how how do they respond to that when you tell them about kidnappings at what age were they ready for that	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
uh-huh how old were were they when you introduced that subject	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
uh-huh huh	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
<silence>	3885	A
oh gosh a scary experience	3885	A
<silence>	3885	B
than Plano Texas yeah i sure am	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
i don't think there is an answer of what would make crime go away there's no such thing	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yeah i think you're right	3885	B
have you ever had your house broken into	3885	B
i haven't either	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
that's for sure	3885	B
that's for sure	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
i've never really been a victim of a crime and i've never had my car stolen or my house broken into or	3885	B
any of that so	3885	B
i've always lived in suburbs i don't know if that has anything to do with it or not but	3885	B
	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
right there's so many things that you can do in that way and you know going into parking lots with	3885	B
with your keys out being prepared you know being on the defensive	3885	B
right	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yeah we have a neighborhood crime watch where i am where did you grow up	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
uh-huh	3885	B
yeah well my girls and i were just just down there this Christmas they play soccer and so we were down in that same area	3885	B
	3885	B
 yeah	3885	B
but	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
that's right yep	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
it sure is do you have children	3885	B
yeah they're not afraid of much at two	3885	B
	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yep i can understand that you know as we were traveling back from that same soccer tournament i was telling you about we stopped in Mesa Arizona	3885	B
and i was just amazed at the freedom that those kids felt they just don't have i mean even here in Plano Texas i worry when my kids	3885	B
walk you know a block	3885	B
and we talked to some of our relatives there and they said you know we just don't worry about that there aren't kidnappings and there aren't	3885	B
there isn't that element here yet	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
um i don't really know it's not real big it's right outside of Tucson	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
uh i don't know that either	3885	B
it's	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
why it would happen here and not there	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
yep	3885	B
i guess you just have to kind of look for a family environment and and neighborhood and hope for the best you know and just	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
sure	3885	B
sure it- and it's so frightening because you have to teach them to be scared all the time	3885	B
	3885	B
and to really be cautious	3885	B
	3885	B
well they don't know any other way they don't know any other way i mean they weren't raised when i was when you didn't worry about that everyone worries about that now so they just assume that you'll always have to be on your guard	3885	B
and this	3885	B
<silence>	3885	B
oh real young i mean i can remember when my my oldest daughter is thirteen today	3885	B
and when she was just three i took her to the Sun Valley Mall do you know where that is	3885	B
 yeah i grew up there in Concord	3885	B
anyway and um she had gotten lost	3885	B
and it started right then	3885	B
you know and every person i would see that had a little girl you know tucked under their arm i'd run you know	3885	B
to see if that was her	3885	B
oh yeah	3885	B
 okay Gene so it's nice to talk with you and um food is a very intriguing thing our lives are are built around foods that we like and and nutritionally good for us what kind of dining out do you like	3898	A

<silence>	3898	A
i know the name but i haven't been there	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A

<silence>	3898	A
i'll be darn	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
well we're we're supposed to be talking about dining out but i'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from Penn State	3898	A
and uh all my work has been in research for the Navy	3898	A
	3898	A
underwater acoustics	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
um-hum	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
oh you grew up in Orlando uh-huh	3898	A

uh end of last month	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
i certainly have	3898	A
so what- i hate to uh i wish i could talk to you about that uh but uh i guess we should continue on uh	3898	A
okay how do you like Chinese food	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
well i uh enjoy the Szechuan type of uh Chinese food	3898	A
yes yep um it's it's i i do a lot of Chinese cooking myself i have in the past i haven't done it recently but uh it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like that are just really delicious meals	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
um just at home	3898	A
i- i enjoyed the food and i bought a lot of uh	3898	A
good cookbooks and i've been following through on that when you find the right cookbook why it works out	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
okay well that one's a good question here it's right under my nose if i can find it	3898	A
	3898	A
oh boy	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
yeah right	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
one of the the this book i have is called Chinese Cooking Made Easy	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
um	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
it's a paperback and i think it's by someone named Chang yeah Isabelle Chang	3898	A
<silence>	3898	A
yeah yeah i think you'll enjoy that	3898	A
well it certainly is nice talking with you Gene and uh what is your phone number at home	3898	A
	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
yes sir	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
well there is two kinds one i guess i'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh	3898	B
oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant uh you know something nice	3898	B
and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy	3898	B
uh recently we've been hitting Pancho's up it's a local Mexican restaurant pretty heavily because they've got a good rate on the you know good prices and everything	3898	B
yeah yeah it's it's a chain down here- uh it goes up into Colorado and down here i don't know where else it is what about you	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
oh yeah	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
i think think it might be i've seen- i think i've seen it around yes sir yeah	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
oh do you yeah	3898	B
oh we we do too we uh we enjoy Mexican food i'm just not impressed with the quality of it it's just primarily the price that's uh	3898	B
satisfying at this point but the kids seem to enjoy it um	3898	B
and uh let's see we've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here but it's uh	3898	B
not part of a chain it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant but the first one we've been to that	3898	B
uh i don't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had that was uh not just really super it's nice to find a place like that	3898	B
you know yeah	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
um	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
oh boy have you ever been to uh what is it Original Book Binders in Philadelphia	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
uh that's an old established uh restaurant i used to go there when i was in college	3898	B
i went to the Naval Academy and we used to we used to go up there on uh for football games sometimes	3898	B
and have some liberty and yeah we'd go over there to uh pretty sure it was original Original Book Binders i think it was yes	3898	B
i haven't been back there in years	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
okay what area	3898	B
is that right did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando Florida	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
yes sir my dad worked there for years and years that's where- that's uh that's where i grew up was down in Orlando so	3898	B
that's uh that's interesting well i was in submarines uh	3898	B
okay yeah must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there when- when did you retire	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
 well great i'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics	3898	B
yeah	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
okay right first	3898	B
oh we we do enjoy that yes sir uh i don't know if we're particularly adventurous we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh	3898	B
at a particular restaurant and then we usually stick by it but do you what about you	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
hot um-hum	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
um where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
um-hum	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
uh-huh what's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
i guess one of the things we've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that but we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh seafood- you know even uh shrimp uh	3898	B
dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
okay thanks for that uh reference	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
-okay good yeah	3898	B
<silence>	3898	B
	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
yes i'm still here	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
well that	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
no i think i think it's on i'm i'm so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work the other day people are wondering how to choose a college	3861	A
and i was wondering how what did your parents do to help you choose a college	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
oh	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
 oh yeah	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
oh	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
hum	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
so you got to choose a college twice	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
good grief	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
um	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
that was the same way in in my family of course my parents were divorced so it was just mother and my grandparents	3861	A
but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do	3861	A
and i got a a co-op	3861	A
deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out	3861	A
	3861	A
<silence>	3861	A
New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology	3861	A
and that choice	3861	A
 yeah it was but men out women numbered the women about twenty or thirty to one	3861	A
	3861	A
but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available	3861	A
and it	3861	A
yeah yeah	3861	A
but then i	3861	A
my next choice in college was hey i move back with- home with mom and i i went to the local university to get my grade point back up	3861	A
so a decent school would let me in	3861	A
	3861	B
uh oh	3861	B
are you still there	3861	B
oh i know what it was the answering machine must have run out of	3861	B
	3861	B
i i heard something click and i was like oh no it disconnected us	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
uh-huh	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said	3861	B
um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know Dad said well you know you're a smart kid so	3861	B
you're going to college and you're going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know	3861	B
the different professions and i was kind of like i didn't even know you know	3861	B
i had no clues so i said dad-	3861	B
well i can't stand the sight of blood so a doctor is out and uh i'm not i can't do math so a lot of stuff is out um	3861	B
i didn't think i'd be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a lawyer because i think they help people	3861	B
boy was i stupid	3861	B
so Dad said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer	3861	B
so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff my dad kind of said well uh what's the best law school in the country	3861	B
and all his friends told him Harvard and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too	3861	B
so i was like okay fine	3861	B
so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it	3861	B
you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through Radcliff because	3861	B
used to Harvard was for the boys and Radcliff was for the girls	3861	B
and even though they were combined	3861	B
you know even though they had to let women in Harvard you still had to apply through Radcliff so	3861	B
i did all this and uh a Radcliff alum here in Dallas did my interview and basically Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system	3861	B
and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know	3861	B
wasp type person so i'm not really	3861	B
you know they had this minority recruitment thing	3861	B
so and sure enough about two weeks before school started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl	3861	B
and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start the next day so	3861	B
University of Texas was where my dad went to school and luckily it's kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes the day after i registered	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
yeah by myself	3861	B
i mean my parents didn't really you know my dad was the first	3861	B
well my mom	3861	B
 they were the first people in their families that had been to college	3861	B
which i know like people from the east coast	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
colleges are all around you you know	3861	B
and so everybody goes to college or it's more normal i think because_1 a lot of my friends that are from the east coast you know everybody in their family's been to college but out here you know in fact my mother hasn't really been to college college they had a junior college	3861	B
that was fairly close by and and so she that's all she ever did was go to junior college	3861	B
just you know two year college and and got her degree but you know then my dad went back to school and finished school and went to professional school	3861	B
but that was after my brother and i were already little kids so nobody in my family really knew how to advise me	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
oh yeah	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
well where did you go to school in New Mexico	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
	3861	B
i bet that was neat	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
wow	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
yeah	3861	B
that is really critical these days i think	3861	B
<silence>	3861	B
oh yeah	3861	B
	3861	B
	3824	B
uh creates some conversation anyway	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
oh no i i think uh i think they're honest i i you know there are some exceptions i think for the majority of them are honest and uh i just think in uh especially in the federal government the thing has just become bigger than	3824	B
both of us all of us and it's just too big to handle and uh i think they look uh	3824	B
they look a lot- fairly incompetent at times and and i just think it's	3824	B
i think they mean well they have good intentions and i as you know as far as the topic goes we as far as i'm concerned they're basically honest people but uh	3824	B
	3824	B
oh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
oh i don't know what that go ahead go	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
	3824	B
let me get this other thing here hold on a second	3824	B
	3824	B
hello	3824	B
okay i don't know what that was	3824	B
uh no i just think the	3824	B
the uh federal government especially is just so huge i mean problems are so big and uh it's so	3824	B
internationalized that uh i don't know it just i don't know what the solution is but uh i don't think they're in it for their own personal gain uh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
right	3824	B
well	3824	B
considering that they have to live up there i mean the living conditions up there i mean not the conditions but the private- cost of living is atrocious and uh	3824	B
uh i don't think a lot of them are making uh netting a whole lot of money once they leave up there	3824	B
but uh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
right and they're just one of uh five hundred and thirty five and you're just talking about the Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
well i think anytime you've got a a Republican administration and a uh oh a so-so senate as far as uh the split between the Democrats and the Republicans and then the democratic uh House uh whoever's in power	3824	B
is going to have their hands full and uh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
no but uh it's too bad uh but i think it's like a lot of things whether it's a company or an organization of some kind or the goverment- federal government it's uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh	3824	B
you don't have the proper controls in place well then it's going to get out of hand and people are going to look silly kind of foolish foolish and silly when they're uh trying to operate that thing	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
right	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
i know our state government gets a lot of heck as well down here and uh i don't know about of course about states- i don't pay a whole lot of attention to the state government uh we've got a	3824	B
a female governor and she ran against a real clown here a year or so ago and both of them neither- there just wasn't a whole lot to pick from	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
right	3824	B
uh Richards uh Ann Richards is the governor she won then Clayton Williams was the guy that ran against her and he was a west Texas uh rancher and so forth	3824	B
but uh they were both a	3824	B
couple of clowns	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
well they	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
they had a good time it was serious business but i think they enjoyed themselves and a lot of people down here just	3824	B
oh	3824	B
not really she i think uh they she's been in office just about a year now and uh	3824	B
as far as her public uh public opinion surveys i think they give her about a fifty fifty rating she she hasn't uh destroyed the place but the economy down here is in pretty bad shape and she can't do much about that	3824	B
but uh she's she's done okay that who's to say how he would have done he he's a business man he's been successful i i	3824	B
if i had voted i would have voted for him but she's done all right	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
um	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
um	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
she a Republican	3824	B
oh yeah	3824	B
well you	3824	B
	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
um	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
is that right	3824	B
<silence>	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
well she's going to have to do	3824	B
	3824	A
yeah yeah so what do you think do you think they're honest or they in for it themselves	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain they're probably	3824	A
	3824	A
they what was that your other line or	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah but they'd probably you know they'd stay in for ten or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a consultant for some of these private industries that	3824	A
okay	3824	A
sure thing	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
it's still me	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah there's actually you know you think you know they get paid what a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand that's really not all that much compared to	3824	A
what	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
no	3824	A
oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty idealist approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is and	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
exactly	3824	A
well you look at even the President you know he's got to fight against all you know the other five hundred thirty five to get anything through anyway so	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah it doesn't	3824	A
not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
exactly	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah and like you say it's	3824	A
you know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing and the do- you know even mouth sometimes are doing- going the opposite direction so	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah well there was that was a lot of that was public- quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that Richards wasn't that her name	3824	A
gal that won	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
so are they doing any good is she doing any good or	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah did we just uh we got our first woman mayor up here in Salt Lake uh just this past election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but she's a business woman and that's what she was really pushing was	3824	A
business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because	3824	A
you know she's kind of a self-made i don't know if she's a millionaire but she you know got her own businesses and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so	3824	A
uh no she's Democrat	3824	A
which uh	3824	A
actually Salt Lake and the county around Salt Lake is quite a bit Democrat so it's not really surprising we've had a a a Democratic mayor for quite a few years	3824	A
uh the state as a whole is probably more definitely more Republican but	3824	A
yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's	3824	A
she's already stepped on a few toes i think she's making the changes but	3824	A
<silence>	3824	A
	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah well i've had them_1 uh where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people um and i had help with them_1 um and	3804	B
part of them_1 i did were like a buffet and uh it i had uh	3804	B
just different uh side dishes and appetizers and one of them_1 that that i'd remembered was uh	3804	B
some uh sausage hors d'oeuvres and uh	3804	B
 anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh	3804	B
cups of Bisquick and uh	3804	B
sausage oh like a a Owens mild you can i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to yeah and uh you	3804	B
put that in and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and	3804	B
make- make it all doughy and then like i just put them_1 in little balls and bake them_1 for about fifteen minutes and they are so good	3804	B
yeah it's making me hungry for them_1 right now	3804	B
have you yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
i i've used that quite a bit and it and it seems to work real well um and uh um	3804	B
 when i've had so many people uh to- to feed like i'd try to do a ham	3804	B
an a turkey and and	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
um-hum	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
no what	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
oh i'll bet	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah i'll have to try that	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
i like things that are easy and and uh	3804	B
nutritious	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
i know i know well thank God for microwaves you know	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
um-hum um-hum	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
right well i don't anymore yeah it's been a few years and and uh	3804	B
 i don't have you know over a couple either and and uh i try to	3804	B
 uh have everything all ready and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where i don't spend- spend all my time in the kitchen	3804	B
and uh spaghetti and	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
oh yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
i like it too	3804	B
i do too	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
um-hum	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah well have you had any good ideas yet oh okay	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
and that's the way to do it too	3804	B
 i think it's you know what's i think is so nice is that	3804	B
 in this day and time that we can have good food	3804	B
that's good for you and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen and and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it	3804	B
well	3804	B
<silence>	3804	B
<silence>	3804	A
okay Cindy you there	3804	A
okay what kind of dinner parties have you had	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
uh-huh	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
uh-huh	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
whatever you like huh yeah	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
hm	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
oh that sounds delicious yeah	3804	A
yeah you know i've made like little Swedish meatballs but they're just made out of the beef you know	3804	A
and uh with spices and things in them_1 but never anything mixed with Bisquick	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
um-hum hm	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
yeah that's my that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time	3804	A
you know i've uh i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here	3804	A
 uh which i had uh things like that but i always cooked them_1 ahead of time and then i just sliced them	3804	A
you know and had macaroni salad with uh shrimp in it have you ever had that	3804	A
get some fresh little fresh shrimp and it's in your macaroni salad that you make	3804	A
the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor	3804	A
 yeah i don't like the can but the fresh you know	3804	A
yeah that was really good	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
yeah right right but uh at uh Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know	3804	A
which is kind of hard because you got so many people and then by time you pass everything around it seems like everything on your plate's cold	3804	A
 so but anyhow i	3804	A
yeah you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know	3804	A
but uh other than that i- i don't have too- too many parties uh you know i have like maybe just a couple- another couple over for dinner	3804	A
but uh other than than than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of people like except except at Christmas and i have my family	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
yeah right right	3804	A
yeah that's easy i always like to have that too you know everybody seems to like that too	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
no everybody likes that	3804	A
 and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast that's what i love	3804	A
with my	3804	A
 and um other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what goes- next weekend when the Super Bowl's on	3804	A
 i've asked a couple people to come over and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that	3804	A
no not yet no and i you know i don't want to have to come away from the TV i want something that i can just take them_1 and serve them_1 while they're sitting in front of the TV	3804	A
 you know so i'll think of something just that- that we can munch on over there you know	3804	A
and they can just fill- fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down	3804	A
yeah yeah	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
yeah preparing it right	3804	A
<silence>	3804	A
oh it sure does	3804	A
well when i was brought up you know we didn't	3804	A
 all right uh yeah not as much as i used to be i- i grew up in Pittsburgh and	3859	B
did you yeah i left there i went to school out that way that about forty miles east of Pittsburgh and then uh	3859	B
i left in the mid sixties and right after i left well a few years later they started having some good teams	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah he's looking good he's sixty i think and he just you know	3859	B
yeah for considering	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
yeah they just uh i don't know what happened they just weren't getting any draft picks and weren't i guess they just weren't picking the right guy weren't right people	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
right	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
yeah they uh he was loyal to a lot of those guys that	3859	B
helped uh helped him win those Super Bowls in the seventies and uh stuck with him too long and then i think the	3859	B
the draft uh picks did fall on hard times and they just never were able to get back to where they were	3859	B
but uh uh we've lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years and i've never become a Cowboys fan in fact i don't i just don't like them_1 at all but	3859	B
 i	3859	B
oh i like them better than the Cowboys i don't i just uh	3859	B
other than the Steelers i don't have a real a real favorite uh like the Eagles i like the Redskins but uh usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing for the most part you're a Forty Niner fan	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
hum	3859	B
yeah yeah they had	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
yeah they weren't the same without Montana	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
oh was he calling the plays i didn't even	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
 yeah	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah he had a	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
right yeah well couple of those passes a couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped some important uh passes too they it would have made might have made a little bit of a difference not much but uh	3859	B
i don't i- i just looked in the paper this this evening and trying to figure out when the last time the AFC won a game guess it was eighty four Raiders	3859	B
Raiders beat uh the Redskins i think as a matter of fact but boy it's	3859	B
i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because_1 i'm getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
right	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
yeah well	3859	B
Buffalo twice- well they did get close last year they could have won last Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants	3859	B
but uh just seems like there's a big gap in talent between the or maybe in coaching between the AFC and the NFC because_1 it's like i said it's been nine years or eight years since they uh since AFCs won a game	3859	B
but uh i guess they're gonna somebody was saying uh somebody- i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
um-hum yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
well	3859	B
um yeah i just don't like it it it delays the game it delays uh i don't know it it just kind of interrupts- interrupts the flow of things and uh i	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
<silence>	3859	B
<silence>	3859	A
you say you a Steeler fan	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
so did i no kidding	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterday's Super Bowl	3859	A
he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
well that's what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think that's the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people	3859	A
um	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
no	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
how about_1 Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
well i had- you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um they've certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadn't lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game	3859	A
but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end	3859	A
well Montana made a difference but as the analysts- analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday	3859	A
Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i- i frankly am surprised that	3859	A
um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays	3859	A
yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i mean- you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself	3859	A
because_1 they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal	3859	A
and uh	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
it it's it's it's nine years ago	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah it's been- been a while	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
well it is it is a little disappointing and there's some it it's very interesting to see you know what's what's behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the the draft picks would uh	3859	A
you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference	3859	A
uh i don't understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didn't do anything uh Cincinnati they didn't do anything now uh Buffalo	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
well you know i think that's sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad	3859	A
i mean i just it's it's it's shameful and and i think that that once Pandora's out of the box you know	3859	A
so i don't know i- i- i- i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think it's it's reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call what-	3859	A
<silence>	3859	A
well there yeah there- there is that problem and- and- but uh i guess that that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid	3859	A
	3855	B
okay	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
oh we use them	3855	B
for paying our gas	3855	B
for paying	3855	B
uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks so we use it quite a bit	3855	B
but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards	3855	B
if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free so we never have to pay anything extra	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah we just don't think it's worth it	3855	B
so	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
uh-huh	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
see well you i don't do it either	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
yes exactly that's how i feel- i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
	3855	B
yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our MasterCard or whatever	3855	B
and then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later	3855	B
and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a little- even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
oh yeah	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah even if it's five bucks even	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in	3855	B
and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt	3855	B
you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then	3855	B
you know you can have your card back with	3855	B
pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
i know	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah exactly	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah so	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
um	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
oh i also use like to use Discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah yeah	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
well we just started doing that and	3855	B
you know what it comes in handy is for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes	3855	B
because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but i mean it's still something we got two fifty last year	3855	B
and so it's you know it helps out here and there	3855	B
so	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year	3855	B
and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something	3855	B
and so that's what	3855	B
and i know we're going to get back more this year because they	3855	B
you know we spent a little bit more	3855	B
probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too	3855	B
and they increase the percentage a little bit	3855	B
<silence>	3855	B
yeah i pushed in	3855	A
so how do you use your credit cards	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
um-hum	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah that's me i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
you know and um i'm uh like you i i use it	3855	A
well to buy my gas with my Shell- my Shell credit card i use that	3855	A
and then like my Emporium card and uh	3855	A
Weinstocks card i use that but i'm like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i don't just write a check i don't know	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
you know it's just really weird but i i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah you know enough for a phone call and that's about all	3855	A
but uh	3855	A
other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't- they can't charge any more	3855	A
you know and i think that's terrible	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
oh yeah	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why	3855	A
it really does help	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
	3855	A
yeah	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because you- there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket	3855	A
they're going to hit you over the head	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
i know it just uh you know it just seems like they're somebody's always watching	3855	A
so i just don't i don't carry money i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
right	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah right	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah right	3855	A
and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything	3855	A
you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amount- i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you	3855	A
you know so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
well let's see what else can i say about credit cards	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
um	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah i don't i don't uh that that that's that Sears Discovery Card is that what that	3855	A
yeah now i don't have that one you know	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
oh you mean uh for for you using your credit card you get like a rebate or something	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
oh i see	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
um i see	3855	A
<silence>	3855	A
yeah well i'll	3855	A
	3864	B
well it was yes what do you think about the uh former Soviet Union	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
yeah	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
it seems that way sometimes you wonder if um an economic threat isn't gonna drive people to do things that would be more drastic than if uh they were a little bit more peaceful you know	3864	B
but i think it would probably not be a a threat to the United States if that was the case but probably to Europe other other areas of Europe there	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
well that's what it seemed like even before they uh dissolved the Union was that it was becoming less and less of a of a threat to the United States uh more and more of an attempted	3864	B
uh you know relating on more or less normal bases	3864	B
are you involved in	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
oh that's right	3864	B
that's for sure are you involved in any kind of uh political analysis or anything	3864	B
no not really we're involved in some of our company work in the Soviet Union in different places but not in	3864	B
uh any area of uh endeavor that would be of any interest to you know militarily or anything like that	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
uh linguistics primarily	3864	B
and so it's interesting to see uh how things are going there and and their the people that are there are facing the same kind of	3864	B
uh economic deprivation that uh you know the Russian citizens are but not- it doesn't relate to much to the military uh situation	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
yes	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
yeah i read an interesting- an article in a recent uh	3864	B
Wall Street Journal uh interview with a family there and	3864	B
you know we think of uh how great it is to go to a you know free market uh sort of thing and and they're saying- facing uh something that most people are not even aware you know familiar with they wouldn't- they don't know how to deal with it and uh how do you	3864	B
how do you compete when you you're whole you know life has been built on uh working for the state and everything you know things like that	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
yeah right	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
you face the same uh uh bureaucratic uh headaches whether you work or don't work so- and so now they've you know so really it must be uh really traumatic time for the people as well as the uh	3864	B
lack of supplies or anything like that adjusting to the new way of thinking about things	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
um-hum	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
yeah right	3864	B
taught to understand that's right yeah	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
well perhaps the uh if we give aid of some sort you know maybe it'll turn them_1 around if it's done done correctly you know economically-	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
sure	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
you mean in in our country or in	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
sure	3864	B
<silence>	3864	B
yeah you can't that's right and well i hope you know just hope we don't wait too long and and uh you know	3864	B
that's that's a timely kind of a question isn't it	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
i really don't think that i would consider them a threat any longer and i suppose that's primarily because	3864	A
their economy really won't allow them to uh expend a lot of	3864	A
resources on on war um if that were their primary concern	3864	A
and it'll be a while before they're an economic threat for sure	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
um-hum um-hum	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
 do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they would be a threat uh that given their political changes they would still be a threat or	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
um-hum um-hum	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
right	3864	A
there there've been such drastic changes in their political orientation that it's	3864	A
hard to predict what it will look like in fifty years but certainly so far what we've seen is a turn around from where things were fifty years ago	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
no no and yourself	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
really	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
uh-huh personal interests or business	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
uh-huh	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
yes	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
yes yeah their problems are definitely at this point economic it it seems that the whole infrastructure is focused on you know organizational um	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
skimming off the top you know especially the government but um it's gonna be awhile before the people adopt the philosophy that	3864	A
if you work harder you can also benefit personally and that	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
um-hum	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
um-hum	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
and and almost um the philosophy has been put in as little as you can because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so why spend the extra energy	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
uh-huh	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
yeah	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
i wonder too if their thinking hasn't been so influenced over the years that the Western way is bad that	3864	A
it would it's hard for them to look at some of the Western market place strategies as being good because they've been	3864	A
	3864	A
propagandized the other direction for so long	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
i think that they're one economy that i feel that that's worth the investment you know there are some	3864	A
um places in the world where i'm not sure that the money that the United States is putting in is really getting the kind of return that that's gonna benefit both parties but	3864	A
um it seems that there's such an effort to make it work there that what they really do need is is the loans and the	3864	A
uh strategic assistance from other countries i'll i'll be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesn't seem as though that's forth coming right now um	3864	A
that	3864	A
yeah i think well i was watching something the other day a news program that that indicated um	3864	A
the concern on Bush's part is that if he puts	3864	A
great interest in that area now he's gonna be accused of not spending enough time on the domestic issues you know certainly foreign issues are his strength so it's a catch twenty two	3864	A
<silence>	3864	A
	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
yes i do i uh go on long walks whenever i can and uh	3827	B
well when i when i can fit it into my schedule and the weather's right i like to walk uh oh three four miles a day	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
well that sort of same sort of thing happened to me i used to be a regular swimmer i i taught at a university and i you know could use the pool every day if i wanted and since moving away from the university environment i've uh	3827	B
now it's kind of difficult to find a pool that's convenient and affordable to swim in	3827	B
but uh what university were you at	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
did you say you're at the University of Iowa Iowa City huh	3827	B
i went- i visited- visited there once quite a few years ago had a friend who was in the linguistics department there	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
well you would do you have contact with any of the uh people in linguistics	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
yeah	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
well if you ever run into uh to Cathy Reagan say hi to her for me i think she's still there	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
um-hum	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
well how briskly do you walk do you think how how fast do you walk do you think	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well a brisk walker can go maybe what four or five miles an hour so if it takes you a third of an hour to get in you're probably going oh i would say at least a mile and a half probably	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go walking just about anytime i want to	3827	B
this winter though it's rained so much that uh there've been times where see my uh favorite	3827	B
uh area to walk is a a greenbelt they have right through Plano here and uh	3827	B
you know it's it surrounds a little stream over much- much of its extent you can walk for miles there and never cross a street you you go under the streets	3827	B
but uh when the uh when the water is too high uh you'd get washed away i mean they have signs up there warning people to stay away so	3827	B
we've had that uh a number of times recently not to mention the mud of course	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
well you can get you can do the other thing i do is uh i have a little exercise bike that uh wasn't too expensive i got a cheap one but you can really work up a sweat on it	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
yeah	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
yeah i- i really prefer outdoor exercise i'm afraid that my favorite indoor exercise is eating apple pie a la mode and that doesn't help very much	3827	B
	3827	B
<silence>	3827	B
 um Ashley um do you exercise regularly	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
uh-huh well that's pretty good i unfortunately uh am not um exercising regularly at the time um	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
i	3827	A
we've recently made a move i used to be at the university where there's facilities there and my wife and i regularly played um racquetball	3827	A
but um since we've moved to Iowa now um we don't have as many facilities like that um	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
i was at Brigham Young University	3827	A
um actually i am working at a university right now i just graduated with my PhD at Brigham Young and i'm working at the University of Iowa however	3827	A
we had all free benefits for faculty and staff and students at Brigham Young but um	3827	A
oh it's we the benefits here as far as um using the physical facilities are not free here so and plus they're not as convenient we're we're further away so it's not as convenient for like my wife to come in you know for doing things together	3827	A
uh-huh right uh-huh	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
oh	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
i'm in uh	3827	A
at the National Center for Voice and Speech which is part of the um Department of Speech Pathology	3827	A
um	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
well uh	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
i just- i haven't been here uh uh only for several months and uh i- i'm sure that there must be some cooperation between the departments but uh i'm not aware of anything as yet	3827	A
um	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
i	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
okay	3827	A
	3827	A
 okay usually when the temperatures are warmer um i live about twenty minutes from school so um	3827	A
from the university so i often will walk in which i guess it's i'm not sure how far it is um actually it's twenty five minutes and it's probably about a mile- i don't know long- it's got to be maybe a	3827	A
what	3827	A
oh i walk rather briskly but i don't i don't do it during these winter months it's just far too cold um	3827	A
so-	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
uh-huh	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
uh-huh	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
oh	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
oh yeah	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
but-	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
yeah if i were to begin- to begin exercise now i think it'd be something that i could do um	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
indoors something that's convenient	3827	A
um	3827	A
you know	3827	A
-it's like an exercise bike or something like that although i haven't purchased one purchased one yet sometimes i do- i have this little trampoline-	3827	A
small type trampoline that i do indoor jogging on sometimes for exercise but i haven't really started- been doing anything regular for the last several months since we've since we've moved to to Iowa	3827	A
<silence>	3827	A
	3827	A
well outdoor exercise is uh more convenient however-	3827	A
 well i guess we're uh	3887	B
forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that	3887	B
the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels- fuels are being experimented with ethanol and	3887	B
other types of fuels	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i	3887	B
i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from what comes over the border from us	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um	3887	B
do away with the CFCs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
 again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was	3887	B
uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
well it is scary and i think it will uh	3887	B
continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively	3887	B
we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
 i- i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that in Los Angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh	3887	B
 barbecues gasoline lawn mowers	3887	B
um and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles and it's gotten bad in Denver and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky	3887	B
and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
well that makes a lot of sense i mean i- i hadn't thought about it that way but it it	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
 no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth	3887	B
which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a uh a whole	3887	B
set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a	3887	B
big structural change in the economy	3887	B
uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in- in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars	3887	B
and uh i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but	3887	B
i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure	3887	B
how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy	3887	B
is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell	3887	B
<silence>	3887	B
	3887	A
uh	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
or sources	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
that's what i would think	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area	3887	A
uh any any industry that burns you know	3887	A
and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real	3887	A
into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick	3887	A
but i don't know if that affects outside	3887	A
you know i- i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it yeah	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah that's it it's kind of scary	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
i think it will	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
uh-huh	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
right	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
right	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah in this area too since you know in Texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh	3887	A
it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas	3887	A
and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in	3887	A
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
you don't have to have mountains there stopping it	3887	A
and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings and uh	3887	A
so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
right	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
um-hum	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
<silence>	3887	A
yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but	3887	A
	3848	B
	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
um okay	3848	B
subject is credit cards and how we use them	3848	B
okay	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
i guess so	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
now what's been your experience with credit cards	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
well i i uh i belonged to American Express many years ago	3848	B
and uh they had a reputation or at least they touted that uh don't go don't leave home without it type attitude that it was good in Europe and everywhere	3848	B
and i went on traveled in Europe and i was just absolutely appalled at uh	3848	B
the they it was useless	3848	B
and uh i think uh	3848	B
being overseas for about five weeks there was three occasions i got to use the card	3848	B
uh one little hotel out in the middle of nowhere in Scotland one little restaurant in Denmark and things like that	3848	B
and uh later i uh well i get in a scrap with uh American Express because they made some mistakes in my account and it just took too many letters to get it straightened out	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
well i	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
well it was something i don't remember the exact details so long ago uh they tried to sell me some kind of a special card	3848	B
you know gold card or super card or diamond card and so to do that they had to change my account	3848	B
and so	3848	B
some bills came in under the old account after they transferred all the money out	3848	B
and rather than credit you know move the bills to the new account and pay them off as they should they sent me this statement showing this huge interest charge on uh	3848	B
on the account	3848	B
and it took took me a while to get that straightened out	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
yeah well i tried writing letters to get it straightened out but it uh it took about eight months and i finally said cancel the account and	3848	B
after about four months they quit sending me letters	3848	B
uh	3848	B
and now i only carry one really uh my wife insisted that i get another credit card and uh so i do have a Visa card	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
uh-huh	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
yeah well i have another credit card our company when you travel uh because of the tax regulations they don't like to make cash advances	3848	B
uh because there's uh they're concerned with the tax liability there so uh rather than make a uh cash advance they issue a credit card and you just charge as you go	3848	B
and uh	3848	B
send your paper work in and by the time the credit card bill comes in presumably you have your check from the company the	3848	B
<silence>	3848	B
	3848	A
 never did worked for a lot of computer companies in my life but not that not TI	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
uh	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
credit cards	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
sounds like a good you ready to get started	3848	A
okay	3848	A
	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
i stay away from them no	3848	A
 uh i keep two i keep uh i got a Visa and it keeps a little balance on it not much and American Express is the one i use predominantly so i know i have to pay it every month	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
i know when i was younger twenty years ago or so i i got into quite a bit of hassle with them charging to the limit like to never caught them up	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
i've had oh one time i had an erroneous charge show up on it from some	3848	A
credit card protection company or something and that took me a few months to get that reimbursed and uh find out what was going on there they had authorized they had paid somebody without my authorization	3848	A
and	3848	A
i think the final letter was they were sorry that happened	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
boy	3848	A
yeah i've never gotten into an interest	3848	A
never gotten into an interest charge with American Express i know they have it but i just	3848	A
you know if you get it paid within the next thirty days or something you don't have one so	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
yeah it's kind of hard to get by without one you know it's	3848	A
i rent a lot of videos you got to have one there and different places and so you just about got to have a major credit card my favorites though are department store credit cards	3848	A
uh you can just stop in and shop when you want and don't have to worry about your check book or having cash	3848	A
and	3848	A
i found out with at least the two department stores we've done business with for years they treat you much nicer	3848	A
uh when you have a balance you pay it and	3848	A
there's never a problem with anything you want or anything uh and our give give the cards to my sons say here go get what you want	3848	A
that sort of thing	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
so those kind of particular credit cards i've always liked	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
<silence>	3848	A
right when i work that's the way we uh i had a	3848	A
corporate card with American Express with my company and	3848	A
everything was put on that they didn't care what was put on there just	3848	A
and i i usually	3848	A
i think one time in all those years i had a situation where my refund check you know my reimbursement checks hadn't gotten here in time to make you know a payment of five or six thousand i had every month too and	3848	A
i mean just one time	3848	A
<silence>	3876	B
okay so what- now what are your opinions on recycling	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah i've heard that too	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them_1 and uh that's- i can't remember where i went to take them_1 but they wouldn't- they wouldn't take them_1	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
oh i know	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
there's no really recycling facilities	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
i think that's a good idea	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in New York or isn't it	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
um-hum you get ticketed if you don't do it right	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah that's true	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah i've seen them_1	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
that take them_1 back	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
is Texas one of them_1	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at JC Penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling	3876	B
program that's um company wide and i do the recycling for that	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use	3876	B
but um we use to have uh i mean i- i don't even remember how much money that they've um mean- i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities but i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didn't you think of that before	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah that's true	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
then that's pollution	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
truly sad	3876	B
<silence>	3876	B
	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility	3876	A
until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late	3876	A
you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand	3876	A
and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my paper- i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take	3876	A
plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them_1	3876	A
and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait -until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
um-hum	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that cannot- glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out	3876	A
and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
i think so it's just because they have to you know	3876	A
right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and	3876	A
so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state i'm from	3876	A
uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay	3876	A
ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just	3876	A
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i don't know if you've tried it	3876	A
and they have on the back- it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that	3876	A
yeah well what- some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now	3876	A
Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them_1 away cause there is no place to take glass	3876	A
so	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
uh-huh	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
okay do they save like the paper they- they use like the office paper good because_1 there is a lot of waste there isn't there	3876	A
right	3876	A
right	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
right	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton	3876	A
you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business	3876	A
and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
yeah yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it	3876	A
and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried	3876	A
and i don't know it just may overwhelm us	3876	A
here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well	3876	A
that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it	3876	A
<silence>	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
and then just like the glass bottles that- that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and there's no place i can take glass to	3876	A
so i still throw away a lot of glass	3876	A
yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic-	3876	A
	3879	B
the Vietnam War	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
yeah i'm forty one so i would uh	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
well i uh was in college when the war escalated to it's height and uh	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
i guess my feeling is consistent with that of uh the general public that it was unfortunate	3879	B
event uh	3879	B
it's real interesting to think about it in the context of this new movie JFK which is	3879	B
apparently linking the Kennedy assassination to his decision to his- uh uh the apparently people uh who worked for Kennedy say he didn't decide that he was going to	3879	B
pull out of Vietnam was not going to commit more troops that that had nothing to do with the assassination of those people say but they that he had come to that conclusion	3879	B
i think it was uh	3879	B
particularly in light of recent events a really unfortunate mistake Communism was self destructing even then and uh	3879	B
the history of Vietnam which has been uh represented in a number of different commentaries and documentaries one on the public broadcasting system	3879	B
uh it seems that it just didn't have to happen and i think uh its a valuable	3879	B
uh if painful lesson for this country	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
right	3879	B
at the time i wasn't that uh	3879	B
wasn't that sure i- i- i really didn't know enough about it and wasn't that politically active uh	3879	B
but it was	3879	B
um	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
apparently something that could've been avoided and i you know i- i look at wars generally as falling into that category um	3879	B
 people are beginning to wonder whether or not the uh the Gulf War could've been avoided even though that was a remarkably painless war and as wars go	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
right	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
third world country really	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
well i think what what's uh i- i guess i'd use the word relevant to the Vietnam War question is that the Vietnam War was apparently avoidable too it was a time when Ho Chi Minh	3879	B
apparently came to the United States and said look if you're willing to provide me with support all i wanna do is unify Vietnam	3879	B
and uh he was turned away by Truman um	3879	B
so it's	3879	B
hum	3879	B
a painful lesson i guess one that we're beginning to learn i'm really impressed by how much effect some of these movies have had on public consciousness the JFK movie's cause causing one person after another to	3879	B
call for the release of the documents that have been sealed	3879	B
did you see any of the Vietnam Wars um any of the Vietnam war movies	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
oh the Deer Hunter	3879	B
yeah	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
those two yep	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
yeah they were they've	3879	B
yeah well they were both remarkable films as a matter of fact there's a new film out about the Vietnam War about the making of Apocalypse Now which itself is suppose to be a great yeah have you is it good	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
that's what people say i'm really looking forward to seeing his wife apparently made it from- documentary	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
oh is is that on film did- that- that get captured on film	3879	B
<silence>	3879	B
right right right	3879	B
yeah well i the thing i think is really neat about	3879	B
 uh it was about the Vietnam right	3879	A
yeah well uh	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
guess uh i'm twenty three are you older than i am	3879	A
so you probably have a better -opinion of of what	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
huh	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
right	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
um	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
yeah	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
yeah i mean looking back now know what we know now i mean it was just a complete disaster	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
yeah i just think	3879	A
that the Gulf War was just something that was really	3879	A
um	3879	A
i know it's i kind of look at it as a little bit of propaganda in a way because i mean we- basically- went in and spent i don't know how many billions of dollars and	3879	A
just beat up on a	3879	A
inferior yeah inferior army that was just wanting- wanting to quit and didn't have any food and i mean it's just i don't know how much pride one can really take in that and	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
 oh yeah that's just um	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
i've seen uh you know Apocalypse Now and um	3879	A
uh what was the one with um Christopher Waken and um	3879	A
The Deer Hunter yeah i've you know and the just a lot of other i guess inferior ones made but i mean as far i think Apocalypse Now and um Deer Hunter were just	3879	A
just incredible movies you know Deer Hunter's a little bit more of a incident but	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
yeah Heart of Darkness yeah i've seen that that was uh it's great they had it on Showtime um before they released it to theaters fact	3879	A
around the summer and uh it's really something it's almost it it's just as entertaining if not more entertaining than a film is because_1 it's	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
right she just shot documentary you know had like a little hand held camera and you know the whole thing's been edited together but when Martin Sheen had his heart attack it's just amazing what you know Frances is just	3879	A
it it doesn't capture the actual event it captures him getting uh some treatment after it happened but she had a tape reporter running when he was talking on the phone about it and	3879	A
he's just literally freaking out i mean about he's more concerned about the you know how because_1 he's as the whole time i guess when it was being made um i was just a kid back then but i guess it's just	3879	A
the people back in America just were hearing about it how it was just such a disaster this is like the last thing he need is is for Marty to have a heart attack i mean you'll you'll love it i mean it's it's really great um	3879	A
<silence>	3879	A
	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
oh boy that's a good question i haven't figured that one out yet	3857	B
personally i'm thinking of making a goulash	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
but i'm publishing a cookbook right now so or getting it ready to go to the publisher	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
all types	3857	B
different nationalities there's going to be a different section for each nationality	3857	B
it ranges anywhere from Midwestern cooking to Japanese	3857	B
there's some Scottish- there's some Scottish in it some Scottish dishes that i know some Russian some for babies you know how to make baby food instead of buying it because it's so bloody expensive	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
i'm a housewife	3857	B
i'm a housewife	3857	B
everyday too	3857	B
i've got two little boys	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
	3857	B
yeah i made banana bread two days ago and it's gone	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
everything i make disappears real quick so i guess people like it	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
	3857	B
	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
yeah well see a lot of people do live by cookbooks not just house husbands but like bachelors and stuff they don't know how to cook anything you know unless they have a recipe to follow	3857	B
that's why i'm publishing this cookbook because it's simple recipes	3857	B
it's nothing that's hard	3857	B
it's just everything in it is really simple	3857	B
you are	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
just something for a special occasion	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
oh really	3857	B
that must have made you feel good	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
huh	3857	B
well my husband went to chef school before we got married and he can cook all kinds of fancy dishes and i can because i went to cooking school too but i	3857	B
i favor the Midwestern kind of cooking because i grew up country so that's what i like to	3857	B
well i grew up in Arizona	3857	B
on a ranch- on a ranch and it was a horse ranch and we cooked country style you know i mean you don't peel your potatoes when you cook them in the country you just cut them up and there you go	3857	B
	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
yep	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
well my mom published a cookbook when she was married to my dad which was about ten years ago	3857	B
but um	3857	B
and she published hers so now it's my turn	3857	B
i'm trying my luck	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
anywhere near Alamogordo	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
oh	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
there's some really good food that comes out of there i'll tell you	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
	3857	B
there is none around here that's really Mexican	3857	B
they're all fake	3857	B
you know and when you taste the food you know it	3857	B
there's just a difference	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
oh really	3857	B
<silence>	3857	B
	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
well i live in San Diego and it's right near the border	3857	B
but you'd be surprised how fake the restaurants are out here they	3857	B
knowing how close we are to the border i mean you only have to drive five minutes to get to the border	3857	B
you'd think that there'd be good Mexican cooking here	3857	B
what are you cooking for supper	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
that sounds pretty good	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
what type of food	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
well i'm kind of a house husband and and i cook everyday	3857	A
it's about the only thing that	3857	A
huh	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
and	3857	A
today i made a banana cream pie my wife gets testy if i don't have some sort of dessert in the house	3857	A
	3857	A
yeah sometimes i i make things and they don't work so i kind of throw them_1 away before anybody sees them_1	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
but i'm a i i don't know i live out of cookbooks other than stuff that i've cooked over and over and over	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
sometimes i like to get a hold of a very hard book uh	3857	A
and hard recipes especially some of the French dishes	3857	A
and where i've got to read it reread it and then keep it out while i'm cooking	3857	A
and you know something new not something i'm going to fix every day or something	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
right	3857	A
but i guess i know for like twenty years i my wife and i both been fixing a a chicken dish from the Philippines and	3857	A
it's really really strong with garlic and black pepper and	3857	A
we've always thought nobody would like it	3857	A
and uh	3857	A
we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe	3857	A
yeah and i didn't go easy on anything	3857	A
yeah it's it's delicious it's like when it when it's like birthday time and you say well what do you want to eat we always say Chicken Adobo and	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
it's just it's very pungent thing and and we just didn't think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and i've already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so	3857	A
	3857	A
maybe	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
where did you grow up in the Midwest	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
okay	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
right	3857	A
uh	3857	A
i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks they're they're from Midwest from Iowa from her background	3857	A
because that's where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area	3857	A
so it's especially when we're baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know they've been tried and tested and and everything so	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and	3857	A
uh no we lived up at Los Alamos	3857	A
so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh	3857	A
Santa Fe type dishes and uh	3857	A
that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they uh they expect it	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
we don't even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants around here	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
yeah well	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A
in this part of the world there's you know there's a lot and there's some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so	3857	A
you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe	3857	A
that i'd rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and	3857	A
<silence>	3857	A

<silence>	3850	B
i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too but i like i like both of them_1	3850	B
<silence>	3850	B
really	3850	B
<silence>	3850	B
no it's	3850	B

it's not really like a soap opera but	3850	B
but it's	3850	B
<silence>	3850	B

<silence>	3850	B
he was a movie director and he had that gal killed	3850	B

i didn't like the way it ended though	3850	B
<silence>	3850	B
yeah	3850	B

but it's all over now	3850	B
<silence>	3850	B
	3850	A

<silence>	3850	A

<silence>	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
yeah i've seen uh quite a few of the older ones i haven't seen really the new generation that much	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
is there one you prefer better the older one or the younger- the newer one	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
oh yeah	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
yeah i do too i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones	3850	A
a lot i mean he almost hates the new ones yeah because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but	3850	A
whatever	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
oh i think yeah	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
yeah sure	3850	A
well let's see	3850	A
um	3850	A
i like to watch Colombo because it's like a mystery thing	3850	A
and that's sort of how Matlock is but Colombo is	3850	A
	3850	A
uh did you see the one	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
um did-	3850	A
	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
um yeah there's like one on well we see it Thursdays at seven	3850	A
and	3850	A
it was this last time it was about this um movie director	3850	A
did you happen- did you see that one	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
really oh i guess i've never-	3850	A
huh	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
yeah	3850	A
yeah on the set or something	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
yeah it was	3850	A
but i yeah i like Colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
but um there's no never anything good on Saturdays though	3850	A
i don't think so well Star Trek's on at five but i'm never home	3850	A
so	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
oh	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
i've heard of it a lot i've heard of a lot of	3850	A
people somehow or something they'll say so and so from Twin Peaks or something you know	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
 oh	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
oh did they end the whole series	3850	A
oh	3850	A
<silence>	3850	A
oh	3850	A
oh another show i like to watch is MASH	3850	A
	3862	A
hello	3862	A
hi my name is Dolphene i live in Texas	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
okay i work for TI do do you also okay	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
oh okay uh you're ready to begin	3862	A
 oh okay	3862	A
	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
okay	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
 yes	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
well i don't think that uh any of my relatives would really like to go there	3862	A
i- i believe that if i am in a position uh like when my mother	3862	A
gets to the- to a point where she needs special care that i'll be able to	3862	A
just bring her into my home	3862	A
and my father also and um	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
or have someone go into their home you know and um and look after them	3862	A
that way	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
you right it's it's basically it's more how they feel about it because_1 it's like they have feel they feel like they're they're um	3862	A
my- the way my mother would put it like somebody had {throwed} them_1 away you know	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
right	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
um-hum and another- another thing to think about um on the positive side of the nursing homes there	3862	A
i used to work uh in one of the offices in a nursing home and i got to see a lot of the things that that they did	3862	A
they um they had a lot of crafts	3862	A
and they had a lot of games	3862	A
and uh they get together and they just do they they do all sorts of things and then there's some of- some of the uh	3862	A
the people that are that are in there	3862	A
are real nice- you know very very nice and friendly to everybody	3862	A
and uh then there are others that are it's a just just a job and they just you know wanna go in and do what they have to do and get out and go home um	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
 the the attitude of the staff as you said is- is is really uh very very important	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
right	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
right	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
 yeah	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
um yeah	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
well it's like well- the one that i worked in um you would see some of them_1 uh just	3862	A
<silence>	3862	A
like in wheelchairs all day they'd just roll- roll themselves around all over the place and	3862	A
and they would enjoy themselves with activities and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group and they they just	3862	A
didn't like participate together with the others because they they had some some uh	3862	A
i guess slight- a slight mental disabilities and things like um what what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that they just don't don't um	3862	A
they weren't really together with the rest of them_1 when they got together for such activities	3862	A
	3862	B
hello	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
hi my name is Pat Johnson and i live in Texas too	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
 no	3862	B
no i live in Dallas i work for the Dallas school system	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
we might as well	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
understand we're doing care of the elderly right	3862	B
and how do you feel about putting someone in a nursing home	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yes i would find it very difficult uh to place	3862	B
either- my father or my stepmother	3862	B
ah in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yes	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
 yes i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you're faced with placing someone	3862	B
um in a place like that uh you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that's offered and such but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference	3862	B
and i have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and- have no family who could care- you know care for her	3862	B
and uh i know that uh the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about uh her situation	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yes	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yeah	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
i think it would matter too uh the kinds of uh	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
disabilities	3862	B
that	3862	B
the nursing home accepts	3862	B
because there are some uh	3862	B
who poor things you know don't have uh any real grasp on reality any longer	3862	B
and they may be ambulatory but they tend to behave like children small children	3862	B
and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to have- to have to deal with on a daily basis	3862	B
ooh	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yes	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
um-hum um-hum	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yes	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yeah Alzheimer's yes	3862	B
<silence>	3862	B
yes and that can	3862	B
	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
well you know it depends upon our weather here you know today was a beautiful day it was like uh uh summer day it was seventy degrees so	3883	B
so i dressed in um uh a light weight skirt it's a uh ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan	3883	B
over it because i had some appointments at the office today some interviews and so i had to dress up anyway and then i wore heels you know	3883	B
but when it rains a lot which it has been doing here a lot lately uh very often you know wear uh pants and boots	3883	B
you know so how do you dress	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
okay	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
um-hum	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
yeah i can- i can see i i've been a teacher so has my daughter and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring	3883	B
that's right	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
that's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids right	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
yeah i do too so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades uh older grades i had to wear heels	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
um-hum	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
well of course we wear uh an unlined boot you know it it has a heel on it that's the kind of boots that i wear to work	3883	B
and we wear them_1 you know they're a leather boot that you wear as i said they have a regular heel on them high heel	3883	B
and they wear them_1 we wear them a lot with shirts and things	3883	B
	3883	B
in Texas that you wear these boots they're not a cowboy boot but they're just a real pretty boot but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain	3883	B
as i have a private high school that i run here and so when i'm interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels	3883	B
you know and look like i'm a business person you know	3883	B
because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often you know	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
of course you probably wear coats a lot	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
oh my goodness so then you had to	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
yes then things improved right	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
 but of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot	3883	B
you know you know and uh that's very seldom we it depends upon our winter we have a few days you might wear a coat winter coat	3883	B
you know but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much we often laugh about even when it turns chilly we're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
it's really different let's put it that way are you not teaching anymore	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
i see	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
oh so you don't wear heels anymore i'll bet	3883	B
yeah uh-huh	3883	B
more practical	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
when- when you were teaching did you ever have uh uh a blue jean day or anything like that	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
 yeah yeah well i know that in some of the schools they have uh	3883	B
country western day or something like that when you know or tacky day and i always thought it was kind of out of	3883	B
got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too	3883	B
 it's all right for the students they look tacky a lot but i didn't think teachers should you know	3883	B
yeah uh do you like uh uh Iowa	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
where did you live before	3883	B
<silence>	3883	B
oh well that's quite a change from California to Utah	3883	B
<silence>	3883	A
-okay	3883	A
so how'd you just figure	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
wow	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
oh huh uh	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
well um	3883	A
	3883	A
i'm going to talk about when i was working as a teacher and when i was um what i'm what i'm doing now um when i was a teacher um in Utah	3883	A
i would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that and	3883	A
even when it um rained and snowed i just braved it and i wore heels anyways because_1 and	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
oh oh yeah well i need all the height i can get	3883	A
	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
oh yeah	3883	A
uh-huh yeah me too um if it was really- it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots but then i would change um into heels as soon as i got to my desk so um	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
oh	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
oh	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A

<silence>	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
yeah	3883	A
oh huh	3883	A
oh well um	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A
yeah um	3883	A
the first two years i was in a room where they didn't heat it	3883	A
 so i did	3883	A

yeah if it doesn't matter if i have to wash it a hundred times or something	3883	A
<silence>	3883	A

well that'll be nice- yeah that'll be nice yeah we're gonna have a little few people over to watch the game you know just serve hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that so we won't have to miss out on anything	3814	A
	3814	A
so	3814	A
<silence>	3814	A
i know it's too late huh	3814	A
<silence>	3814	A
yeah i was wondering for sure what time it started i thought it was three or something but you say it's four out here huh	3814	A
six o'clock your time huh that's terrible	3814	A
<silence>	3814	A
yeah yeah yeah	3814	A
well	3814	A
<silence>	3814	A
yeah um okay then it's been nice talking to you Brad all right bye-bye	3814	A
	3814	A
 so uh	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
uh Cowboy fan die hard	3814	B
yeah ever since i was last sixteen seventeen years well- as long as i can remember yeah ever since seventy six but um yeah big time they are uh	3814	B
everyone's jumping on the bandwagon now after the season they had what part of Patterson	3814	B
 and- that uh that California is that	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
oh okay so you're up-	3814	B
okay	3814	B
	3814	B
so i guess you're uh	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
there you go there you go	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah but if they would've made- to the play-offs i mean they were they were the hottest team i thought at the end of the season it's just it's kind of	3814	B
it's kind of bad that they miss out on the play-offs with a tie breaker or whatever but	3814	B
 that	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
uh i think it's um Buffalo	3814	B
i- i really do i think it's their time to	3814	B
everyone's picking Washington but	3814	B
i don't know i mean i think the AFC's been getting beat up every year you know lost a few Super Bowls	3814	B
because_1 they went last year they should have won it and you know missed that kick but	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah pretty bad for the kicker but	3814	B
 i think they'll do it i mean naturally Redskins	3814	B
and the Cowboys don't have a	3814	B
much like for each other but um	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah it's	3814	B
the- the way they went out that- didn't go over and it got killed by Detroit but they're young team i mean they got all those draft picks next year i mean their future's	3814	B
i mean they're one of the young i mean they got so many stars and with Jimmy Johnson i mean you never know what he's gonna do it's just that guy's a wizard drafting people	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
i went to four games this year actually um	3814	B
friends of mine have season tickets we've always- it's always um each year we've taken turns in getting them_1 and kind of	3814	B
switched around on them_1 everything and i just graduated and i moved back so i got to see more games finally	3814	B
i went to school at Texas Tech out in Lubbock Texas for last four years so i saw the games on TV but i hadn't been to any since yeah Thanksgiving once i guess	3814	B
so you make any- many 49er games	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah i guess it- still want them_1 back in Oakland huh	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah i guess there's not many Al Davis fans out there	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
uh you got just- so many	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah there's so many teams out in California though i mean that's what the Rams the Raiders the	3814	B
uh uh that's just	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
 yeah um going Super Bowl party actually so um	3814	B
 i'll be out there for do it every year how about_1 y'all	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
right	3814	B
and there you go	3814	B
yeah i- i just wish it would start a little bit earlier because i guess well out there it starts at four but starts at six here you know that's	3814	B
i don't i mean people you know that they're wondering why their ratings go down every year it's because_1 people get don't like to	3814	B
yeah i mean but- a time because_1 lot of people you know they got to work the next day they don't wanna be sitting around at nine or ten at night and	3814	B
you know they start taking off but	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
yeah it's six- it's six o'clock here like six eighteen so it'll be	3814	B
 but it's one good thing about living out there daylight everything	3814	B
but um	3814	B
well i guess that ought to do it	3814	B
<silence>	3814	B
okay yeah all right thank you later bye	3814	B
	3814	B
 how many children do you have	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
	3806	A
um okay	3806	A
we've got one he's uh thirteen weeks yesterday	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
oh okay	3806	A
from Beijing	3806	A
oh okay	3806	A
pardon	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
it's not not real toasty here either but i imagine it's a good deal colder in Iowa	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
	3806	A
	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
is that where you're from originally	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
	3806	A
okay	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
uh yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
right now uh our son's just uh dealing with grunts and squeaks and grinning and crying and	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
	3806	A
actually no he sleeps real well at night	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
he'll he he generally sleeps through the night uh he'll go down about till- well he don't doesn't go down till about ten ten thirty which is a little tough when you got a lot of studying to do but uh	3806	A
he'll uh he won't get up till like six o'clock uh somewhere between six and eight in the morning	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
he'll be ravenously hungry by then	3806	A
but he's truly a jolly little fellow and sleeps through the night too which is a real blessing	3806	A
uh it- it took about the first four weeks before he started that	3806	A
which i don't think it was quite coincidental but he started sleeping through the night about the time we took him out of our bed and put him in a crib in in the next room	3806	A
suddenly he started sleeping through the night almost consistently	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah that's good	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
that's good	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
pardon	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
um-hum	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
that's got to be a a lot of fun	3806	A
	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah uh uh it's you know	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah well they they the children are gonna to eventually training- wind up training themselves but	3806	A
um they can be trained into it pretty early too	3806	A
so i remember some of the strange potty training experiences when i we were growing up amongst brothers and sisters	3806	A
so	3806	A
and we're almost kind of not looking forward to that	3806	A
	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
anyway	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
um	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah that's good	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
<silence>	3806	A
	3806	B
um i have one child a little girl who's eighteen months old	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
oh wow congratulations	3806	B
um	3806	B
actually even though our daughter is a year and a half we just got her last July we adopted a little girl from Beijing	3806	B
uh yeah my wife is also Chinese	3806	B
my my wife is Chinese	3806	B
and so we um traveled to Beijing and we adopted her and so we're	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
she's just at a playful age right now we just do a lot of things play with her and take her to a park of course can't- right now it's too cold to go out too much here it's been really cold	3806	B
but um	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
yeah uh although we were gone for most of our Christmas and we had a nice time in in California for our vacation visiting family	3806	B
so	3806	B
um yeah	3806	B
no that's where my wife's from and we also visited Seattle where i'm from	3806	B
and	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
so	3806	B
we just love- mainly we we like to spend time playing games and	3806	B
um	3806	B
just she's sort of at a playful age teaching her new words things like that	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
yeah so yeah your your activities probably consist of staying up at night um	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
really	3806	B
-that's good	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
oh that's nice	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
well we found that was important too for sleeping through the night um having um their their own room	3806	B
in fact it was almost trained out of our daughter during vacation where at our parents' house where it's just um one room for all of us our daughter and us um	3806	B
the first few nights back she was terrified to be in the room by herself but now she's	3806	B
sleeping through the night again so	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
um we	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
my wife um	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
is we also- other things we're trying- trying to do um um	3806	B
is potty train our our girl a year and a half that's a little some people think that's a little bit early but um	3806	B
she was the foster parents our friends in China who had taken care of her before we could get her um	3806	B
have a Chinese generally potty train their children a little bit earlier earlier and um	3806	B
so um we're having spend some time with that also	3806	B
but	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
and	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
yeah well i'd	3806	B
she doesn't enjoy it that much but um she's learning slowly but surely	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
we have a little book it talks about giving rewards and so it's a pleasant experience and things like that	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
<silence>	3806	B
yeah but there's a lot of we we're just having lots of fun with with our little girl right now um she has lots of toys got little	3806	B
she especially likes the little telephone and the little tyke bike that she has	3806	B
um and then reading she likes us to to go through the books you know and she could say a few word you know she could learning to say the names of you know a lot of simple animals and um	3806	B
and the you know the sounds that they make	3806	B
	3806	B
like duck says quack	3806	B
and doggy says ruff things like that	3806	B
so that's about her	3806	B
her stage right now and she's running around she she started	3806	B
when we first adopted her we she she wasn't walking yet but she was soon walking within a couple weeks after that and now she's running all	3806	B
 hi what do you think about gun control	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or	3803	A
um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in DC come home very quickly	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
well i'm not so sure about that but i think somehow uh safety courses	3803	A
or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people	3803	A
i'd like to know that the people who had them_1 at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them_1 or not you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better	3803	A
which is sort of you know flaky but still	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
yeah i don't know this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns	3803	A
and went up to New York and sold them_1 for you know very high markups now in a sense that's a legal	3803	A
way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
right	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
right and i suppose complete- uh you know complete- total ban would lead to more illegal weapons	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
um-hum um-hum	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
right	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
but that's true i mean some people grew up with guns in the house we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing	3803	A
and i'm not sure that's good either	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
<silence>	3803	A
	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i side- i lean more towards the control side than than towards	3803	B
you know just the the free free arming um on the other hand i it's it's sort of an issue of of uh	3803	B
uh i'm not i'm not a great fan of of government control in general and so it's it's kind of a tough issue what about yourself	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
um-hum	3803	B
	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
i'm i'm sure yeah um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um	3803	B
 specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that is that	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
	3803	B
huh	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
 yeah i i have i- i have the impression that that the	3803	B
the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are- are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway	3803	B
um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents' gun or something and and	3803	B
shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's that's certainly within the channels right	3803	B
but um	3803	B
a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
uh-huh	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
yeah	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
uh-huh yeah i i mean i think uh some states- or i i i don't know if anybody actually has implemented i think so um at least there's been talk about doing uh	3803	B
you know like waiting periods and and things like that um and and uh	3803	B
you know i i think stuff like that is perfectly good i mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything strange- you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes	3803	B
waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem you know and and things i don't know i've	3803	B
 you know i uh i don't own a gun and and don't really want one and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did um but on the other hand you	3803	B
know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general uh	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they're not gonna disappear anytime soon um and they're already	3803	B
i know there's a ready market for them_1 you know in the stolen- the stolen stolen guns can be sold i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun	3803	B
right because uh because they they can be so easily sold	3803	B
and you know their their i don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but um it's not like they're gonna disappear all of a sudden	3803	B
um even if you do do a total ban on them_1	3803	B
uh-huh it's a real tough problem	3803	B
i i don't know i don't know where i	3803	B
really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue i think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing right	3803	B
you know and	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
uh-huh	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
hm	3803	B
yeah well we you know we i grew up with them_1 i never really took to hunting i mean i did some of it but uh	3803	B
you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that	3803	B
and you know it was a whole different thing and and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses	3803	B
<silence>	3803	B
 but it you know that's that seems to me just to be a whole another issue um you know the the thing that the i yeah i'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people	3803	B
	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
well it usually just means sort of getting away from the normal	3867	B
uh time spent at uh day to day job in the office and trying to enjoy the outdoors for the most part	3867	B
um i haven't done as much as i use to but i- i still like to go once and a while and go camping	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
right	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
 the long ones	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
right	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
my son- my son has recently joined boy scouts and i i've become fairly active with them and and uh	3867	B
he joined about four months ago and we've gone on about three uh camp outs since then uh	3867	B
two of which involved uh back packing and and hiking they're a pretty active troop and i've i've enjoyed it it's gotten me a chance to get back out and do a little bit more again	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yes uh	3867	B
we uh my family uh and i we lived in Colorado up until about three years ago for about fourteen years and and of course that was a great	3867	B
uh state for camping uh to get up in the mountains and it was easy to go some place on a weekend it's it's a little more difficult for me now living in Texas just because there is so much	3867	B
private land in Texas and there is not too much in the way of national forests and state lands that you can go hiking on here as opposed to states in the west i don't know how the Iowa area is for for that	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
you can really- yeah really get out and hike uh-huh	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
oh yeah uh-huh	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yeah well camping- camping i guess uh different people look at it in different in different ways and and do different activities whether it's canoeing or	3867	B
	3867	B
camping can still be enjoyable	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yes the two burner stove	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
right	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
we we've evolved to the stage of uh uh pop up tent camper camping now now that my our kids have gotten a little bit uh uh	3867	B
involved with camping and my wife finally got tired of camping in tents and having to bail out the water during rain storms and so forth so she talked me into getting a pop up camper and so	3867	B
our camping is sometimes a little more leisurely now than it use to be a little more	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yes uh-huh	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yeah it's it's somewhere in between camping and going to uh a motel i guess	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
yeah uh-huh	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
my- my son's boy scout troop does an annual uh one week float on the Buffalo River in Arkansas and i am trying to make sure he gets his qualifications in by next spring because_1 i would like to go on the trip with them_1 because_1 they	3867	B
camp out for seven or eight days while on the Buffalo River and they're floating floating for that many days and i am looking forward that would be uh roughing it more than i have in a long time	3867	B
<silence>	3867	B
<silence>	3867	A
um	3867	A
Tom what does camping mean to you	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
uh-huh	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
um-hum well when i think about camping is uh	3867	A
well back from my boy scout days uh usually means hiking out in the mountains and and uh building your own camp fire bringing your own food in a pack um and	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
and things like that um things that i associate with camping usually	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
the hikes and camping that we do we	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
go to a lake and it might even involve some canoeing and	3867	A
and then we might	3867	A
i remember especially the fifty mile hikes where we'd we'd hike from lake to lake you know one day we'd be at one lake and hike to another lake they might be about five or ten miles away the next day and	3867	A
and things like that	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
uh-huh	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
well i haven't done	3867	A
much recently that's just what comes to mind when i think of camping that is what i think of and was what i did when i was a boy scout um	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
well i just picture myself and i was going to say i really don't know what's available here i know there's some lakes we could drive to but i don't know of any places where	3867	A
you know you can do hiking and stuff like that	3867	A
i grew up um in the Seattle area and the Cascade Mountains were just an hours drive away and that	3867	A
that's where we did a lot of our hiking and camping um and then i lived	3867	A
while i was going to school at the University i was in Utah and there is also you know mountains there where you can	3867	A
do hiking and- plenty of hiking and camping	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
yeah	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
yeah i know for my from my mom um camping is um	3867	A
definitely bringing the Coleman stove and	3867	A
uh-huh even if we do build a campfire along side um the cooking is done on the Coleman stove just because_1 more convenient	3867	A
although even when my family and i went camping when we were growing up uh we went in the tents always you know	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
oh in the camper oh that would that is if what makes it a little more luxurious	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
well i guess the main point is to get to um enjoy the outdoors and	3867	A
you know especially if you go near a lake or mountains or you know beautiful scenery you know	3867	A
<silence>	3867	A
that	3867	A
 -okay i pushed it	3847	A
so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
uh-huh	3847	A
	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
yeah right	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3847	A
well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything but um our water supply right now is bad we need rain badly	3847	A
 uh we can water here and Patterson i can water on Tuesdays Thursdays	3847	A
Saturday and Sunday four days a week	3847	A
so	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
it was this last summer yeah	3847	A
uh now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know	3847	A
but um yeah we do our lawn- our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i	3847	A
do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers	3847	A
and uh	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
oh	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
yeah	3847	A
yeah we have quite a few roses i just uh we in fact we just pruned them_1 uh way down and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them_1 so i just bought that yesterday and uh probably go outside today and plant that	3847	A
but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long	3847	A
i even had uh roses on my table for Christmas dinner	3847	A
which was really pretty you know but um other than the roses i don't have too many flowers i plant gladiolas	3847	A
and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they they bend over so fast	3847	A
you know	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum well is it that one of those Amaryllis	3847	A
no huh	3847	A
oh okay	3847	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3847	A
do you have a big yard	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
yeah right right	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
um	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum well that makes it nice	3847	A
well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool but we don't have one	3847	A
you know but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have	3847	A
	3847	A
so we do have a garden you know	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
it's just a small one you know but we had a lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini	3847	A
uh it's amazing- it's amazing what you can get out of a little	3847	A
you know it's probably about twenty by	3847	A
i don't know	3847	A
twenty by six something like that and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there	3847	A
but it was nice a few cucumbers	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
<silence>	3847	A
	3847	B
okay	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
uh no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's	3847	B
really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas i used to live in Arizona and it was very confusing- very frustrating because_1 i didn't have the	3847	B
watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough water automatically- you know naturally as well as have the automatic sprinklers and so it's a lot more rewarding	3847	B
so	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
oh that's right	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
um-hum is is that enough during the hotter times of the year	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah i- i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and-	3847	B
and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they'd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would	3847	B
come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting	3847	B
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so	3847	B
um i'm gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that	3847	B
you know feels	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
yeah those are enjoyable	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
oh did you	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
um those are nice	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
yeah yeah i haven't done much in in bulbs in fact i received as a Christmas present a a	3847	B
a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and	3847	B
	3847	B
it's just nice and green right now	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
uh no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a paper- white paper flower or something	3847	B
and uh so i don't know	3847	B
no not really and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we had some	3847	B
some play yard last over but it's	3847	B
it's um you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's that's about the size of most of them_1	3847	B
	3847	B
and	3847	B
yeah	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
uh yeah	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
yeah	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
oh do you	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
oh	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
<silence>	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
that's one part of gardening i haven't tried yet and i don't think this yard is a very	3847	B
 our topic today	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
right and now i'm sort of don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage my wife's a school teacher so	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
 no you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too my wife teaches seventh grade	3841	A
and you know	3841	A
there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but uh	3841	A
for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs and course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even even in the seventh grade	3841	A
Plano School System but but to give you an example uh	3841	A
you know one of her kids will come in and he's	3841	A
you could tell he's just bombed out on drugs and uh she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it	3841	A
you're not allowed to send them_1 home you know if you do that then	3841	A
your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and just it's it's a numbers game i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and	3841	A
preventing other kids from learning	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
yes	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
sure	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
sure	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
oh yeah my son had such a tough time in uh	3841	A
the school he went to but there was through it wasn't all the school's fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in Richardson and that that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was	3841	A
but uh had to be done at least it	3841	A
took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something	3841	A
	3841	A
but i'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
yeah i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
you bet	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
you bet	3841	A
well- it's different-	3841	A
<silence>	3841	A
sure well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just	3841	A
are always fighting the system i don't know if it's better than any you know we came down to Texas from the uh New York area we were only there for a short time but my wife is from New York and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and	3841	A
i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from and they they i don't know if they learn more but they certainly uh	3841	A
they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities	3841	A
	3841	B
uh yeah something about the school system here	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
well then i'll uh i'll walk softly	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
yeah	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
what school system does she teach in	3841	B
oh wow	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
well i think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than uh	3841	B
than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program	3841	B
um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school	3841	B
because they've taken it the best teachers and the best students they've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district	3841	B
and uh put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult but once you're in uh they have they have self-paced programs	3841	B
and so you have students that wanna learn and uh you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically uh	3841	B
 there's probably some discrimination if you wanna say that uh because most of the people that are in the academy system	3841	B
uh are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system	3841	B
and most of that's not all true but i'm saying a large percentage of them_1 are and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does	3841	B
and so there's i think that uh that's my justification for saying that	3841	B
the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it	3841	B
don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
 yeah	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
yeah i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the South Dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education	3841	B
level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education	3841	B
uh including uh	3841	B
exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do	3841	B
uh database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can't function	3841	B
you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you	3841	B
unless you have the education and then education- and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself	3841	B
<silence>	3841	B
	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
uh well i guess we're not as bad as a lot of places but uh we're out here on the Great Plains so there's some place for it to go	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
yeah	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
yeah i've heard that	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
um-hum	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
yeah i think that's probably the problem with any of the coastal cities i think that's what New York has such a problem with	3888	B
you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
i don't think it's as bad yeah	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
i know there's some because in my visits to New York i noticed that my i wear i'm a contact lens wearer and i noticed that i have to uh take out my contacts	3888	B
yeah i can't wear them_1 as many hours during the day as i can other places but you know i mean that's not just New York i mean that's also Europe you know Rome is the worst city i've ever been at	3888	B
course now i hear that uh you now like Mexico City is real bad for that	3888	B
and also places in Brazil like Sao Paulo you know	3888	B
yeah	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever	3888	B
so whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we have they just like fire away you know	3888	B
they control nothing i mean it's like it's like you know the situation- it you know Brazil even though there's there's in Brazil uh it- it's my understanding because i have some friends there that are Brazilian	3888	B
uh there's an upper-class and a lower-class and no middle-class	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
and so you know the lower class is working uh in the factories which pollute the air and the upper classes make the money off of the factories	3888	B
and so pollution is a big problem for all of the you know underdeveloped countries because_1 they're not going to they're not going to start instituting regulations that are going to impede their whatever industry they happen to have	3888	B
which you know that's kind of going to be the end result you know Bush- i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory	3888	B
uh things right now that are going to impede business the first effect that it has had is the EPA had some new regs up	3888	B
for um congressional approval that had to do with making industries uh itemize uh different types of things that they were you know	3888	B
putting into the air you know part of the clean air act you know which is to help enforce the clean air act and so that of course you know the moratorium on new regulations has you know hamstrung that	3888	B
<silence>	3888	B
absolutely not	3888	B
not any profit driven industry because you know they're just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything that's going to take away from profits i mean we're we're living in the greed generation here i mean there is no there is	3888	B
sure i mean you know	3888	B
i mean i've heard- i've heard that before and i'm now beginning to believe it because	3888	B
you know what i mean i have some limited involvement in some in some what you would call i guess environmental type entities i'm an attorney and i write letters for a number of environmental um	3888	B
uh purposes and you know it it is amazing to me that people can sit here and look at the situation that we have globally and say you know what the hell	3888	B
because uh you know it's it's really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry you know are going away	3888	B
	3888	A
well how polluted do you think we are down here	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
i think so	3888	A
uh-huh	3888	A
yeah i guess so and it's still a little bit flat around here and there's no specific mountains to hem it in	3888	A
uh we used to live in California and although we were not in the smoggy area of Los Angeles we used to visit down there and honestly you could	3888	A
you could you could see the smog hanging over the city it's just about uh	3888	A
yes we can and a friend of mine lives out in San Bernardino	3888	A
and uh uh just beyond San Bernardino	3888	A
is the desert and separating San Bernardino from the desert are some mountain ranges and when the smog gets very very bad in Los Angeles it moves out there and then is bounded	3888	A
	3888	A
it's a very very strange thing	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
yeah although you know	3888	A
um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
yeah	3888	A
	3888	A
i- i do think that's what's one of the real problems although i grew up in New York and i never noticed this kind of pollution as i- i saw in uh you know southern California	3888	A
and then um-hum	3888	A
 yes um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
oh	3888	A
clean them	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
uh oh	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
uh	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
oh uh-huh	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
oh i see well i've never been down there	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
is that right well what are they doing down there that causes such a thing what kind of industries do they have	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
i see	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
i see um	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
oh i see um-hum um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum um	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
oh i see uh-huh um	3888	A
um	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
profits i guess	3888	A
um-hum yeah uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A

um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
right	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
that's right uh-huh i- i know that	3888	A
a lot of the European countries and Mexico and the South American countries simply do not have the governmental regulations and i think that unless the government is uh	3888	A
on top of this or at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going to be done by private industry until they you know get that push it really wasn't done in our country	3888	A
 you know um um-hum yeah uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
uh-huh the greed generation oh what a terrible thing to say uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
oh i see	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
 oh i know um um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um	3888	A
<silence>	3888	A
oh	3888	A
	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
no i don't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer	3801	B
uh	3801	B
uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something's happens on Mockingbird	3801	B
and then heard yells and screams and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house	3801	B
and they had stopped a uh a stolen car	3801	B
and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back	3801	B
by- on my house	3801	B
	3801	B
 so i'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
it was	3801	B
i uh i kept hearing noises and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage so i got a gun- my gun	3801	B
and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure	3801	B
	3801	B
is Plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area	3801	B
that's too bad	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
um-hum um-hum	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
well i was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen Plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
yeah	3801	B
well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
uh well it's further west of me	3801	B
i live over near White Rock Lake	3801	B
but uh uh it was really frightening to think that uh it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth uh i never thought about someone robbing those	3801	B
but apparently they do	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
yeah it just doesn't seem possible does it	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
no	3801	B
yeah	3801	B
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
it it is convenient isn't it i didn't know what i was doing	3801	B
that kind of	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
well yes and i work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System and uh uh uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
uh no this is over near Lincoln High School	3801	B
uh just not far off South Central Expressway	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
it is a pretty rough area we're over by Fair Park	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
and uh	3801	B
you know you watch the people there are marvelous BMW's and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns	3801	B
and the kids see that and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
it surely is	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
 well i'm careful	3801	B
<silence>	3801	B
yeah it's uh a little scary sometimes and uh i manage the	3801	B
	3801	A
well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone you're in	3801	A
	3801	A
i'm afraid you're right	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
oh my	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
oh boy	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
by your house	3801	A
oh my goodness ah aye aye	3801	A
	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
oh my that's that's got to be a frightening way to spend- spend an evening	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
oh boy	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
unfortunately yes yes	3801	A
i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get	3801	A
the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there and i think uh	3801	A
you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek but uh we've been we've lived here sixteen years and	3801	A
now you you know you -can tell the change for sure	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
yes	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
well with all the uh	3801	A
Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the	3801	A
uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by you know and	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
that's that couldn't be too far from you neither uh	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
okay_1	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
oh yes okay	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
it's kind of	3801	A
kind of stupid isn't it	3801	A
but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
right	3801	A
right right just like the old alcohol idea and	3801	A
i think people uh	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are	3801	A
too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
oh boy where do you work	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
uh yes i think i do that uh	3801	A
is that Amelia Earhart -Earhart School there	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
okay	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
that's a pretty rough area there isn't it	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
um my goodness	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
huh	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
definitely that area that that's big time big time there sure is	3801	A
i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself in that area	3801	A
gee that's the worst neighborhood in the whole city- area	3801	A
<silence>	3801	A
	3812	B
well we have Bermuda grass here do you have that there	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
it's a kind of grass that dies in the winter time	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
do you live in an apartment or a house	3812	B
so you probably don't do any lawn care	3812	B
	3812	B
	3812	B
and fertilize and such but we ran in some into some money trouble so we do all of that ourselves now does the grass die there in Iowa in the winter time	3812	B
is everything brown	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
so right now we do nothing because_1 it's brown and it doesn't grow until	3812	B
later on in the spring	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
but	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
no huh-uh it just goes dormant and then it starts it's you know it rejuvenates itself in the springtime there are people that uh	3812	B
that reseed in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like that i can't remember exactly what it's called	3812	B
and so it's green in the winter but you have to seed over all of this other stuff that's	3812	B
there and it's kind of hard to grow it's kind of foolish as far as i'm concerned	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
so did you grow up in Iowa	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
oh	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff	3812	B
huh	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
huh	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
huh	3812	B
we have a garden here but in Texas it's really hard to grow a garden because it's so	3812	B
hot and the sun is so intense that you know the	3812	B
	3812	B
to have a garden here	3812	B
did you enjoy it did you like to do it when you were there	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
huh	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah you had a compost pile huh	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
how many how many were in your family	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
was it something that the kids mostly took care of	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
what was your favorite thing	3812	B
to eat	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
uh-huh	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
 you'd think so	3812	B
so what took you to Iowa	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
uh-huh	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
where did you graduate	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
i knew it i'm a member too that's why i was when you were talking about your garden and everything and your mom canning i thought this guy's got to be got to have roots there somewhere	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
no i grew up in California	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
no it was more in the city but we did have a um a little garden out in the back because_1 anything grows there you just stick it in the ground and it it grows	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
<silence>	3812	B
yeah do you have in- in your apartment-	3812	B
<silence>	3812	A
so Cathy what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
um i don't know exactly what that is	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
um i don't	3812	A
	3812	A
yeah i live in an apartment	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
yeah that's that's actually correct	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
um it turns brown yeah	3812	A
guess it freezes and everything so	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
so does that mean you have to replant each year or	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
i see	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
no i'm actually from uh	3812	A
uh the Seattle area we lived outside outside of the city- in the country and uh we have five acres of land up against a hillside where i grew up and so we did have a garden about a one a half acre garden pretty big size	3812	A
and grew standard things like corn beans and we had some trees apple trees fruit trees you know and apple trees and	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
oh yeah	3812	A
did lots of canning and	3812	A
we even	3812	A
made an annual trip out to eastern Washington	3812	A
Yakima area to get uh	3812	A
 peaches and things like that to can in addition to the the fruit we got out of our own garden	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
uh-huh	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
oh yeah i enjoyed um	3812	A
working in the garden	3812	A
um	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
my dad was a big um	3812	A
fan of organic gardening	3812	A
and so when we um did our garbage and stuff we separated all the banana peels and egg shells and stuff that	3812	A
yeah	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
yeah and	3812	A
always picked a different place in the garden to dump it out	3812	A
had our own rototiller and	3812	A
rough even though it was a large plot we used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was quite a bit of work for all of us but we five kids and	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
uh	3812	A
six kids altogether	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
actually dad did more than his share but uh we always had our our assignments to help out	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
so and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the canning and other things	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
um oh to eat oh um	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
the our big crops were were	3812	A
green beans and corn and i guess i liked the corn	3812	A
and so now that i'm in Iowa i should be get be able to get lots of uh	3812	A
corn on the cob huh	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
uh	3812	A
i just graduated-	3812	A
i	3812	A
i'm working at the University of Iowa	3812	A
um on a post doctoral fellowship i just graduated	3812	A
out west with a PhD in physics	3812	A
uh Brigham Young University	3812	A
uh	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
uh	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
yes and uh	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
so are you originally from Texas	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
i see	3812	A
did- did your family have a farm or were you more in the city	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
uh-huh	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
oh yeah	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
yeah my wife is from southern California and their family has a an orange tree and a lemon tree out back	3812	A
and they grow a few things they tried- tomatoes and stuff but not they don't have very you know just a small- small backyard so there's not too much else they could do there	3812	A
<silence>	3812	A
	3872	A
	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
it's on the the time that we spend with our children	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
okay	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
uh we just uh well we have the one that uh has left	3872	A
but he was here a year ago and uh he was involved in wrestling- wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is uh	3872	A
he's a doctor and he was uh All State in wrestling	3872	A
and then uh my last son that just left home is All State in wrestling so we had two in our family but we had a lot of participation with them_1 and i know what you're talking about where you it's difficult to find time but i	3872	A
i- i feel it's very important that you support the kids as much as you can you and uh uh the spouse because uh when uh well both sons uh when they were wrestling uh they would kind of look up	3872	A
to see if we were in the audience and the that's the last they pay any attention to us -until after the game is over right and the wrestling match	3872	A
and uh we really enjoyed it uh to be involved with our our uh children and i think it's very important that's something that	3872	A
the parents today and- and- and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with with church and everything else that you're doing	3872	A
but uh that's where a family relationship is really built and uh it's uh then they have	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
uh-huh	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
well super	3872	A
well those are things that they'll they'll never forget and uh they know they're loved when when that takes place	3872	A
and that you're supporting them there are so many families that i know about today that they just don't take uh time to do anything with their children	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
oh good good well we're gonna try to get down to uh hopefully for his uh uh the oldest one's uh	3872	A
baptism and then the grandson's uh our youngest to get his uh to the blessing but i don't know whether we can make it or not we're gonna give it a shot but that's coming up	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
i appreciate that he was a super son and when he was wrestling uh we had two sons wrestling and we one week we went to twelve wrestling matches in one week	3872	A
	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
 oh he he's very talented in all kinds of things uh he's not like his dad he can do about anything and uh we really miss him being in in Texas	3872	A
so anyway	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
um-hum well that's super	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
um-hum yep well be sure and tell Brian hello and it's been a pleasure talking to you sounds like our time's up and uh give him the the best from him his dad	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
oh oh i see okay	3872	A
i've i've this the first call so i don't know what happens when the time's up	3872	A
oh i see okay fine	3872	A
and course church involvement i think is very important too uh that with parents uh supporting their children in in taking them to Church and going with them_1	3872	A
and that's- that's another activity that uh time is spent and	3872	A
<silence>	3872	A
	3872	A
	3872	B
so okay so what is the subject now	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
okay well let me tell you about our our situation um we have two girls uh one is twelve one is uh	3872	B
is eleven and i've got uh two sons that are um	3872	B
six and three	3872	B
and uh between the four	3872	B
uh my two girls play a lot of soccer and we travel a lot with them	3872	B
and they're either practicing or playing and and it is really tough to fit everything in	3872	B
and uh you know i'm not real sure what your situation is if you you have any kids that are still at home but	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
oh is that right	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
oh	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
 you bet	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
it sure makes a big difference doesn't it	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
it sure is	3872	B
we have uh in fact we- this this past um Christmas	3872	B
we went out to California we- uh both my girls were involved in in tournaments out there so went out there we spent Christmas with uh my wife's family out there in in California and then um	3872	B
we drove out to or down to Southern California and had the tournament we went to Disneyland as a family and and just kind of you know spent time together that way	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
	3872	B
you bet my wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
to be blessed	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
yeah i know that means a you'd mean a lot to uh to Brian he's a he's a heck of a nice guy boy- i really enjoy uh being friends with him he's	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
is that right	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
when did he find time to learn how to do brakes he just helped me do my brakes	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
yeah he is	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
	3872	B
yes	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
well that's great yeah um my work uh uh fortunately my work doesn't take me away from from this area so	3872	B
i have uh i have some time i own my own business out here so i have some time just just spent with them you know whenever the time uh whenever they need me but um	3872	B
i- i know that there's quite a few people in our family that uh or in our you know in our area that um	3872	B
that work outside and and they have a even tougher time trying to uh schedule time with their families	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
okay i'm i'm not sure if our time's up or my phone just went out of out of whack i think that was just my phone	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
well they'll come back on and tell us when the time is up yeah it they should be another couple of minutes so	3872	B
	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
uh-huh oh yeah	3872	B
<silence>	3872	B
well i think that's it that's probably more important than anything else and-	3872	B
<silence>	3830	A
hello how you doing i'm Lee with uh uh i'm over here in Plano Texas	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
oh sure	3830	A
	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
	3830	A
oh	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
 where are you calling from or where are you at	3830	A
Arlington well there's a	3830	A
 lot of	3830	A
stuff going on in Arlington these days	3830	A
are you involved in any of that no	3830	A
 well uh what benefits uh do- now do you work	3830	A
oh you are	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
okay	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
 yeah because_1 i- i work for myself and so uh	3830	A
 uh there's a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come but uh	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
oh is that right	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
yeah i uh i own part of a roofing company	3830	A
in the in the Dallas Fort Worth area	3830	A
and uh you- you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we we had all the benefits there and and i do miss that you know but uh on the other hand i	3830	A
i uh	3830	A
i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and	3830	A
being able to you know work when i want and	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
oh is that right	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
it's a	3830	A
yeah it really- probably- it probably- yeah i'll tell you what that is the single most uh benefit that i that i	3830	A
enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just	3830	A
and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it	3830	A
and uh yeah	3830	A
oh yeah even at a group rate uh it's it's unbelievable and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's	3830	A
that eats even more so yeah i guess what the other benefits that uh	3830	A
 that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the	3830	A
bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know and course these days you can't count on that because	3830	A
uh you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
 GM deal there in in Arlington and i'm i'm sure it'll be you know quite a few people are affected by that so	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
oh really	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
is that right	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
 the Union yeah	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
is that right	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
well really the	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
yeah really the ones it's gonna hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area you know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
oh yeah	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
um-hum	3830	A
<silence>	3830	A
well i tell you i i've had my fill of unions i use-	3830	A
oh yeah-	3830	A
<silence>	3830	B
hello fine	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
okay let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off okay	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
okay	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
Arlington Arlington Texas yes	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
yes not all good stuff	3830	B
no no i'm not not personally	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
 i'm going to school right now i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what i think i've got a lot of	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
yes right	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
yes	3830	B
yes i've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact i'm selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having	3830	B
that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits weren't there so	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
oh do you yeah	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
yeah	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
right	3830	B
yep um-hum	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
i think today the thing that i uh	3830	B
would appreciate the most uh because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine	3830	B
and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured	3830	B
	3830	B
i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to have- you need to have	3830	B
right	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
it's out of sight right it's out of sight	3830	B
even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
right it goes up right	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
um-hum	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B

<silence>	3830	B
right	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the GM people come in when they were they would shut down to retool	3830	B
they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this right- yes	3830	B
they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and	3830	B
every Friday and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these great- i- i really believe they have done this to themselves	3830	B
in a way because of the unions being so strong	3830	B
and right now anybody that's laid off from GM will have a full year's paycheck	3830	B
i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at	3830	B
at uh through the company so i'm sorry- you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check and that would be it	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them_1 in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know	3830	B
and it made the prices of cars go up and	3830	B
and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far	3830	B
<silence>	3830	B
i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour	3830	B
i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour	3830	B
	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
oh really hum	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
oh my gosh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
do do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing	3890	B
huh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
huh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
huh yeah see we're it's they're actually in the University of Texas system and i don't i don't even know anything about them_1 i'm here in Austin we have uh University- UT Austin	3890	B
right which is which i mean- i just generally go to the University of Texas right and	3890	B
the the Longhorns um	3890	B
and uh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
actually- actually i don't know right now Longhorns aren't having quite the year that they had hoped um they they had a a star forward that that was disqualified because of	3890	B
of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they uh some supporter gave him a car or something and uh	3890	B
yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they they're they're holding on but it's not it's not going to be a a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
yeah	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
no it it it something had happened outside of that you know and and it happened as as part of his junior college career	3890	B
but no but they pulled him out of the out of the lineup	3890	B
you know and it was something he he reported himself or i mean they it wasn't a and and the NCAA uh immediately suspended him and then	3890	B
and then actually UT on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so	3890	B
yeah but	3890	B
they've been having uh i mean last- last- last year they had a real good team they had every- they had a new coach Tom Penders come in um about i guess about three years ago	3890	B
and and the the program had been in a long a long decline you know for for years they i guess back when Abe Lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition	3890	B
and then it it kind of went downhill for about_1 for a couple of coaches and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
yeah	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
hum	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
i don't know yeah uh the women's program is quite interesting down here the the women's program here in in Austin um	3890	B
actually for a while it was was drawing bigger crowds than the men's program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean they've they've always been in the top	3890	B
top eight in the country um and actually had a couple of years that they haven't been quite as strong but but uh	3890	B
the the Southwestern Conference uh they've been undefeated in the Southwestern- they were no they aren't now but they had been undefeated in the Southwestern Conference for something like a five year streak or something	3890	B
and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or something-	3890	B
and so -that is they've they've that's that's quite a tradition here in in Texas but	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
oh yeah	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
right	3890	B
<silence>	3890	B
up to speed yeah	3890	B
	3890	A
as Texas El Paso uh they were undefeated until uh Thursday night when they played the University of Utah here in Salt Lake City and uh	3890	A
they were beaten by uh a last minute three point shot	3890	A
and uh so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play uh Brigham Young University tonight	3890	A
and uh i i'm pretty sure uh they really got a good team this year and i think-	3890	A
uh yes they do uh they usually uh they're usually the one or two in the in the WAC conference and they're the only team from Texas	3890	A
	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
uh-huh	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
uh-huh	3890	A
yeah who's doing the who's leading the conference	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
uh i see	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
oh	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
oh oh i see	3890	A
that kind of fouled things up plus maybe	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
right well last year the University of Utah went and uh they had two of their stars uh	3890	A
got hurt the beginning of the season this year and that's why uh uh Texas El Paso is uh is in the University of Utah went to the NC Double A's last year and they- got into the final sixteen i guess but	3890	A
uh UTEP like i say is doing real well and it's it's too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the	3890	A
uh the Longhorns as far as uh being able to play in any of the	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
junior college so it didn't affect their program other than loosing him yeah right that's too bad	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
yeah but	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
oh that's too bad	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
i see	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
good i know uh i was in Montana this last week and i saw the uh	3890	A
huh the women's team from uh Texas was playing uh Penn State	3890	A
and uh Penn State was ranked number eight i believe in the women's basketball and i- i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight uh back to Utah and i uh Texas was leading	3890	A
i don't know how they came out i don't know if you heard or not but uh	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
oh	3890	A
yeah	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
i wish them well	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
that's great	3890	A
<silence>	3890	A
i'll say	3890	A
yeah uh that's uh	3890	A
last year the University of Utah that was the best season they'd had and uh the well the the coach had come in this Rick Majerus he'd come in uh he'd only been there a couple years and uh	3890	A
really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the the first uh uh top ten this year until they lost their two of their their star players and uh through injuries	3890	A
and now they are uh they they did beat uh Texas El Paso and uh that was kind of strange i guess Texas El Paso was just weren't weren't uh	3890	A
hitting and uh	3890	A
 -hello	3818	A
 yes do you have any pets	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
oh what kind	3818	A

um-hum	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
uh-huh	3818	A

kind of inherited and then we have Lady that Gene has been wanting for a long time it's a collie	3818	A
and she is a sweetheart	3818	A
 and we have two cats	3818	A
and one of them_1 now Lady can go up the steps she goes up the steps really really slow	3818	A
and she kisses Nikki	3818	A
and they kind of you know look at each other and everything and then then Chasta- uh Lady'll turn around and come back down stairs but she knows that if she moves fast	3818	A
that uh she's going to move you know	3818	A
yeah	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
yeah and um by the way my other big pet here said he's gonna call you tonight and	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
you have	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
oh you're kidding	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
oh	3818	A
he doesn't have any pets	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
oh	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum um-hum	3818	A
oh for crying out loud well	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
um-hum um-hum well we don't have that problem Lady hardly ever barks at all unless she's outside playing and uh Chasta only barks like when the paper boy delivers the mail she might bark for a little bit	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
hm	3818	A
i'll be	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
oh that's too bad	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
yeah that would that would really be upsetting with me too if my neighbors didn't like my dogs you know	3818	A
and uh well of course two of two other neighbors have dogs you know and they get to come over and play	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum hum	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum um-hum well some people have dogs but they really don't like them_1 i don't know why they even keep them_1	3818	A
you know really some- a lot of people have pets and	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
oh yeah God mine are like my family	3818	A
at night they sit out here by the door by the patio door and look in you know sit side by side	3818	A
so every night i think for two hours every night and then we let them_1 in	3818	A
and they come in they just lay down but just i guess just the idea that they're in the house with us for a while you know	3818	A
uh-huh so	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
well	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
well that's a shame you know and you can- i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that that would be awful	3818	A
you know	3818	A
well that's too bad	3818	A
but anyhow we don't have that problem like i say	3818	A
<silence>	3818	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3818	A
well at least you can still get some right	3818	A
 well that's good well let's see	3818	A
isn't it funny though i just wondered if someday this was going to happen	3818	A
	3818	B
hello	3818	B
i do i have a big dog	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
huh oh he's just a big bloodhound	3818	B
i had some rabbits and they were much easier to take care of than this big dog is	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
well we got the bloodhound and the rabbits and the bloodhound didn't mix well so they were easier to get rid of than the big dog and my kids were anxious to have a have a puppy	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
uh-huh	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
huh	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
 okay well i've had some really interesting things happening with my dog let me tell you about this	3818	B
i have a dog that at nighttime when it wants to go in the garage because_1 he's kind of spoiled he will bark	3818	B
and i have a neighbor next door who gets real mad at this so	3818	B
for the last three weeks he's turned us into the police and in to the uh the animal control and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so	3818	B
it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my kids and to come over and kill the dog it's going- it's just berserk	3818	B
he does he has a dog himself out in the backyard that barks but for some reason this dog's bark just drives him up a wall and he's just	3818	B
i don't know it's been really upsetting he keeps calling and	3818	B
you know it bothers me when the dog barks so as soon as he barks we put him in the garage but	3818	B
i don't know what the problem is	3818	B
he is an alcoholic so i think he's just found something to vent his anger on and it's he's decided that it's us but	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
uh-huh	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
see that's like this dog it only barks i mean the longest it ever barks is five or ten minutes	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
but you know he's called over and said he's going to get the police to take Lee away and that we're idiots for having a dog like that and	3818	B
it's just really been upsetting because_1 they were real good neighbors up until this	3818	B
this time	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
well see everybody everybody all the way up has a dog that's what's so strange every house all- you know all the way up from- on five you know five houses up from me and five houses down have dogs	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah i figure why have them_1 if you're not gonna take real good care of them_1	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
but	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yep that's how this one is	3818	B
	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
huh	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah feel loved huh huh well i haven't i don't know what- i you know i can't figure out how to solve the problem unless i get rid of Kahuna and uh you know	3818	B
i've got to live in this neighborhood so it's almost boiled down to do i	3818	B
do i keep a pet that i love or do i live unhappily in a neighborhood paranoid of whether he's ever gonna bark or not	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
well i'm thinking about going back to rabbits they were quiet mess free	3818	B
so	3818	B
	3818	B
boy	3818	B
well this is really a treat	3818	B
	3818	B
<silence>	3818	B
yeah let's hope it happens again-	3818	B
 do you use credit cards	3854	A
it	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
do you	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
uh-huh	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
i see	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you don't pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
i see	3854	A
i see we used to get the American Express card and	3854	A
stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um	3854	A
benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so	3854	A
uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we don't do	3854	A
or other types of services i'm sure there're some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh i've just wondered what they were they haven't been appealing to us so far	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know you've arrived you've got this card	3854	A
and uh	3854	A
you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh	3854	A
so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i don't know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the Visa- Visa and MasterCard and they said fine we'll give it to you anyway	3854	A
and we said you know	3854	A
	3854	A
so	3854	A
they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and	3854	A
it's wonderful in that respect and we're glad to have them_1 we we	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
it's great you know and it eventually what we're gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and it'll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i don't think the Discover card's gonna make it in the long term	3854	A
um you know we don't need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but it'll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because_1 the price will come down	3854	A
i don't think it's worth fifty five bucks a year	3854	A
when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and they're pitching that in all their commercials i notice	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
well now- now that's interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the conversion fee probably	3854	A
<silence>	3854	A
right	3854	A
well it it's gonna come that way and the reason it's nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources	3854	A
anywhere in the world and that's where we're headed the technology supports that nicely	3854	A
and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen	3854	A
and you don't get uh anything charged to you and that's great it's just insurance we're very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them	3854	A
it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever	3854	A
 um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA	3854	A
yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh that's a great thing for-	3854	A
	3854	B
convenience uh	3854	B
i- i use them_1 for just- uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard	3854	B
but um i- i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
 uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one	3854	B
uh has a twenty dollar- it's a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i- i pay off every month	3854	B
there's no interest charge	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
but and we never carry over we pay off every month	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
well one thing is whenever we rent a car we don't have to pay um any extra insurance	3854	B
so that we uh my husband's uh family lives in New Hampshire	3854	B
and uh	3854	B
it's about_1 ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston	3854	B
so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car	3854	B
so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
	3854	B
	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
oh dear	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah uh-huh	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
um	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
can can you buy groceries with it	3854	B
uh-huh yeah	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah i think so too	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
no it's not	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah you really can and uh also um	3854	B
we travel abroad	3854	B
some	3854	B
and um it um you get MasterCard's accepted everywhere and and you get the	3854	B
a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in traveler's checks of course there are	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah and and even uh converting your traveler's checks at a bank they still charge you a fee	3854	B
and uh	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah um-hum um-hum	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
yeah we do too	3854	B
<silence>	3854	B
	3815	A
well are you in the market for a new car	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
oh what sort of requirements to you have for your car	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
uh-huh	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
 um	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
i see	3815	A
top of top of the line	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
oh	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
right right	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
um-hum um-hum	3815	A
 well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like power- power windows or power locks because the people that i know have- who have them_1 always seem to have trouble with them	3815	A
and um so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and	3815	A
uh i guess a good	3815	A
no i haven't have you	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
somehow i just think you know i like the idea	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
right	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
right that's a good idea	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
 um-hum um-hum	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
 well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i- i guess i did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record	3815	A
good mileage um	3815	A
 and i needed air-conditioning and um	3815	A
 can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift	3815	A
and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that	3815	A
you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a Chrysler um	3815	A
Lancer	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
yeah	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
no a five speed and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it	3815	A
 so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable	3815	A
um	3815	A
 i found that out i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement	3815	A
 so	3815	A
yeah	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports cars but now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift	3815	A
and so why do you like stick shift	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
right right	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
 right and actually it's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
so	3815	A
<silence>	3815	A
	3815	A
	3815	B
uh well yeah i am as a matter of fact well actually- actually i'm looking for another car but uh uh new probably not	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
uh sports car uh usually either black or red	3815	B
and- and electric windows and power locks no	3815	B
well uh not so much that as it is i've had so many times when uh uh you know i- i'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody	3815	B
uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window	3815	B
it is just a real pain or you know if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them_1 it's real difficult to drive reach- reach over and try to roll down the window	3815	B
and uh so power locks and power windows are just just things that uh uh just really help a lot what about you	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
oh	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
sure	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
have you ever had a car with an air bag	3815	B
no	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
 well it it seems- sure seems to save lives and uh yeah i actually i like the antilock brakes	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
and i've never had a chance to i have been in cars that have had them but i've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
but uh you think you'd buy uh an American car or a European or Japanese	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
 what was that	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
huh stick shift huh did it have what a three speed or a four speed	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
wow	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
 well actually i much prefer a stick shift	3815	B
and what i'm i'm curious i- i know why i love a stick shift why do you why did you want one	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
um-hum	3815	B
it's hard to find stick shift cars anymore	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
huh	3815	B
yeah no i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
huh	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
huh	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
um i guess i- i grew up on it and it's fun it's it's an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control	3815	B
over the car and it- it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and ice and slick conditions	3815	B
uh it- it- it does uh i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun	3815	B
<silence>	3815	B
yeah yeah	3815	B
	3815	B
	3875	A
so fishing huh	3875	A
you do much fishing out there	3875	A

well you know we moved from California we moved from northern California to come out here and uh i	3875	A
we did quite a quite a bit of fishing out there but uh out here in uh in Texas it's all man made lake	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A

<silence>	3875	A

than uh i uh am use to in California i'm use to deep sea fishing out there and fishing off the pier and stuff and uh out here in Dallas you have to use lures and	3875	A
uh all kinds of different things i haven't had a chance to go out fishing much here but i use to do a lot of fishing out in California	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A

<silence>	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A

<silence>	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
yeah it is and uh the bait that they use is uh is totally different in California than it is here in Texas and uh	3875	A
um you know we uh use to use live bait in in California and they do use some live bait here but not a not uh whole lot not like you know you use to use in California and uh	3875	A

and we you know we'd get crab and stuff off the pier and and uh	3875	A
that's that's stuff that we that we miss um being here in Texas we don't have much of a chance to get out to the coast and and uh	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
yeah my wife loved to fish she didn't like to uh she doesn't like to put the bait on but	3875	A
you know that was my job i just put the bait on and she'd catch the fish in fact we use to go out and and this was not really that funny at the time but	3875	A
it's funny now you know i'd we would get two poles	3875	A
and i would you know i hook hers up she would be out there and i haven't uh i i i wouldn't even be able to tie my hook on	3875	A
she'd catch a fish and she would yell at me to come and take the fish off so i'd take it off and walk back and put my hook on she'd call again to get get the fish off her hook	3875	A
i mean it went like that for a whole hour	3875	A
	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A

<silence>	3875	A
yeah	3875	A
well uh that's my wife	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
yeah that's my wife uh every time we go fishing she's the one that catches them and i'm the one that takes them off and baits the hook and then it goes all over again so	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
oh is that right	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
<silence>	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A

	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
i use to i don't now	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
oh really	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah that is what it is in Arizona Arizona is where i am from	3875	B
i have only been in California for about two years	3875	B
and in Arizona that is all they have too is man made lakes because of the desert	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
well i lived in Washington State for a while do you know where do you know where Seattle is well it's about thirty miles outside of Seattle there is a place called Westport	3875	B
and it use to be the salmon capitol of the world and when i lived	3875	B
yeah when i lived there i use to go deep sea fishing with my dad all the time and it was really it was really neat but when i went back to Arizona because_1 that is where i am from well when i went back there to be with my mom	3875	B
it was like a totally different kind of fishing i was like ah what do i do	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
i haven't i haven't been fishing since i've been to California because_1 i have been having my kids and	3875	B
two	3875	B
two little boys	3875	B
one's three and one's one	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
sounds like fun	3875	B
i'm stopping at two	3875	B
	3875	B
yes	3875	B
i only want to have to teach two of them how to fish i don't want to have to teach four	3875	B
	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
oh	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah it's amazing how few women actually fish	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
uh-huh	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah my husband gets kind of upset because him and i have an agreement	3875	B
i i'll bait my own hook and i'll catch the fish but he's the one cleaning them because_1 i won't clean them that's the only thing i will not do	3875	B
and uh	3875	B
he gets really disgusted because_1 he he says i i talk to the fish i don't talk to the fish they just jump on my hook	3875	B
that's what he says because i'm really lucky at catching them_1	3875	B
no matter what kind of fishing we are doing i i seem to have really good luck and it's like i don't talk to um and they just jump on my hook i don't know	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
yeah my mom got remarried and she got remarried to uh a commercial fisherman	3875	B
and he was like women don't know how to fish and {da} {da} {da} {da} so him and i went out fishing one day	3875	B
and i and he goes do you need me to bait your hook and i said no i can handle it	3875	B
and so i baited my hook and by the time we left i had six and he had none	3875	B
he goes he goes tell you what	3875	B
why don't you do my job for a while	3875	B
i said no thanks cause i don't clean them	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
so he cleaned them all and i gave him and my mom four of them and i just took two of them	3875	B
but he was just so disgusted because he had never seen anybody that had that good of luck	3875	B
<silence>	3875	B
oh yeah i love fish	3875	B
i i grew up in Arizona so i guess that's why because	3875	B
	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
okay um i think although there have been some i'm still of the opinion that we're second rate citizens in most areas	3869	B
uh i believe probably World War II is when you know the thing started that caused	3869	B
women to be more liberated because the men were at war and they needed women in the factories and things have never been the same	3869	B
as far as the	3869	B
as far as the job market women started working outside the home then but it's taken a long time and i think we've got a long way to go	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
yeah i agree with that	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
um-hum	3869	B
right	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
right	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
no	3869	B
no and then i think it's a good turn i do see uh one of the reasons i also believe there's a lot to be ahead as i return to college and uh	3869	B
i see girls of twenty or so they think there is no problem they don't realize the struggle's just at the last few years	3869	B
for them especially to go into professions that they could've just been laughed at and it can't be done anymore at least legally it can't be done	3869	B
i think	3869	B
yes and i think- just like today i mean it- may be	3869	B
people that don't want you in a certain profession they can't state it where i don't think the change has come like from the men's side is they can still feel it	3869	B
you know i think	3869	B
yes	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
yes	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
um-hum	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
yeah	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
right	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
yeah i wasn't aware of that either until uh just a year ago when i took a sociology course that even existed that's how indoctrinated i was	3869	B
but then i'm forty six i grew up with the generation of the guys my brothers went to college and i'm now struggling to no and it	3869	B
wasn't important you know you go be a secretary or be a beautician	3869	B
that was my choice and uh	3869	B
but yeah i didn't even realize there were societies like you say where women were were important	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
right	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
right	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
right	3869	B
well i find myself looking towards what i'm doing and i'm leaning towards education and that's still another area of women but	3869	B
that's what i wanna do you know have made- i have made that decision that that's what i want to do even if it is the traditional thing it's still what i wanna do and i know it's like	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
 right	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
yes i'm suffering- suffering through that too yeah	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
 i was very seriously	3869	B
<silence>	3869	B
well i'm not because i have been tested by the office-	3869	B
	3869	A
	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
yeah	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
um-hum um-hum	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
uh well i agree with you there i feel that there's	3869	A
there's is a turning point ahead- still ahead of us we haven't gotten there yet	3869	A
	3869	A
 excuse me but i do think that	3869	A
there is a greater awareness of the the benefits that the the feminine side of people offers you know as well as men you know when you	3869	A
	3869	A
half a generation ago wouldn't have even considered as feasible	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
um-hum	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
um-hum	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
yes	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
that's true that is fairly recent	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
uh-huh	3869	A
i feel- i definitely feel that that's true in the political arena it's gonna be a lot longer before women are in positions of authority- authority on a on a majority basis you know there's always gonna be a a few but	3869	A
you know whereas in education and in health care women dominate because those are seen as supportive roles	3869	A
i think it's interesting to just look at the history of women in history- in in several cultures to to determine why in Western culture	3869	A
they take the role that they do because it's- it's a matriarchial society in a lot of different parts of the world that that puts women in a much stronger position and yet in the west it's	3869	A
just coming around to the point that we can recognize that the power that that a woman offers to the society you know in terms of nurturing as well as	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
um-hum um-hum	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
that's exciting	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
uh still a lot of that influence	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
yes yes and there's so much that's	3869	A
um {inculturated} we don't realize in the home how we're	3869	A
how we're influenced i think that even though my parents might've said you know i'm i'm in an area uh health care where there are a lot of women obviously but	3869	A
my orientation was never toward being a physician it was toward being a health care provider in another area and	3869	A
even though i heard from my my father it certainly go you know pursue as far as you can you can be a physician there was this under lying tone in our home because my mom did not work outside the home that it was also okay to not do that and so	3869	A
it's been a challenge to to cope with both of my orientations i- i have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside the home	3869	A
	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
um-hum hum	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
yes i think that over time we will recognize what	3869	A
our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather that- that are different from men and and it's okay that	3869	A
that there are some differences but that there are also a lot more areas that can overlap that that at this point don't i think girls are told that they're probably not gonna be as good at math as as boys are and and they they	3869	A
they may be influenced by that in their school work	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
i don't know if i was by my by the influence or whether i just am not very oriented in math as i am to other like verbal	3869	A
<silence>	3869	A
 okay you're probably uh more up on this subject than i am but	3809	A
the roles that women have played the last couple- couple of year in our are couple of generations	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last	3809	A
oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling	3809	A
you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry uh	3809	A
there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five- five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and	3809	A
you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you bet that's sort of neat	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
sure i think uh it's the age- age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that	3809	A
you know women are paid less than men and they're and they're doing the same uh	3809	A
or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way	3809	A
and	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
i think so hope so and-	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
absolutely-	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you know i've	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
 right yeah they forget also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know	3809	A
if if a a woman Congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever	3809	A
so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way	3809	A
but i guess just the most significant thing- change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going	3809	A
and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good a good statement	3809	A
and i think if in the future it's even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
wow	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
 good point	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
right now i'm self employed and and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my business uh she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so	3809	A
you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business and she still works everyday so	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
uh-oh enjoying- enjoying it what kind of work do you do	3809	A
well good	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
right married	3809	A
yeah	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
well- well	3809	A
trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
you see the old uh	3809	A
 cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way	3809	A
<silence>	3809	A
baby right and uh you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that and	3809	A
it's really true women have come a long way and you know	3809	A
	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
that	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
right well they've entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started	3809	B
and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
right	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
yeah the you see more of that you see more of them_1 uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too	3809	B
you know i- i go to a i have a club that i belong to Altrusa that you know one of the girls travels quite extensively and she said well my children have two parents you know why not	3809	B
so that that's a i think that's a change and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
right	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
no that that i think should change will change in the near future also it's been changing it's been evolving but there's still a an	3809	B
an inequality in the work force in certain jobs it's you know and you hear some people say you know well he's a man he he he needs that salary	3809	B
	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
right	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
and going yeah um-hum	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah i- i think it will be i think i well another- another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they're out there i guess is that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind	3809	B
um because in the past the male bought the cars but now they're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases	3809	B
and that they are looking for um	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
different things in the car the man is looking for the engine- in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel	3809	B
uh can her makeup come off the upholstery and if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out there that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
right	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
yeah we all do	3809	B
 i'm just happen to be off today so i work too	3809	B
i'm a nurse	3809	B
and i work at Medical Treatment Center um which is at Garland- uh Jupiter and Arapaho	3809	B
	3809	B
 no	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
i don't know	3809	B
i'm kind of out of out of things	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
 you've come a long way baby	3809	B
right	3809	B
<silence>	3809	B
<silence>	3894	B
the federal budget boy	3894	B
i was just writing something down that	3894	B
came to mind as i observed what's happened in our society	3894	B
um	3894	B
we i think have become	3894	B
uh dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that really only we can do for ourself	3894	B
and i think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to that	3894	B
uh	3894	B
we have elected people who really don't know how to manage	3894	B
the money uh they collect	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
i mean i think it really affects all of us to a degree Glen i think we are i mean i- i went through a P H D program that was funded by the Office of Navel Research that's now investigating Stanford and Harvard and MIT	3894	B
i mean we're talking about things that have done some good but have institutionalized corruption	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
right well and we need to spend the money better i mean we do not need eight hundred military bases around the world	3894	B
there are lot of things we don't we don't need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we don't need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy farm- i mean basically	3894	B
you know it it is really true that this this country is suffering because um we are it's not that we don't have the resources we are just squandering them	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
that's the way it was working on a defense department contract that's what happened-	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
right well that's the way the that's the way the thing works	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
that's right i've seen that happen and it's it what's even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations	3894	B
 is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because we're the smart guys and without us society can't function and that that's no license to steal	3894	B
i mean i- i honest to God believe that's what- what's been going on and that was sort of seeped into the way we operated in those contexts	3894	B
and at the time i you know people i mean it was it was acceptable it's no longer acceptable	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
right	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
right and it it's not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldn't survive	3894	B
and do a a you know variety of other things if we put the money in the right place which is investing in people in the development of human capital	3894	B
in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought they'd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
right	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they haven't been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard MIT or Stanford education if it's that good and you really	3894	B
<silence>	3894	B
right but all the people who who are responsible for handling these kids were trained in universities and colleges	3894	B
okay and my point is hey wait a minute something's wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if it's the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around	3894	B
okay so ask yourself some questions why don't we have a higher quality with one of the world's great universities Harvard and Stanford both have schools of education	3894	B
i mean this is a focus it's not like this isn't an interest of theirs this is a specific focus two of the best funded institutions in the country	3894	B
premier universities in the world hey wait a minute how come they can't produce something like MTV which kids want	3894	B
	3894	A
yes	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
i agree with that	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
 well what we've got um in my view is is a situation where	3894	A
 we've got more people like you say that are customed- that are accustomed to being taken care of and than we	3894	A
	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
yeah well i- i really i think if you from a	3894	A
yeah i- i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think we're gonna have to eventually balance the budget or we're gonna sink	3894	A
we can't continue to pay the kind of interest that we're paying on the deficit	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
that's true	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
oh yeah throwing them away uh it's just like uh uh programs that are federally funded that if they if the they don't spend their allotment uh	3894	A
	3894	A
 then they're then they're subject to losing the next year's allotment	3894	A
yeah and go into a spending frenzy at the year of the end- at year end	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
right that's true	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
well and	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
well and- well and so many people have have uh the feeling that well if it's if there if it's federal money then it's free money well it's not it costs everybody	3894	A
and uh it- you know just because you can uh get something from the feds uh uh that doesn't necessarily make it morally uh responsible	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
well and and and well don't even began to talk about the educational system i mean is that is one example where it's being proven that throwing money does not create a good education okay-	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
yeah but i'm even talking- i'm i'm not even i'm not even talking about higher education we're- i'm talking about the the kids that we've got now they come out of high school that can't read and write	3894	A
and that also it just even the ones that that do read and write that really have a very poor poor grasp of of what a secondary education should have given them	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
uh true	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
right	3894	A
<silence>	3894	A
	3894	A
	3829	B
uh well since Christmas we painted a bedroom and did some wallpapering in there i had to do most of it since uh my wife was working	3829	B
uh Austin yeah and getting- getting ready around here to do some uh major yard work as soon as the weather turns a little bit nicer	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but i figure i'd just be wasting my time	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
uh i've always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that except maybe i don't do heaters and air conditioners but	3829	B
i usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and things	3829	B
uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh it's kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it we've only we only moved here about a year ago	3829	B
what about you what kind of house you live in	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
about two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville which is like forty miles east of Austin over toward Houston uh little old stucco house built in nineteen twenty one and uh	3829	B
we bought it to- for- to get- for a weekend getaway	3829	B
and it needed a lot of work but we saw it when we first looked at it we can do this and uh sure enough uh it's oh nineteen months later we sold it for twenty six and we bought it for sixteen five	3829	B
and we did things like paint uh inside and outside and basically repaired the garages we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my part but	3829	B
it was something i thought the place needed because_1 it had real high ceilings and uh just and just in general did everything we uh put in a hot water heater a new toilet and things like that kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
well we weren't think- talking about reselling it when we started doing it we were looking for something to do on weekends	3829	B
and it because_1 my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment and if it doesn't work try another color things like that	3829	B
so but when the offer came to us it was from a neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them_1 and we thought well you know we're not we hadn't been out here but what once in three months and	3829	B
and we had just bought this house in Austin so we thought well what the heck let's make a little money on it	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
 yeah i'd like to uh	3829	B
we have bought new homes in the past and and we'll never do that again because it was just boring for- after about a week	3829	B
 yeah so	3829	B
uh out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down oh terribly run down home and uh it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make almost forty five thousand in profit on it	3829	B
and that was just	3829	B
yeah uh it's just we you know we map out what we want to do and we go for it uh	3829	B
whoever's got time to do it and course you get the major things done like your you know have the floors redone or have carpet put in whatever but the rest of it we usually do ourselves	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
yeah i uh i think about that from time to time because_1 we've never actually you know built one that we wanted you know the way we wanted it and things like that but	3829	B
i'm not sure that our interest is that piqued in it to do something like that	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
yeah renovation- renovation is kind of where we're at like our our favorite TV program is This Old House has been for many years	3829	B
and we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it uh	3829	B
there again we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home and because they're so it's a town that time has passed by so there are a lot of old big homes and they're fairly inexpensive	3829	B
so	3829	B
it's forty miles uh it's on the it's on the river and it's a quite nice little town they've been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things i mean there's no KMarts or anything like that around so	3829	B
makes it kind of nice	3829	B
<silence>	3829	B
 you been doing in your house	3829	A
<silence>	3829	A
yeah	3829	A

uh we lived in a brick homes in uh in Louisiana before this and did some uh various kinds of things uh made some storm windows to put up and	3829	A
uh	3829	A
uh really did a major {rejob} on the inside of the house uh put up some walls and uh put in a bathroom and stuff like that	3829	A
uh	3829	A
<silence>	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A

<silence>	3878	B
uh we did we got snow about a week and a half ago	3878	B
and it was it was really wild because uh	3878	B

<silence>	3878	B
but it was between uh	3878	B
just where the clouds were and where you know but when the snow got down here	3878	B
it was cold enough to freeze it and then it just stayed frozen it was wet snow i guess is what they call it when is starts thawing before it hits the ground	3878	B
<silence>	3878	B
really	3878	B
<silence>	3878	B

or high pressure	3878	B
so we're um	3878	B
we're going to be stable for a while they say through Sunday	3878	B
yeah that'd be	3878	B
<silence>	3878	B
uh-huh	3878	B
yeah	3878	B
<silence>	3878	B
uh-huh	3878	B
<silence>	3878	B
uh-huh	3878	B
<silence>	3878	B
um-hum exactly	3878	B
<silence>	3878	B
	3834	A
in dollars and lives and the long term effects	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
 you ready i i'll hit it if you're ready to start okay	3834	A
 my name's Karen by the way what what's your name	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
San Francisco	3834	A
oh nice to meet you	3834	A
	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
ready to go	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
you you think it was a winnable war then	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
you mean the effects of of of Vietnam being to encourage him to to be more defensive in his posture and go for	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
i meant offensive i'm sorry uh-huh	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
um	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
i do think one of the effects was that the uh people involved in that kind of an um activity were surprised at the power that the media had on um intervening and probably	3834	A
set the tone for media's involvement in future whether it was a war activity or	3834	A
something along those lines that are going to involve a number of people	3834	A
everything changed after that in terms of media	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
well you remember in the Gulf War they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in	3834	A
 Vietnam war they weren't about to have people out in there reporting	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
um	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least	3834	A
<silence>	3834	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3834	A
	3834	B
uh-huh	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
well uh	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
oh i'm ready yeah sure	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
Karen my name's John Benyak where do you live	3834	B
oh i live in Dallas	3834	B
just outside of Dallas	3834	B
nice talking to you	3834	B
what's that mean we're ready to go	3834	B
okay well it uh the way it turned out it wasn't worth anything really i just don't think i've always thought that uh	3834	B
it just wasn't carried on the way it should have been it wasn't carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just uh	3834	B
we	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
well i think we'd uh we'd uh beat them i don't think uh	3834	B
i don't know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but uh i think if we'd uh had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war	3834	B
instead of letting the politicians and the	3834	B
and the peace and people like that dictate the terms of the way we fought i think things would have turned out a lot differently	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and uh or at least it is now and there's no way	3834	B
that if we'd uh been able to take uh	3834	B
use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have uh what would have lost it as a war uh the long term effects well	3834	B
i uh i don't know that's that's a little tougher to answer i think uh	3834	B
depends i guess on who's in office but uh i think Bush used that uh last year in the Persian Gulf uh by taking some stronger stronger measures and when the war started	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they decided-	3834	B
once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much uh	3834	B
run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in Vietnam is that uh they we escalated and uh just you know on a gradual basis and gave the	3834	B
um North Vietnamese and Viet Cong time to adjust to our uh	3834	B
increases in uh personnel and so forth they just didn't go in there if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially uh i think things would have been differently but different but it uh they went from	3834	B
having the advisors uh up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the uh	3834	B
the enemy just gradually adjusted to that and	3834	B
they didn't uh the people the country the people here didn't want the war the way it turned out they didn't want it that's	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
uh-huh	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
right	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
oh really	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
right well there are	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
yeah there were every every night you'd come home from work and uh or school or whatever and see it on the uh the news i	3834	B
imagine that wasn't the case during World War Two or any of the other wars uh people just didn't feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of	3834	B
a lot of	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
uh-huh	3834	B
right	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
right yeah but uh i just uh	3834	B
i i guess i was in my let's see	3834	B
my twenties during during most of that war and i i never did think that they were they were doing it right i i'm just not a uh a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her i mean that she'd go around speaking on different campuses and	3834	B
getting people uh aroused about the whole thing and of course uh they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that's what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority and	3834	B
people were listening to to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt	3834	B
i was in the service at that time i wasn't over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn't fight it like they should have and it's a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you're over there and	3834	B
people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and	3834	B
either win or lose based on the fact that it's a war and not just uh uh mealy mouth their their way through the thing and try to get the um other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth	3834	B
<silence>	3834	B
oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have lost- i i i just don't think we could have lost the the	3834	B
<silence>	3853	A
i have trouble uh coming up with things that actually i've considered invasion of privacy and perhaps it's because i've become so accustomed to the fact that that's the way technology works	3853	A
	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
what's that	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
oh gosh yes yes	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
i suppose that it's an invasion in that they know where you are and and	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
oh seriously i've never had that experience	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
that seems unusual	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
you know that almost seems dangerous because_1 what if you picked up the phone to call nine one one or something and you	3853	A
i wonder if that was a problem in their system that doesn't seem like it should work that way	3853	A
haunting you	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
i used to be concerned that everyone no matter what the creditor always wanted to know your social security number but then i figured well they're	3853	A
they all have to link it back to some number that -that only you have and so	3853	A
	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
they have access to all your records	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
um-hum um-hum	3853	A
if you wanna use credit you have to pay the price and that's	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
that's probably why you have gotten those calls because they know that you're one of those people who um are in a	3853	A
i don't know income bracket or something but who has disposable income that's why they're after you	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
do you own do you rent	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
yeah i generally don't	3853	A
you know when you buy a new product how the um warranty card always asks your level of income	3853	A
and it usually says optional so i i rarely fill it i i don't think i ever fill it out frankly but uh they they wanna know they would like to come back and	3853	A
see whether or not you're gonna buy another product	3853	A
interesting	3853	A
that's how marketing works today i think	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
are you	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
um-hum um-hum	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
really huh	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
oh yeah you don't wanna take risks	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
do you personally look at those credit uh references or is there someone else who does that	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
someone else in your company does that	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
oh really so there isn't someone who every time does it just not you	3853	A
hm	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
but most of them are checked on routinely just by someone else	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
uh-huh that makes sense	3853	A
<silence>	3853	A
	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
 life is yeah well you know there's something that um i really find kind of maybe it's not an invasion of privacy but it's kind of annoying	3853	B
um you know phone calls uh automated	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
you know i mean i- i find that really {offencing} or offensive	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
yeah and they don't stop i mean they you know you call and it	3853	B
	3853	B
it could be any time of the day and and what happens is is they'll call especially- especially those computer ones	3853	B
they'll call and and they don't you can't get them_1 off the line you'll hang up and you pick it up a minute later and they'll still be on there	3853	B
 yes i just had you know that just happened a couple day of i guess it's kind of fresh in my mind because_1 this happened a couple of days ago	3853	B
i'd picked up the phone and it's you know they started talking giving me all this spiel and then you know you try to hang up because_1 there's there's nobody to talk to there's only just um	3853	B
and- you hang up and then you pick up to make a phone they're still on there	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
i know i know that is	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
but uh as far as privacy- uh invasion of privacy i there really you know i guess i'm kind of like you i don't really find it	3853	B
there isn't a whole lot that i feel like it's a invasion of privacy- of privacy um	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
oh i know	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
well the	3853	B
i guess you know there's um	3853	B
i- guess- i guess i don't think about that very often because it it has become the norm you know um	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
yeah and you they find everything- i mean they find out everything about you they want to know your you know where you live what you do what you know and some of the questions yeah and some of the	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
uh-huh	3853	B
yes you know sometimes that does happen you know sometimes they they would you know somebody would call on the phone and and uh you know you think it's just	3853	B
uh regular type questions but really they are kind of prying into your to your life you know you	3853	B
they wanna know uh where you live how long you been living there	3853	B
do you own do you rent you know what time of the days they're usually home what uh you know and sometimes you know you just kind of go through the routine of giving it out and then you think about it afterwards	3853	B
	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
yes	3853	B
uh-huh	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
right	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
oh yeah oh yeah	3853	B
yep	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
but um	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
i guess it is i'm i'm in that area so it's uh	3853	B
well i'm yeah i'm in sales so i	3853	B
you always kind of uh you know it- i know that when we when i sell a product to a new customer	3853	B
that's always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that	3853	B
um you know but i know that in order for our company to survive we can't you know uh	3853	B
don't wanna take the risks so	3853	B
um i- i suppose some of those uh	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
you know that's- that's the funniest thing is be rare i mean maybe one out of ten	3853	B
do we check on it yeah you know but it's kind of a routine type thing where you just do it and and you file it away and uh	3853	B
you know at random we'll we'll go ahead and check on it but um it's not	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
no huh-uh	3853	B
so you know i just gather the information and and somebody else uh you know at their leisure time uh will check on those credit references but	3853	B
<silence>	3853	B
yeah most of them_1 are yeah most of them_1 are but they're not all you know they're not done all at the same time	3853	B
and um	3853	B
you know i- i wonder about credit uh	3853	B
	3800	B
uh yes uh uh not as much as i used to we used to have quite a few credit cards and over the the last few years we've tried to cut them back a little bit and and uh down to mainly- mainly one each uh	3800	B
uh it's it's easy to let them_1 get out of control	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
oh	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yeah yeah that's uh that's what we try to to go to uh and eliminate all the uh uh department store uh credit cards uh got rid of all those	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they don't have to be as credit conscious they can	3800	B
yeah they can write off a lot more losses now	3800	B
uh which which i kind of disagree uh with i'd rather them_1 going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yeah i i've heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
well- yeah	3800	B
well well people- people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they don't look at at spending uh eighteen percent on on credit it's uh for some reason they don't look at it that way	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
that	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
that's that's true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them_1 off but there's	3800	B
sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them_1 off but	3800	B
but the people who who can't afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it it's sort of like the federal government	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yes that's right	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh	3800	B
uh i think it would only mean that they'd they'd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and they'd probably make just as much money they just wouldn't write off as many losses	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yeah that's that's right	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yes uh	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didn't look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and that's in uh in real estate and other things and it's the same with credit cards	3800	B
<silence>	3800	B
yeah we i- i use a company one somewhat uh uh to- to uh	3800	B
do air travel and all but uh i make sure that one's always uh paid off because_1 i'm responsible for the interest on that one if if i don't pay it off uh uh	3800	B
i work for uh an oil company and they they issue a an American Express card so that you don't have to ask for uh expense advances when you have to travel and buy air tickets so	3800	B
so you just use your card but it's but it's in your name so it's up to you to pay it off and and because it's American Express you can't run up a a credit on it so that	3800	B
 card yourself or	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
 yeah it's i work at a at a financial institution and seen quite a bit used to be a loan officer and	3800	A
seen people with you know they've had well i've seen a person with forty thousand dollars in limits and about twenty thousand dollars of it used and i and we we've got one but it's just for absolute emergencies we hardly ever use it	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
for sure	3800	A
yeah they uh they can like you say you can once you start using them they they're always real- real willing to raise those limits for you that's for sure	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
no they can afford to write off a lot more	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
that's excuse me yeah that's true i uh	3800	A
well i can't see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i can't imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because_1 there's-	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah well that make you- you know that makes sense i guess if they're they're not willing to write off as much but	3800	A
you know it there's a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we sent- we'll take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars cost- or a year for the just the fee and everything it	3800	A
i don't know i just i have a hard time i like i say i	3800	A
working in a financial institution i just i'm really rate conscious i guess and can't see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yep there's i imagine there's there's quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they don't have to charge- you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that can't pay it off monthly and get	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah that's true	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
	3800	A
yeah i uh i- i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt they've got it just seems like they're	3800	A
they right now they can't afford to buy anymore because they're up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know that's part of the reason i think everything's kind of stalled out but	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
that exactly you know when that thing was they were trying to pass through- through- that through Congress they the thing that Congress didn't realize is that yeah they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and you know it would slow you know they were trying to	3800	A
pick things up but it would just it do wouldn't do any good because you know the banks aren't stupid they're going to realize that they can't you know they can't keep affording to write off five percent if they're only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
that's true	3800	A
that's true	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
i don't know what will happen like i say we're sure trying we we just got the one and we just don't want to get any more	3800	A
no	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
if it's not huh huh where do you work at	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
oh do you	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um	3800	A
uh yeah	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
turn in the voucher	3800	A
<silence>	3800	A
um	3800	A
	3860	A
well it's a topic that um my husband and i often discuss because	3860	A
um i don't have any grandparents and my mother is deceased so um we think about that often times with my father but there's plenty of other siblings to help out	3860	A
however on my husband's side um he has one sibling who is mentally retarded and um and then his parents and so we wonder you know how we're going to make ends meet once they're gone	3860	A
um	3860	A
you know my mother-in-law constantly says things like well- you know well i wish if one of us goes i wish we'd all go like in a car accident so that nobody would help nobody would have to worry about it but uh	3860	A
um it's a scary issue i think	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
uh-huh	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
um	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
um	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
wow	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
wow wow	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
um	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
yes i know	3860	A
one	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
um i think that's kind of the ideal situation is to have a combination retirement home nursing home and even you know if they need special care	3860	A
um my husband's grandmother is in a nursing home and	3860	A
i don't think they've termed what she has as Alzheimer's but it you know she reverts a lot back to her childhood	3860	A
and she doesn't know who you are often times- often times she does the one thing that she retains as far as her memory is concerned is um hymns	3860	A
you know religious hymns she can sing them um and remember all the verses but when you talk to her she doesn't know who you are but	3860	A
 the home that she is in uh it seems like a nice home but there are a lot of people there that are really bad badly off and they have them all combined together	3860	A
and so her roommate um	3860	A
is um a person who entered herself into the home because she has really bad arthritis but mentally she is completely there so you know i don't know about that type of situation where	3860	A
you know you have a mixture but there is a home here in Dallas that um it's a Methodist home	3860	A
um for the elderly and uh	3860	A
they have that kind of situation it seems like what you were talking about with your parents retirement home and a nursing home	3860	A
you know and even a hospital somewhat attached you know for those who need	3860	A
you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if if i had to one of those	3860	A
um	3860	A
that's about	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
oh really	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
um	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
yeah	3860	A
<silence>	3860	A
had to uh face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home	3860	B
<silence>	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
<silence>	3860	B
yeah	3860	B
<silence>	3860	B
well i've been very fortunate uh my father	3860	B
uh was very careful in laying plans for his uh latter years	3860	B
and he was very concerned that uh mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years	3860	B
deciding where he wanted to be	3860	B
and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm	3860	B
and uh invested in a uh nursing home in Central Virginia	3860	B
and uh moved in there	3860	B
and uh he made that decision on his own and uh he made a good choice he found one that had uh pleasant conditions for for him and mother living together and it had a uh nursing home attached to it	3860	B
and everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because uh they moved into the uh to the retirement home in August	3860	B
and he died in September	3860	B
just just before his uh uh eightieth birthday	3860	B
and uh it was fortunate that uh	3860	B
uh he had made those provisions because at that point uh mother had uh Alzheimer's disease	3860	B
and her mental faculties were going very rapidly	3860	B
and that's that's uh something that's very stressful to handle	3860	B
so uh we were very fortunate in having her in the right spot	3860	B
<silence>	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
<silence>	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
<silence>	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
<silence>	3860	B
yeah my uh i have uh an aunt who's in a uh home in Charlotte North Carolina	3860	B
and they they had planned on that for a number of years and actually uh made the payment on the condominium or the apartment uh oh fifteen years before they moved in	3860	B
and uh so when my aunt finally got to the point her eyesight deteriorated and she could no longer drive and it was getting awkward to get to the store for groceries and things like that	3860	B
and uh she moved in it was only about	3860	B
oh it's walking distance to where she lived so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals	3860	B
um it's kind of amazing the disparity that exists between	3860	B
some-	3860	B
	3813	A
do you um have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
um-hum	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
yeah	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
oh well we don't have a real strict budget um	3813	A
we have a a low budget to work on but we um you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we- we just spend about so much we don't	3813	A
i- i don't know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there	3813	A
a certain amount	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
yeah	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
oh	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
wow that's great	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
oh	3813	A
oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
hm	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
yeah well that's a good idea	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
let's see the the other thing there the topic was talking about was	3813	A
if you if i don't all i can think of is if you don't keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses but um	3813	A
 one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas well not fly back but somehow we get back there	3813	A
and um this year we did it by train because_1 it was the least expensive and	3813	A
huh oh yeah	3813	A
and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare	3813	A
and so um	3813	A
 we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and	3813	A
entertainment things like that then um	3813	A
somewhere in out in the wash it'll come out that we have enough to get back there you know	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
uh-huh that's right	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
uh-huh that's right	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
yeah well whenever i don't know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will i'll probably pick it up	3813	A
	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
yeah i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in count it up at the end of the year something	3813	A
but yeah	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
<silence>	3813	A
	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
 well for many many years uh	3813	B
my wife and i did have a budget uh we were both working at the time and so forth	3813	B
and um	3813	B
that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of	3813	B
uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation	3813	B
so it it's uh it's been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of	3813	B
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
sure uh-huh	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
um-hum	3813	B
i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh	3813	B
you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i- i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there	3813	B
as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that	3813	B
 yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff	3813	B
and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal- personal storage	3813	B
 well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall when- if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up	3813	B
so it's it's worked very well that way at least that way we you know if each of us finds something is missing	3813	B
uh we put it up uh the other person might not know about it	3813	B
that way we can keep up to date	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
uh-huh	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
sure well i think we unconsciously do the same thing excuse me my throat's not as clear today as it should be	3813	B
uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks	3813	B
tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money	3813	B
so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip	3813	B
so that- that is another way of uh budgeting	3813	B
and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we don't throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice	3813	B
<silence>	3813	B
 i do the same thing i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter	3813	B
 yeah	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
well let's face it then when we talking budget	3813	B
it is important to to have a budget and uh i- i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the	3813	B
level of my checking- checking account and i have a money market account also	3813	B
and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum	3813	B
and i'm always trying to	3813	B
	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
well um most of what i do is um listen to the news in the morning when i'm heading to work um	3886	B
 we get uh we have two different stations here that run uh National Public Radio and i really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when i'm driving home from work so that's where i get most of my stuff uh	3886	B
yeah we we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the Washington Post here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper	3886	B
and uh so it's you know it's it's uh between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to uh listen to the evening news but not very often how about_1	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
yeah i don't blame you it's it's uh it's	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
yeah and it actually	3886	B
well no i it's i guess what is it it's um it's kind of a talk radio station it's run by a university here called American University or at least that the the general program that i listen to National Public Radio itself is um	3886	B
a uh uh a syndicated thing that's run by a group that operates here in Washington uh but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good	3886	B
especially in Austin come to think of it uh that you're going to be able to get it down there uh	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
yeah	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
well i don't know whatever your you know it it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and uh and so forth and and uh	3886	B
this uh the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize it's kind of a bluegrass station or something	3886	B
um but uh yeah that that's i'm i'm dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special features on Austin it's a real interesting radio program because they they don't just cover-	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
um -well that's very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as i'm driving home	3886	B
and um what they do is they they give you uh about a five to ten minute news uh broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they they cover	3886	B
um topics either of current interest or every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on on some uh particular thing like yeah like perhaps- for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah it's uh	3886	B
yeah it's real good and it it it uh the other thing is is is- my politics are kind of liberal and and um so they have a tendency being public radio to	3886	B
sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you you've got to give them_1 credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story	3886	B
and uh they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves either	3886	B
	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
yeah yeah i'm the same way but the the evening news on TV it's it's really it's so short that you just uh i don't feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh McNeil Lehrer report on public TV	3886	B
i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long	3886	B
and uh with- you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i i used to try to watch it used- used to make me feel like oh well this is uh something i should be watching	3886	B
	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
yeah exactly and	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
which way which which way does it lean is it conservative or	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
oh wow	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
that's good yeah	3886	B
<silence>	3886	B
well that's interesting-	3886	B
 how do you get your news coverage	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
uh-huh	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
oh that's pretty nice	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
right	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
yeah that's just about all i get is the evening news and the and the newspaper sometimes i wish the evening news was like an hour long instead of thirty minutes	3886	A
but that would be nice to have uh um you know- all is it an all news uh radio station	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
uh-huh	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
i- i guess i never i never really tried that it probably is on the AM i know it's not on FM	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
well it's probably picking up um KLBJ that's a real famous	3886	A
um uh Lady Bird used to own it	3886	A
 radio station here but um they're not so much news as they are um uh as far as musicians and and things going on around Austin	3886	A
you know	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
some subject yeah	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
well not bad that sounds pretty interesting	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
right	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
oh i guess Dan Rather i'll switch around i'm not really partial you know one like Monday i might have one and Tuesday i might have another one you know just to get a different view	3886	A
you know or just someone different but uh	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
yeah um-hum	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
yeah yeah it's a little draggy	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
 yeah until it gets a little boring though i know there is something better on	3886	A
so it- it's pretty nice in that the newspaper here it's it's it's only you only have one newspaper and um it's it's kind of biased	3886	A
but um it it's all right	3886	A
<silence>	3886	A
yeah it's very conservative i would say it's very conservative but you know being it's only you- you don't have one in the evening and you don't have a choice	3886	A
and you know i don't i don't like that but other- i have uh uh small newspaper community um that's oh it's- it's um	3886	A
uh just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people and uh it's free and it's real nice	3886	A
yeah i really like it you yeah it- it's like the small hometown newspaper you know you can put your kid's picture in there if they had a birthday or or something like that you know or some	3886	A
	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
uh probably not from what i've been hearing i mean there's not enough getting done	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
well you think this AIDS thing has been around since about nineteen eighty and	3843	B
i would have thought by now they'd have been a lot more advances	3843	B
in treatment and then again i guess there is i mean there's some drugs that they didn't have and	3843	B
i'm sure that didn't come cheap	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
it's pretty uh	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah i keep thinking that myself	3843	B
i i was i last year when the war thing was going on and it was over and they said it costed you know like seventy billion or something	3843	B
and they said if they had that much money for AIDS research they could have found found a cure	3843	B
so i kind of wondered about that i mean	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
to me that's an astronomical amount of money and uh	3843	B
but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
there again that doesn't seem like a whole lot of money	3843	B
you know if to do something like that with	3843	B
uh but i i kind of agree with you we should spend more in this country for not only AIDS but a lot of other things before we start helping other countries	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
i mean in in in your own financial budget if if you're not doing well you're not going to help out anyone else	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
but but that's not the way this country is or ever been i think we've always	3843	B
they had reasons for it i think i heard one just the other day that	3843	B
because of all the money he was you know giving away right now uh the president was i think his wife said something with well like we've got to keep these countries in a democratic mode	3843	B
uh sometimes i don't think it matters	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
my wife and i used to work at a research laboratory for the government	3843	B
and i know things go slow	3843	B
an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing sometimes	3843	B
so i understand	3843	B
you know where the money gets ate up at and	3843	B
but there really should just be more	3843	B
and now that	3843	B
yeah and now that uh you know the weapon spending is going down	3843	B
but we could put some of these laboratories even like the one we worked at at Los Alamos we could put them onto you know more AIDS things	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
not that i know of	3843	B
i think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the street and i heard a rumor that one of them died with AIDS	3843	B
but i never knew for sure i met them once or twice because they used to sell plants in the yard but	3843	B
i never really considered that i knew them so	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
<silence>	3843	B
actually-	3843	B
do you think do we spend enough on that or	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
oh yeah	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah i just kind of wonder uh you know i've been thinking	3843	A
i don't know how much they spend on cancer and how much they spend on AIDS and some of those other things but it seems like uh	3843	A
you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of people that are affected uh cancer seems to affect a lot more people and you'd think they need to spend more on that but	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah that's true it's uh i don't know it's kind of interesting issue you wonder	3843	A
now it's gotten so out of hand that you know it's not just that the homosexual population and stuff like that uh you know it's affected everybody just even if you go to a hospital it's	3843	A
kind of hard to know what to do and	3843	A
you really i don't even think they have really a decent- a decent idea of how many people really have it i	3843	A
i would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and	3843	A
	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
it's kind of a scary-	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
wait whether amongst	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah seventy	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where we're getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country you know or to support the Soviet Union this that and the other and	3843	A
you know i sometimes wonder if it's not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems and you know AIDS being one of them to	3843	A
i think didn't the President put i don't know if it was a billion or so more dollars or something in the budget this well i guess it was in ninety one to try and find a cure for it or	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah it's kind of kind of ironic ourselves we're on the down trend and here we are trying to still pick other people up and	3843	A
seems like that's all we ever do and it comes back to haunt us in the long run	3843	A
but	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah yeah that's true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own house and put your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah i	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
no and and	3843	A
yeah i i i agree that just	3843	A
and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know i guess if we didn't help the Soviet Union there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but	3843	A
you know we're either paying for it in weapons and arms or we're paying we're giving it to them for nothing you know	3843	A
and then we you know at least we have jobs when we're making all the weapons and stuff it seemed like and now we don't even have those because we cut back so much and then we give it away and you just wonder what we really get out of it	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
more money spent	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
well uh do you know that much about i mean have you ever met anybody that has AIDS or	3843	A
yeah i've never met anybody myself but	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
just more passing but	3843	A
yeah i just i haven't had anything strike home so it really hasn't hit me as bad and and sometimes- you know you tend to sometimes wonder well hey you know you kind of brought it on yourself but like i say now it's getting so much more in	3843	A
into society that people that you know have no intention of doing anything you know kind of end up with it and	3843	A
you know little kids and stuff like that that	3843	A
that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to	3843	A
to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other	3843	A
you know type diseases out there it seems you hear a lot more about the AIDS activists than you do these other people with these other diseases and	3843	A
<silence>	3843	A
 so you have a child	3811	A
two years old in child care right now	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
uh	3811	A
yes our first and he just turned three months	3811	A
so we're just starting into hunting for child care right now both of us are students	3811	A
uh uh University of Southern Mississippi	3811	A
um	3811	A
she's	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
uh probably um	3811	A
actually spring semester a year from now he's gonna have to be in child care for- uh five days a week	3811	A
more than likely uh depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing her internship that semester it'll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four six- anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point right now we're trying to avoid it but we just	3811	A
a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him uh i get out of class at	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class	3811	A
you- know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home so for about_1 twenty minutes- twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
 um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
uh that makes a big difference	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yes	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists	3811	A
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university's uh uh department of um uh well- their Home Economics- Department	3811	A
um they uh they have a subbranch uh American Family Counseling and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus	3811	A
but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list so uh	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
well- it's best	3811	A
yeah a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
yes	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
it's amazing how much good things like uh Sesame Street will do	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
is uh	3811	A
<silence>	3811	A
	3811	B
yeah we have a	3811	B
two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh	3811	B
pretty reasonable price we think	3811	B
how about you do you have any children	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
oh boy	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
are you where are you student	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
no kidding	3811	B
i was a professor in a university here in California for a while	3811	B
yeah uh are you gonna uh put your son in child care in a a year or two	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
uh-huh	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
well that's a good experience i think and uh there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to	3811	B
uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found	3811	B
um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh that's more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier	3811	B
um facility um she goes to a home this is a um	3811	B
a couple uh emigrated from China early in in their lives they've been here probably thirty forty years they've got three daughters	3811	B
um and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them_1 in the afternoon	3811	B
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience i think- if it's good i think it's very good for the child	3811	B
and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year	3811	B
but um we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh	3811	B
just uh	3811	B
choose in the marketplace i don't know what it's like around uh Hattiesburg	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
uh-huh	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
i'll bet they're involved	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
yeah well that's uh i know it's it's a real uh hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities out here at Stanford they have a	3811	B
you know a a a real good facility and there uh is is quite a waiting list to get into that so it's uh	3811	B
you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and i think that it it really is buyer beware	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
well it is the best way to do it interestingly i think that um my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that um	3811	B
private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn because i think what we're gonna go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that	3811	B
uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh	3811	B
pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for	3811	B
uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life	3811	B
<silence>	3811	B
it's it's phenomenal it's phenomenal the the programming	3811	B
the human operating system is my area-	3811	B
	3873	B
uh i don't now my children are all grown but they did go through the Texas school system	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
	3873	B
uh yes but it was in a smaller town and uh it was in a town where i knew uh uh an awful lot of the people and kept track of them_1 and i think that made a difference i	3873	B
no they grew up in uh a town in uh north Texas in Sherman do you have children here	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
well i think Plano has a fairly good system because uh well just looking by the uh uh some of the scores coming out	3873	B
uh my children well now we did not uh they did not go to school until uh uh junior high but they were in Sherman Texas	3873	B
and one of my cousins was the principal but some of the problems i see now is i think uh	3873	B
some uh as i said my children have been out for quite a while but a lot of my friends have children and i can see a difference from between when my sons went through and what their children are doing and it seems to me that uh	3873	B
they're they're spending less and less uh	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
uh well my children had to have a lot more respect for their teachers than i think the- the- the students now days do	3873	B
and i think there is the uh	3873	B
that respect has has carried over and uh um they're they're not being taught respect	3873	B
uh	3873	B
unless and i don't know what you can do about it other than you know that is one of the the examples one of the examples i see	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
no i think also too you're you're right in the fact i think parents there is a lack of participation among parents it's uh too often the school is used as a dumping ground	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
yeah uh but you're right i hadn't thought about that but	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
but uh well also you know	3873	B
they they don't go	3873	B
to the open houses to the the parent teacher you know	3873	B
there's just a very small minority of of uh parents that do that	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
that is i think uh	3873	B
one of the things that i see course this is uh	3873	B
uh just- again an outsider view is too often that the school system is set up now uh based on the way it was for the last two hundred years on an an agrarian society uh culture	3873	B
and the life styles now like you said there are too many two parent uh working parents and uh a lot of them_1 work uh there is not your nine to five shifts there's a lot of shifts	3873	B
and it's a shame they cannot set up school systems that uh are not based on a Monday through Friday uh kind of you know a job	3873	B
or uh i wouldn't mind seeing evening you know uh utilizing- utilizing the schools uh opening up an evening uh	3873	B
you know a morning school and an evening school	3873	B
that way the the buildings would but now i am looking at other areas where they're having problems with over crowding and uh	3873	B
course you you'd have to have more teachers for that also but you could utilize the buildings just as well and it would be based on the life styles of their families	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
so that's a you know that's just a possibility	3873	B
and again i think also a lot of times they they	3873	B
there needs to be more emphasis on some of your basic education	3873	B
uh reading skills especially	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
oh yeah that's	3873	B
<silence>	3873	B
 do you have kids in the Texas schools	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
you know the way the question is worded it sounds like the person who made up the questions thinks there is something wrong the way they say is there something seriously wrong this- indicates that she thought that there was something wrong to begin with	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
did you like the schooling	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
so they didn't grow up in Irving	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
oh yeah	3873	A
yeah i sure do i have four uh well three of them are in school in the Plano schools and i really like the schools	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
yeah i think you're right	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
yeah that's such such a hard line because parents want to have control over their children	3873	A
you know so they want don't want anyone to discipline them and yet they also want this same person who doesn't have the authority to discipline them to command respect and the two don't go hand in hand	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
not only that but so many parents nowadays work and that's a low priority you know that is just some place that the kids go while they work	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
and so it's not like they have the time to sit and think about those kind of things because	3873	A
you know they have job career and you know and other things on their mind	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
that's right see my husband is the treasurer of the middle school that my daughter goes to and they're just always amazed at the lack of participation of the	3873	A
the parents and the things that they you know the programs that they try to put on and no one comes and they you know finally have kind of decided they're not interested and we i guess we shouldn't be either and that's kind of sad	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
um-hum	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
that's right	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
kind of a job	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
yeah yeah that's that's exactly right	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
see i've noticed with my elementary kids also that they want them_1 to grow up so fast	3873	A
<silence>	3873	A
you know that they want them_1 to have it's good to teach them_1 responsibility but boy the punishment	3873	A
	3810	B
oh okay well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing	3810	B
 and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh Plano Community Orchestra	3810	B
uh just you know different backgrounds it's been really kind of interesting	3810	B
 so um	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
oh yeah	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
oh they did	3810	B
 how did	3810	B
how did they get involved in that	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
oh how fun	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah that's nice you say have your four year old taking lessons already	3810	B
and uh who do you have her or him take it from	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
uh-huh	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
oh	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
well because_1 my	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
pardon me	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum um-hum	3810	B
well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of	3810	B
just turning five because_1 she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is	3810	B
is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally she just	3810	B
so i wasn't sure when to start her i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
yeah yeah	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum um-hum	3810	B
 yeah i think she'd like to i just don't know if it's really	3810	B
knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so	3810	B
 um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but	3810	B
um so yeah uh so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
 yeah	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
 oh that's good	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings from kids who come from a Suzuki method have you had any former Suzuki students	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
i was wondering how they-	3810	B
<silence>	3810	B
<silence>	3810	A
why don't you tell me about your choir	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
um-hum	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
great	3810	A
um i play the piano	3810	A
and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano	3810	A
he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby	3810	A
uh my husband and my other son who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at Music Man	3810	A
yeah and it was lots of fun	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
um	3810	A
basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions it was the Plano Repertory Theatre	3810	A
 and so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band	3810	A
so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school and my daughter takes piano lessons too	3810	A
but uh we just really like music it's a i- i especially like it as an outlet when the TV goes off we get the TV off and and just have some nice quiet music	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
um-hum	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki	3810	A
 which is an auditory type learning experience you listen to the music and then learn to play it by learning- by hearing the intervals and things like that	3810	A
i teach uh	3810	A
like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano	3810	A
but he can't learn like that he's a delayed child he's only about	3810	A
i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things	3810	A
and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it	3810	A
uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do something- do something you know educationally	3810	A
so that was really fun my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though	3810	A
so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
um	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
oh i think that's great	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
that's really hard i think because especially if you start them_1 and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something and they go i don't want to do this anymore and you're like	3810	A
God- i really want you to do it you know so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when but	3810	A
i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
uh-huh	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
that's like me	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
well it can get expensive that's for sure	3810	A
i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out	3810	A
yeah so it's been good for our family	3810	A
<silence>	3810	A
 i don't have any Suzuki students um	3810	A
something happening to me at Christmas time that that verified to me that i will always-	3810	A
	3882	A
i i don't have a lot of things that invade my every- everyday privacy probably the the one thing that i feel is a is a bother is uh soliciting over the phone	3882	A
from uh either for donations for different things or	3882	A
in the local area uh we have quite a bit of this i understand there's a a law now where some companies are unable to do this after the first of January but i haven't i really don't know too much about that but	3882	A
i really- other than that i don't really have anything that uh i feel invades my- my privacy how about you	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
 yeah	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
well that's- that's good uh i don't think	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
yes i	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
you bet and once you order something it seems like you get on their list and they send everything	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
that's	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh yeah	3882	A
uh that that's true and i don't know how you you stop that if you order anything at all	3882	A
and then use your credit card or get anything from any mail order catalogs or anything then everybody starts sending the stuff	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
right and i don't know what can be done about that but uh i'm sure that this is	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
well that's great that's good to hear i'll	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh well i have a son and uh	3882	A
hm yes well that that would be great i mean you know	3882	A
 yes it is like you say we're paying for it one way or the other	3882	A
and the postage and uh and	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
 we don't have a lot of that uh where i live uh very little but i would imagine that where you live in a larger area	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
well	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
it really would be and and then the that really invades it plus uh you- you just trying to settle down to do something and then uh here they come and they had	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
oh	3882	A
oh my goodness-	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
yes oh wow yeah	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
 i'm sure we must have um well i'm i'm sure we have a law in uh in Brigham City on that because uh we very- very seldom	3882	A
uh have anyone coming around but once in a while somebody will come in and then uh the word gets out and then nobody in the neighborhood will answer the door but uh	3882	A
we don't have maybe oh two or three times a year so there's there's got to be something uh i'm sure that that	3882	A
prohibits them from doing that	3882	A
	3882	A
but uh	3882	A
all of these are really irritants and things that we really don't need	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
yes	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
and uh	3882	A
<silence>	3882	A
that's true and then some of the advertisements on television some of the things uh that you might want or records or something i dare sent uh	3882	A
i dare sent order any of that stuff because then	3882	A
	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
i feel that the mail is also it's the telephones and the mails that get me i think the mails all these ads and things that they send and there should be a limit on that also	3882	B
not only financially but it's costing me and us really in advertising we're paying for all that junk that we throw in the	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
that's right and they have a and then you get your list there of privacy you know out of that comes the um and then then being able to use your name	3882	B
and that's invading your privacy to me now that is one of the biggest one another big one	3882	B
taking your name from lists	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
i know it is it's outrageous how you get the piles of it and uh and then even- it even- even gets to the point where they um	3882	B
oh they can mess up your credit bad with it you know as far as your with your um	3882	B
when you get on all these lists and all they can invade that part of it	3882	B
and	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
i know there is a number i think that or uh the post office you can send in a number and i don't have it myself in fact i thought of getting it my sister has it and said we she'd give it to me and she lives in Ohio	3882	B
and uh there is a number that you can send or a place that you can send to the post office and give them your address and tell them you don't want anymore of this and i just haven't done in fact she was just telling me about it recently	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
so i thought i might check with her on it and get that number and	3882	B
and have a lot of that junk mail stopped because_1 i really that	3882	B
it's a big irritant to me but	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
uh-huh we are	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
and door-to-door soliciting can be another	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
don't you	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
yeah it's a it's as much as a phone call you know invading your privacy and we do hear in a lot of it in Richardson there's quite a bit of it	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
yeah i did have to laugh though they had the um	3882	B
 they had the invasion of privacy law uh for weekends now here in Richardson they signed me to see uh	3882	B
on Saturdays and Sundays there is no soliciting allowed- allowed	3882	B
and they even stopped the little Brownies and Girl Scouts from selling their cookies and that really got us and we laughed about it because with one of the um editorials on it was	3882	B
it was great the guy went on about how the little Brownie came or Girl Scout came to the door and the police arrested her for selling their cookies and it was kind of a cute	3882	B
pun against that part of it but you know where do you stop it's true	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
really	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
oh really	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
uh-huh	3882	B
oh well that's good	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
uh-huh	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
now that's true and it is an invasion- and each time it's a breakdown of our system you know each one is a breakdown of our systems	3882	B
of your privacy- your own privacy	3882	B
that can be very irritable	3882	B
<silence>	3882	B
	3808	B
well	3808	B
unnecessary- a necessary evil i guess	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
well	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
yeah uh i guess i'm uh	3808	B
partly biased since we just recently our company's gone to the uh process of	3808	B
initiating drug testing on a random basis	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
everybody uh in the corporation	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
that's correct	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
well it's uh	3808	B
other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and	3808	B
and supervision taking the uh being done within the first year	3808	B
which we've all been done you know	3808	B
uh seems to be	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
the past year	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
uh right actually- late in ninety it was	3808	B
but you know they it's fairly infrequent it's just that it's there you know	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
oh Lord no i don't think uh	3808	B
first of all in my group	3808	B
hardly a fourth of them have been tested you know	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
uh it's about uh twenty people	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
well	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
that uh they want to you know social uh issues	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
yeah i think that	3808	B
that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
Texas Instruments	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
yeah	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
yeah i guess there uh	3808	B
may have been just a committee throwing out suggestions	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
it was uh it was received at our site here in Houston	3808	B
fairly easily however in Austin where they have a lot of engineers and uh	3808	B
i guess a younger set uh people they uh they were pretty uh a lot of people quit over it and uh quite a	3808	B
quite a bit of furor yeah	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
i guess yeah there was some people that just actually quit because of the	3808	B
their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
uh i don't know how much of that there is i don't think it's that big of an issue because they've hired a national company and it's you know handled	3808	B
third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
oh yes they've they've they've been people that have been uh	3808	B
the company has a	3808	B
you get a two step process the first time if you're caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if you're not you know	3808	B
still have to go into a program even	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user or whatever	3808	B
then uh after that first time- chance then the second time it's automatic termination so	3808	B
<silence>	3808	B
yeah well it's	3808	B
it's almost become a uh non topic anymore-	3808	B
<silence>	3808	A
what do you think about drug testing	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
yeah i think that it's appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and	3808	A
you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other people you know health professionals and people who	3808	A
uh operate machinery and fly and or drive whatever i think that those are really important i'm not sure how i feel about about other jobs just	3808	A
uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is	3808	A
drug free you know on on general principles	3808	A
but i can really see the justification for the others	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh for all job categories	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
so whether you're an executive behind a desk or you're operating a vehicle or whatever	3808	A
and- and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
so in the past month	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
oh since nineteen ninety one it started is that right	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
when you say infrequent is it maybe once a quarter or	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
how large is that group	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that	3808	A
that the company chose to do that	3808	A
was it insurance issue or	3808	A
safety issue	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
so uh on a performance level there was actually	3808	A
a problem with abuse of substances and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
yeah	3808	A
what kind of a company is it	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
oh i guess i should have figured anybody i talk to in Texas is- is probably from TI	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
interesting well	3808	A
they really i guess i shouldn't stray from the subject but they have some very interesting topics for for questions	3808	A
i often wonder who has created them	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
 was the response from the employees regarding drug testing favorable or	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
oh really	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
interesting quit on general principle	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
uh-huh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and	3808	A
be interpreted correctly	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
do you know if anyone's been uh	3808	A
 um	3808	A
disciplined or	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
so even if it's you know one time	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that	3808	A
	3808	A
<silence>	3808	A
 um what	3849	A
things are you looking for in a car what kind of car would you buy	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
for your next purchase	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
well it's funny because_1 i currently also have a Toyota Tercel	3849	A
um	3849	A
when i first got married my my father gave	3849	A
me and my wife a a	3849	A
a used Toyota um Corolla	3849	A
and we used that until we until it's about run into the ground and then we um bought a used um Toyota Tercel i was still a student at the time and um so	3849	A
um you bought what we could afford	3849	A
and	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
i think definitely um now we would also get a a larger car	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
oh	3849	A
very well	3849	A
um	3849	A
it um	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
did very well i mean	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
uh yeah it was about a hundred and fifty thousand and it may have gone further but um	3849	A
it was very reliable though- for us though	3849	A
um	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
oh that's to be expected i would think	3849	A
hopefully- hopefully it just doesn't happen at a a bad time i mean when you're far away from anything or something	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
uh-huh did you buy it new	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
i see but well sounds like it's been a good deal for you	3849	A
um	3849	A
another thing i may consider the main thing i look for in a car is reliability	3849	A
and	3849	A
um i just go by what my dad says he's a mechanic and i remember growing up and and but he's always- never wanted to spend a lot on a car because_1 i grew up in a fairly large family six kids and we just didn't have a lot of money to spend on cars	3849	A
so um i remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that and think they're the most unreliable cars that ever existed i mean ours broke down all the time luckily my dad was mechanic and he could fix them_1 but i remember	3849	A
he said- he said he would never buy um a foreign car but then in nineteen eighty he bought a used Toyota Corolla	3849	A
and i mean didn't even spend very much money for it i don't think he spent more than five hundred dollars for it but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased	3849	A
and he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time	3849	A
and so um	3849	A
but i don't know my feeling is that American cars to keep up at all are becoming more reliable also so i may consider buying um an American made car	3849	A
my next my next purchase	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
that's true	3849	A
i have a cousin- yeah one of my cousins	3849	A
is trying to tell convince me that um	3849	A
the American made cars are becoming reliable- reliable but	3849	A
uh i'm not i'm not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good	3849	A
um and reliable that that i've i've used	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
oh	3849	A
<silence>	3849	A
	3849	A
i'm in Iowa City Iowa very small town and i don't i don't know if there's even uh more than a	3849	A
one or two a month i mean um that's that that's not a big consideration here and i just moved from Utah where i that's where i was going to school before and um	3849	A
also there um there's i've never had that concern	3849	A
um so i'm not really i'm not really sure	3849	A
	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
well right now i have a uh small Toyota Tercel	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
and i think next time i want something just a little bit bigger uh perhaps mid size i really don't don't like the the real big cars	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
i'm thinking about maybe a Volvo	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
you do	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
uh-huh	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
right	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
how did your uh Corolla hold up	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
for real	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
do you remember how many miles you had on it in the at the end	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
my my Tercel now has a hundred and forty six thousand miles on it	3849	B
and i really haven't had any trouble out of it except the alternator went out at about a hundred and twenty six thousand miles i think	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
right	3849	B
right	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
right and um it's really been great i have had no problems with it you know except little little minor things like you know belts and course you know	3849	B
actually i didn't i bought it from um Hertz Rent A Car and it had like twenty six thousand miles on it when i bought it	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
right	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
yeah	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
uh-huh	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
wow	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
 right	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
uh	3849	B
wow	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
yeah i'm trying to consider that uh that could do to the plight of General Motors and all of that	3849	B
i'm really trying trying to consider	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
but i don't know i- i- i don't want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
have you heard that uh or do you know anything about the foreign cars being easier to steal than the uh the American cars	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
because_1 there's a lot of of um car theft going going on in Dallas right now i don't know about in your area	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
yeah	3849	B
<silence>	3849	B
	3822	A
uh well we're right between uh Milwaukee and Chicago	3822	A
so there's there's just been a big Coke bust uh here because i think people pass through	3822	A
you know on their way back and forth through the bigger cities	3822	A
um it's it's okay i mean there's crime everywhere it it's	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
probably not	3822	A
it's not you know the	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
best place	3822	A
to be but	3822	A
yeah it's right next to Racine	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
oh really	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
uh	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
yeah-	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
oh yeah it's like ten minutes away from me	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
	3822	A
no	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
really it's that bad	3822	A
the crime- because of the crime	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
wow	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
with the	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
oh yeah	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
no it's not	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
it	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
it yeah it's gotten worse too nothing's getting better	3822	A
seems like it's always getting worse	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
i think it has to get worse first before it can get better	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
they need something and it	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
i heard uh Dallas cops are really strict like	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
oh yeah	3822	A
whoa	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
yeah same here certain parts of our city uh you just don't go by you just don't	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
because_1 then you're asking for trouble	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
twenty one	3822	A
yep	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
twenty three	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
yeah uh	3822	A
actually uh my sister lives in Racine	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
it's bigger than Kenosha by a little bit and their crime rate's crime rate's a lot worse than ours	3822	A
yeah they just some guy uh couple months ago he got out a machete did you read about that and started just hacking people in the street with it	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
oh that was in Racine	3822	A
 it's sad i mean you can't even drive or walk down the street at night or anything	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
i've heard of that	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
uh-huh	3822	A
<silence>	3822	A
<silence>	3822	B
uh how- how's the crime rate up there	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
okay	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
uh-huh	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
yeah	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
right	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
is it anywhere near Racine	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
really my uh old old girlfriend uh was from there	3822	B
yeah uh actually i went- i went and saw her about four years ago her parents had moved to Chicago and uh	3822	B
at this point they had moved out of Dallas and everything then they had moved back and she was going to school down here and i went and saw her one summer and uh we went up there	3822	B
i never been up there i just remember	3822	B
it's a different area from down here obviously but uh	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
uh so you're a cheese head huh yeah well we're i mean down here i mean Dallas i mean this crime rate's ridiculous i mean it's just	3822	B
i'm getting ready to move actually in the probably the next year or so so i mean but	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
it's it yeah i mean it isn't Washington DC but it's there's just so many uh	3822	B
i mean we've had like four or five uh since school started like uh in high school people uh	3822	B
incidents where kids shooting you know a teacher or you know since you know the school year and everything like New Year's Eve there were three people shot right away i mean like in the first ten minutes of the new year you know so	3822	B
it's just been it's ridiculous there's a lot of problems right now i mean the uh	3822	B
the police chief out here is the former assistant police chief uh Darryl Gates in LA	3822	B
so i mean he's not like you know beating up anybody but	3822	B
there's just it's a big city and it's what you know you get and there's there's just getting a lot it's getting overcrowded and there's a lot of uh	3822	B
immigrants from uh Mexico and stuff so	3822	B
it's it's it's getting pretty ridiculous	3822	B
but uh	3822	B
i'm sure you know since you're near Chicago i'm sure you could	3822	B
it's not exactly a peaceful city either you know	3822	B
so it's the same situation really	3822	B
so i'm actually in Richardson which is just north of Dallas it's a little suburb	3822	B
but	3822	B
yeah i mean	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
yeah i don't see how it can get better i mean it's got to totally	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
yeah stricter laws or something that	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
uh	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
if i could solve problems i'd be a rich person but guess i can't	3822	B
i'm just it's one of those deals where i mean you know try to look at you know look at at other countries what they do but i mean we're not like barbarics uh i don't	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
you know it's just too many problems with uh people getting paroled before- uh you know early and coming out committing another crime while they're still on probation we've had a lot of problems out here with that course	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
well it's it's kind of yeah they shoot first then ask questions later you know that's that's their motto	3822	B
they're they're not uh	3822	B
you got to be careful if i mean i never had a problem i mean i'm not like	3822	B
hang- just you just don't hang out in Dallas or you got to be you know where not to be at night and the you know	3822	B
just are certain places you don't even	3822	B
certain parts of town you just stay away from you know	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
right and you just	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
yeah you just leave it alone i mean	3822	B
oh yeah oh	3822	B
how old are you	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
twenty one yeah	3822	B
oh i'm twenty three	3822	B
yeah uh	3822	B
that's pretty wild right next to Racine huh	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
really	3822	B
God i never thought i would ever run into somebody	3822	B
look i'll read the paper every now and then and something Racine Wisconsin will pop out you know but yeah it's just kind of a little town um	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
really	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
with- with the machete no i didn't hear about that	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
God	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
well uh in Wheaton Illinois where her parents live and that's where that uh	3822	B
<silence>	3822	B
yeah it's just like forty five miles outside of Chicago and few years ago i guess there was some uh	3822	B
i think it was some	3822	B
um some lady was like shot- uh	3822	B
killed- attacked some school children-	3822	B
<silence>	3899	B
uh-huh	3899	B
okay	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that we're we're doing way too much of that although i'm not sure	3899	B
the one thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whether- how whether that's a very serious one or not um	3899	B
you know uh with	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
well that's what i've heard it kills me because i love fires and i and i really really care about pollution and i don't use anything that's got the the the stuff- stuff- the	3899	B
stuff in it you know the spray bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but that's the one thing that i think is	3899	B
very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural	3899	B
that's a that's a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but	3899	B
	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
that that that's what they have yeah but um i you know i- i am really concerned about it because you can you're beginning to- well you're beginning to see the air	3899	B
and and that's frightening and i know in California uh a whole lot is being done i don't know how well that's working and if all those things all those laws went through	3899	B
about about the for the car manufacturers and everything and- has that do you know	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
yeah	3899	B
uh-huh	3899	B
but i think what they're gonna do is try to get the try to get the car manufacturers to make cars that you know use gasoline more- more- uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
yes i think that's right i think that's right but it's scary what it's doing to to stone buildings	3899	B
you know the the acid rain i mean destroying things trees are dying lot of forests are are dying of these uh in Canada and in in uh	3899	B
i don't know about_1 i don't know about_1 in California	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
um-hum um-hum	3899	B
yeah well and- and i had not experienced it as much my son went to Pomona and he went	3899	B
the school starts in the fall and that is the notorious smog season so when he first went out there about five- you know five-	3899	B
uh a long time ago four or five years ago but anyway he- he called and just said mother now i know what they're talking about i mean this stuff you really feel you can't breathe	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
uh-huh	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
yeah yeah yeah	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
no i know and and as far as what i you know i do things about almost everything else but as far as the air is concerned i am trying to buy a new car but there are no cars available with clean fuel	3899	B
so i can't do that um i just	3899	B
yeah yeah	3899	B
uh yeah i would too but that and it it's not affordable and it's not out there	3899	B
and then i have stopped using anything but pump sprays so that i'm trying to get i'm trying not to use that whatever that's called chlorofluorocarbons-	3899	B
some kind of anyway that's that's hurting the ozone uh level i'm trying not to do that	3899	B
	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
oh no no no i didn't either yes	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
yeah	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
yeah but	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
no and i i'm not sure i'm not sure that this is something that air pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of the other ones	3899	B
uh like recycling or even water you know water use or saving water and that's what's scary to me	3899	B
<silence>	3899	B
large companies that's right industry and the car manufacturers	3899	B
and uh that we have less control i guess it depends on who we vote for and how we write	3899	B
you know write letters to them	3899	B
<silence>	3899	A
okay i pushed it	3899	A
so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah well you know what i was talking to my brother in Denver	3899	A
and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah i couldn't believe-	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
 yeah i can't understand-	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah i just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places that's all that all the heat they have in their home	3899	A
you know	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
well i know yeah isn't that terrible	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
well i don't know all i know is that we have to have our car- our car smogged every two years you know and um	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just they don't wanna they wanna use uh	3899	A
you know something that's gonna burn all this gas where we can buy more gas you know	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um um-hum um-hum	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
 well i don't know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down Southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this	3899	A
crud you know it oh it's terrible	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah it- it- it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these trucks that's on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those trucks just smoke like heck you know	3899	A
but it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
no the electric cars i think that was a good idea i would really go for that	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah right right	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
 i	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum um-hum	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
um-hum um-hum	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that we're gonna be in the house all day	3899	A
you know and it's just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i don't use mine	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
yeah right-	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
right right	3899	A
yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large companies and uh-huh	3899	A
right- right right right so	3899	A
<silence>	3899	A
	3899	A
	3825	B
well this is an unusual topic what do you think about it	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
well that sounds great Ellen how far away do they come from right	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
oh okay	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
oh okay that makes sense nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
um-hum	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
yeah	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
that's interesting you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this then	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
southern California's still pretty large	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
i see	3825	B
and	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
yeah	3825	B
well my experience um	3825	B
has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family uh	3825	B
years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side and uh	3825	B
they haven't had a reunion since then they just show up at funerals and weddings	3825	B
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that but anyway my mother's side	3825	B
we had our our first real reunion that i've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some- some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and	3825	B
uh they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and	3825	B
people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and you know a lot of that sort of thing since it was the first one that we'd had	3825	B
the you- you could do that once now next time we have one we'll have to think of something more creative to do	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
oh	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
not a passion huh	3825	B
um	3825	B
i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy and i- i suspect we will do more of it	3825	B
um i found out some about some of the relatives i didn't you know i- i didn't even know their names some of the	3825	B
two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and	3825	B
uh there's a lot of things there you have to stop they're really kind of fascinating i found out my grandmother was one of a twin and we don't even know where the twin	3825	B
we have virtually no	3825	B
no background on on her on the twin	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
uh my grandmother's uh	3825	B
sister	3825	B
who would be somewhere in in West Virginia i'm sure she's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
i'm i'm quite a bit i'm probably a lot older than you are	3825	B
um	3825	B
<silence>	3825	B
i don't know	3825	B
	3825	A
yeah i at first i it took eight times to find you- you so i told my husband um you know what should i say and then he reminded me but um	3825	A
um his- in his family uh what they usually do on his dad's side his mom or um the aunts will send out little postcards	3825	A
like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the	3825	A
where to meet and you know just to bring anything and so they just notify everyone by mail and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short um	3825	A
or a small um dinner type thing	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
um they come from	3825	A
well they all meet in Portland and they come as far as oh Seattle and and sometimes we've gone and we were from- we were living in Utah at the time	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
and um but his his dad's family is all around the area and	3825	A
his mom's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern Utah and people would come from Seattle to there and um	3825	A
let's see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and they would	3825	A
um assign a different person each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
yeah yeah and the people who are down there like they'll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area and that person can call	3825	A
you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too	3825	A
and then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone's sort of involved	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
oh well that's my husband's side and my mom's my mom's or my family- family uh we- we all live in southern California so we just have to either call or	3825	A
give a formal invite and we're all there so	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
 yeah well i mean LA Orange County area i mean everyone's you know mostly not farther than an hour away	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
uh-huh	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
 oh	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
wow	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
well you know that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband's	3825	A
mother's side together is um they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and everyone- inevitably everyone is just	3825	A
very interested and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that and so everyone has to update their little	3825	A
books or whatever	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
um uh i do but not to very much compared to my mother-in-law	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
oh	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
oh	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
really is that your your grandma's own sibling and she	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
oh i see oh so	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
well maybe um they just moved away and then just sort of lost contact and	3825	A
<silence>	3825	A
	3831	B
okay uh	3831	B
yeah Middle East and	3831	B
	3831	B
yeah i guess last week was the uh anniversary of everything but uh	3831	B
that's that's one of those messed up areas i mean it's just	3831	B
i i i think that the whole operation- you know the idea of peace ever being achieved over there is just kind of a	3831	B
i don't know i mean that we're going to have peace you can have maybe some- little more stability that what they have right now but	3831	B
it's just that's pure hatred between the Israelis and the uh Arabs i mean it's just	3831	B
i just don't think they can coexist i mean because they're not ever going to you know	3831	B
it's just too many problems that	3831	B
<silence>	3831	B
right	3831	B
<silence>	3831	B
uh-huh	3831	B
<silence>	3831	B
yeah i'm i'm amazed uh Israel didn't even uh	3831	B
you know retaliate that that that's one of the most surprising things	3831	B
i'm but	3831	B
<silence>	3831	B
yeah in fact Baker was uh	3831	B
a speech yesterday trying to get them back they're supposed to be going back to tables pretty soon the next week or two i think but	3831	B
uh they'll you know they'll work out some type of an agreement and something will pop up in about five years and	3831	B
the fact that we never got uh Hussein out hopefully that will fall apart on its own in the next year or so but	3831	B
i mean if he ever gets any type of military power back i mean for that area that's just going to be same situation again and	3831	B
i don't know Bush	3831	B
i just think should have gone in and just take- take him out that would have that was a major problem	3831	B
just him being just	3831	B
he's powerless but still the fact that he's still in power it's over there that's a symbol of	3831	B
he stood up to the evil force of the western world and i mean that's just completely different mode of thinking and	3831	B
to them what they view- view as reality is just simply opposite of what we view but	3831	B
so i it's	3831	B
i just i don't know the only thing that keeps us there is the oil and i guess the only good thing that came out of it is we would be paying twice as much more now for gas but	3831	B
<silence>	3831	B
i mean	3831	B
<silence>	3831	B
well it is for the money makers out there i guess but	3831	B
i don't know it's it's kind of hard for me to really	3831	B
imagine i mean i've never even been over in that part of the world and i had a friend of mine that got back and	3831	B
he's sort of there and he's just said that he just really he couldn't stand the the	3831	B
uh Saudis at all because_1 he said they just didn't have any respect for them at all and just	3831	B
yeah- they didn't	3831	B
he just really had a hard time you know	3831	B
you know i- i look at it as a he looked at it as a job he wasn't like	3831	B
because_1 he didn't like the people and no one did he said they just didn't they didn't want them over there the people they didn't like them and	3831	B
you know they had all these rules you couldn't bring any type of religious artifacts in or	3831	B
any type of alcohol anything like that he's just	3831	B
and they they have like this they look down at the soldiers- the American soldiers and he said it's just	3831	B
you have a hard time you know fighting for their cause	3831	B
and to me to it's i don't know it's just it's just totally backward everything you know black is white and	3831	B
white is black to them i mean that doesn't make sense but	3831	B
<silence>	3831	B
	3831	A
yeah uh well you know it's really ironic because it's just about a year ago today we were involved you know actively in that war that was going on at this time and uh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
yeah yeah uh-huh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
um	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
yeah well it it it certainly is not a an easy situation to deal with but uh i uh i i remember last year when the war was going on that i actually was uh if one can be	3831	A
in any way relieved when a war is going on but at least Israel listened to the uh admonitions of the United States about not retaliating uh when those missiles were dropped on them	3831	A
and amazingly we we had those weapons that would counteract those missiles so that they would do a minimal of damage uh the whole thing was very amazing to me i don't think any any of it is right i mean we should be doing any of that stuff	3831	A
oh it's such an misuse of what we are as people but under the circumstances i could not help thinking that probably uh you know five or ten years ago i don't i don't even think that same kind of uh	3831	A
respect uh sufficiently for the United States would have been there that Israel wouldn't have just gone ahead you know uh like that uh	3831	A
Arafat and the and the the P L O and everything would just you know be so rambunctious as to just	3831	A
to retaliate and even- even cause worse damage oh it was a very terrible thing but uh it's uh hm hm	3831	A
uh-huh they did	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
yeah well i guess you know so long as our uh missile systems were holding out to counteract what was being thrown in and things seemed to be working i guess it's	3831	A
it's really worth trying for peace or at least coexistence like you said uh and they have actually gone to peace talks uh since the time of that war to try to	3831	A
hit some kind of a a common ground for coexistence uh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
yeah uh-huh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
oh sure	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
um	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
yeah well it amazes me that the guy is still there yeah yeah is not around	3831	A
very strange uh-huh	3831	A
you know	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
um	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
oh well that's hopefully not the essential issue to mankind but uh	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah uh-huh	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
oh really yeah	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
mentality like	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
oh really	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
oh	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
hm	3831	A
um	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
oh that's right that's right	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
oh that that's in Arabia	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
um	3831	A
ah	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
<silence>	3831	A
well it makes you wonder how- how	3831	A
 planned a family reunion recently	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
you know i really haven't and i know of friends who've done it recently and have really enjoyed um	3817	A
the the planning process but uh most of our family see each other fairly frequently so it's it's uh you know not a a major event to to try and plan it because we're all fairly close um	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
that's wonderful	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
oh that's great	3817	A
so your great-grandfather was still living and everyone up to that point was invited	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
uh-huh wow	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
uh-huh	3817	A
that's wonderful two hundred people who organized it who was the one that instigated the the planning process	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
i was gonna ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
now given the size of the group were there people were most of the families fairly large is that what contributed to that	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
 that's great	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
that's wonderful i'm sure that was a wonderful experience for the kids too and even if they didn't appreciate it at the moment they'll probably really appreciate it later	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
no uh uh	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
 yeah my folks uh moved from Michigan to San Diego and that's where they raised the three of us my daughter my sisters and myself	3817	A
 but uh	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
i would expect yeah yeah	3817	A
and i know that my grandparents' families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother	3817	A
so we've kept in touch those first cousins very pretty closely um i'm not quite sure how i'd even pursue finding the rest of the folks in Michigan	3817	A
i think i think each of my grandparents had ten siblings	3817	A
so	3817	A
there's got to be a few of those second does that make second cousin or third cousin i'm not sure	3817	A
	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
oh okay okay	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great	3817	A
aunts and uncles	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
 right right	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
did you find that you had a lot in common did people find out things about each other that they hadn't been aware	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
 really	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
uh-huh	3817	A
<silence>	3817	A
	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
the last family reunion i did not plan i only participated and enjoyed about two years ago	3817	B
how about_1 you	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
it often depends how far you want to go back on- on our particular family reunion they went back to my great-great-grandfather	3817	B
so that it was quite um spread out and there were many families um and there were many people we didn't know i think the total participation i don't know how many were invited but there were about two hundred and fifty people there	3817	B
and some of the families one of the cutest things that some of the the families- families did was to get T-shirts that identified themselves as that branch of the family	3817	B
it was fun	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
 actually he was not he has gone but they decided to go ahead and take the family reunion back that far so that it wouldn't just be people meeting third cousins but people meeting i guess	3817	B
whatever fifth and seventh cousins	3817	B
and the other thing that i thought was particularly fun was uh the huge they had a huge family tree uh that was posted so you could sort of everybody could sort of see who married whom and	3817	B
so that was fun	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
you know in every family there's usually one person that is gifted to do these things i have a cousin who never marries who is a librarian sounds like a bad novel	3817	B
um and she did she was she's always been interested in genealogy and she's kind of kept track and so	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
 um i think she just started out writing to	3817	B
key people in the different branches of families and asking them to contact everyone and i really on the family tree there really was everyone except there was just some one group that had sort of gotten lost	3817	B
in Missouri but this is was in Indiana and it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in one area	3817	B
so it wasn't like they were necessarily from all over the country but	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
 we're a good Catholic German stock and so yes	3817	B
the original family that i eluded to my great-grandfather had twelve children and they had some pictures of that- that was another thing they did that i thought was fun	3817	B
 sounds like the twelve tribes of Israel or something	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
that's always true they remember most the games they had lots of games and competitions which were fun well are you planning a family reunion	3817	B
oh	3817	B
do you how your relatives- you're from San you're in San Francisco	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
sometimes when you've moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
this is a little office	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
that sounds	3817	B
 typical	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
 i never knew that i- i always i thought the children- like the children of your first cousins i always called those second cousins and my children and my cousins' children i called third cousins	3817	B
that's how i've always named it some people have this once removed stuff and i don't know what that means	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
they'd just be your great-aunts great-aunt your grandparents' siblings would be your great aunts and uncles	3817	B
 and	3817	B
so but it it is interesting sometimes a little sad when families branch out quite so much but i don't know that's the American way	3817	B
<silence>	3817	B
 i had two distant relatives who lived in the Dallas Fort Worth area that- that i never had met and didn't know they were here and we we all laughed how it was funny to go back to Indiana to meet people who lived	3817	B
ten miles from you so that was sort of funny in fact one of them it's like my father-	3817	B
i don't remember how this was i guess it was actually just my father's cousin so it's not all that far away turns out he even goes to our church here in Dallas so	3817	B
	3839	A
yes sir	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
well uh you mean that i did or had done	3839	A
either one well actually um this whole past summer i've had my old outside of my house repainted	3839	A
and a lot of the little minor wood things corrected	3839	A
and just prior to that i had a a bathroom totally remodeled and rebuilt and uh so i've i'm bringing my house up-to-date really	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
we built the house in nineteen sixty	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
no	3839	A
that's right they they- they do change and and the bathrooms you know if you have any water leakage anywhere can uh slowly deteriorate things and so you got to plug those leaks up	3839	A
	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
is that right well- is the water level high there	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
oh well we just got about a an inch inch and a half last night	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
	3839	A
oh i see	3839	A
	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
oh i see are you doing this yourself	3839	A
	3839	A
	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
	3839	A
i declare oh well	3839	A
	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
uh-huh	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
that's true these lot of fellows uh uh really- really want to work pretty hard so they willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices i'm sure of that i just had some guttering also replaced on my home	3839	A
uh i actually replaced all the other guttering last year and and the piece that i did this year seemed all right at the time so i left it alone	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
that's what i put up this last time it's one solid piece about thirty feet long	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
 no it was uh brought out on a truck	3839	A
so i i- it was it- i have seen these things done they uh they come on great big large wheels i think of material and they roll it off	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
yeah	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
well this as i say this was already uh they had come out and measured it and brought out the two pieces at the correct length and all they had to do is mount them and then uh seal one joint where the two ends came together	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
uh-huh	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
worked all right huh	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
	3839	A
that's very very close i	3839	A
as they say down south you done good	3839	A
	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
yeah	3839	A
<silence>	3839	A
well that sounds great	3839	A
yeah well i've got this uh the we were talking earlier about my house i've got one more bathroom to rebuild and uh	3839	A
we also have a a a porch that extends out from our master bedroom that we want to rebuild it's uh taken a beating over the years and um now we're a little afraid to walk out on it because some of the wood is deteriorating	3839	A
uh we're in between the mountains we're we're in uh what we're called Nitny Valley at Penn State i	3839	A
	3839	B
hey Larry what is the last home repair job you did	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
had the either one	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
um-hum you-	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
how old is your house	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
well that's not that old of a house but things do change from time to time don't they	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
y'all have basements in Pennsylvania don't you	3839	B
we don't have basements in Texas unless it's an unusual- a very unusual situation	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
uh no we build them_1 on pier and beams as they- up for few years back and then what's popular now is just called a slab	3839	B
and we don't have snow to speak of	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
if it snows in Dallas we won't- we don't go to work and wait for it to melt and at lunch we have the day off you know it i'm serious we just we don't have any snow plows	3839	B
uh the last home project i guess well a year and a half ago we bought a house that had laid vacant for about two years and had been	3839	B
well sad situation estate thing and we've kind of put the whole thing back together uh the biggest thing i did was uh refenced and redecked in the back	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
are you kidding	3839	B
i'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a hammer and a nail it wouldn't be straight anyway	3839	B
uh	3839	B
let's see and we- we found a part time fireman and policeman and in their so- so called spare time they moonlight	3839	B
and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow page advertised uh	3839	B
personnel	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
um-hum	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now	3839	B
no kidding	3839	B
were you were you happy- did they make it right there on your property	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
oh okay	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
i haven't seen it done when we moved into the uh the house we	3839	B
we got guttering bids we finally repaired briefly what we've got for less than a hundred bucks those guys were gonna sell me a three thousand	3839	B
	3839	B
go ahead and uh they talked about bringing a machine out and just making it right there in the front yard and putting it up as they make it so i've never seen one	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
i just thought of a project i did my wife wanted an island in the kitchen	3839	B
well we the house isn't that new so i built a uh	3839	B
	3839	B
a uh	3839	B
a table	3839	B
from the local hardware store we have a outfit called Home Depot which is probably local down here but i ordered a Formica top with rounded corners	3839	B
and then they have premade and bevelled uh legs and braces and so i simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces and and uh put it together and uh	3839	B
for and it worked just fine it was premeasured- the legs were premeasured exactly the same length so it's level hold it i have to put two business cards underneath it that's pretty damn close for an amateur	3839	B
uh	3839	B
 yeah had somebody come through and he said my gosh if you had bought that at a store it'd been seven hundred and fifty dollars and i got out for about a hundred and forty five i think	3839	B
so i was happy	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
um-hum	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
how nice	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
are y'all in the mountains	3839	B
<silence>	3839	B
<silence>	3889	A
 okay well have you had to return anything lately	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
uh oh	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
uh-huh	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
um	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
yeah we haven't had to take anything back although i wonder you know if they	3889	A
sometimes i think things are made to not last as long as they used to you know so you have to buy them_1 more often uh	3889	A
and my phone is making a weird noise um	3889	A
i'm trying to think we have we just moved into our house about two years ago and we had to buy um	3889	A
refrigerator and washer and dryer and all that and so far we haven't had any	3889	A
any major problems haven't had although i keep hearing noises this morning that make me wonder if our washer is about to to uh you know	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
oh uh-huh	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
huh	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
oh	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
hum	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
oh	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
 oh	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
um wow what a mess-	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
yeah	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
right	3889	A
<silence>	3889	A
oh they could make lots of bucks that way oh we haven't had any	3889	A
we haven't had to have anything fixed like that although we do my husband orders a lot from Land's End um catalog	3889	A
yeah yeah we've we've had real good luck with them for the most part but they have changed their sizing somewhat and because_1 i had ordered a women's blouse and i wear about a six but i usually like to order the next size up	3889	A
and i had ordered a um uh one of those little polo shirts um	3889	A
and it's really pretty small and i hardly ever wear it but so i was trying to decide what size to order this time and i went ahead and ordered the same size	3889	A
	3889	A
	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
well yes i did i returned a number of things yesterday at uh JC Penney but-	3889	B
but it wasn't um it was clothing	3889	B
and um	3889	B
the blouse was uh supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my shoulder and it wasn't you know the style of the blouse it just	3889	B
i think it was sized wrong but you know it was a nice blouse but and um i took some uh lingerie back that wasn't	3889	B
well i the size that i usually buy did not fit in their in their brand it was too small	3889	B
uh but as far as large items go like appliances or things like that no	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
uh-huh	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
um um-hum	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
well uh i would like to comment on my washer um	3889	B
um my washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise	3889	B
and you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced	3889	B
but um it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really	3889	B
and i he says let me show you and i said- i said oh yeah i see that it really needs something bad you know but it didn't uh have an affect on the performance of the machine	3889	B
what what it was the um it was a cap after your um	3889	B
after the body of the machine was in place it was under that so it wasn't visible	3889	B
and it was out of sight	3889	B
and it was rusting out	3889	B
although i don't have any rust in my clothes and i said okay how much do you want to	3889	B
uh do this repair work and he told me almost two hundred and fifty dollars and i said hey i can go buy a new one for that price	3889	B
and i said- and i said no i'm not gonna do that i said the performance of the machine is not affected by that part	3889	B
and i said and that's not that's not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in	3889	B
and um so that was two years ago and my machine is still functioning fine	3889	B
	3889	B
so i didn't you know and he wanted thirty five dollars for a service call and i says hey wait a minute they didn't tell me that when i called and i said i'm not paying it	3889	B
i says if they had told me up front i would have paid it but since they did not say ma'am there's a thirty five dollar service call	3889	B
but they didn't and i says i refuse to pay it and so he he had called his office and told them what i said and i- i was released from that service charge	3889	B
so you know they were they to me that was underhanded i wouldn't have minded if they had said okay uh we have that service is thirty five dollars or whatever they they charge maybe it's different um	3889	B
uh charges for different things i don't know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything	3889	B
and then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever you've got wrong with your	3889	B
you write them_1	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
yeah they really could	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
yes	3889	B
oh they're a fantastic company to deal with	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
oh uh-huh	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
um-hum	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
um-hum	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
oh my	3889	B
<silence>	3889	B
	3856	A
what experience have you had with family reunions	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
huh that's really good	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
yeah my mom my mom's family is all	3856	A
	3856	A
my family is really scattered out so if we didn't have family reunions we simply would never see each other for example um	3856	A
 my	3856	A
my parents live in Seattle Washington	3856	A
however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from Utah	3856	A
and all of my dad's uh relatives and family are from Oregon so we we usually have family reunions once a year and we'll go to Utah and uh	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
go to Oregon um	3856	A
	3856	A
my mom puts a big deal into the family reunion when they go to Utah um and um	3856	A
she sometimes plans them and and sometimes helps in planning them usually um Southern Utah is so hot that um we pick there's the	3856	A
they rent out this cabin that's up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get some- the cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time	3856	A
and that's what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also	3856	A
uh	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
yeah	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
yeah i know at the the family reunions on my dad's side that we go to in Oregon um we usually um	3856	A
have it at a park and so you know swimming is always part of one of the activities so	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
oh there's a there's a family reunion- reunion um once a year um	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
for for each for my father's side and for my mother's side i know and my wife also um	3856	A
so they try when they have family reunions they don't have them as regularly but when they do they try and make big deal out of it and usually have you know something like a talent show or	3856	A
um each family um does something	3856	A
um	3856	A
yeah	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
yeah my mom- my grandma also has some	3856	A
we haven't particularly shown those at the reunions but my grandma has some home movies and we ever whenever we go to her house we like to	3856	A
see those those are	3856	A
you know nice for memories	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
<silence>	3856	A
	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
well actually uh oh the last eight or ten years i have	3856	B
an aunt and i i should say have like done our family reunion	3856	B
and uh oh you know we send out letters to everybody and we rent a place in this uh savings and loan in a in a little town	3856	B
and uh then everybody brings a covered dish and that sort of thing and uh	3856	B
it's real nice because my mother uh	3856	B
had seven brothers and sisters and if we didn't do this like the cousins would never see each other the aunts and uncles um that's the type family reunion we've had there you know	3856	B
so uh	3856	B
you know if we found you know the years we don't do that nobody- nobody sees each other because everybody lives in different places you know	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
oh	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
oh	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
uh-huh yeah everybody fixes their specialty or whatever	3856	B
yeah well it really in your case and mine too uh i guess in most everybody's as far as especially more distant relatives you know uh cousins aunts and uncles and so on	3856	B
you just wouldn't see them if you didn't do something like that	3856	B
well my immediate family like on my side uh has gotten large because there's four of us and now we've all had children and now we all have grandchildren	3856	B
so that makes just my immediate family like thirty people so we do a separate reunion and we have a lake house uh about seventy miles from here	3856	B
so we we've done it once we all get together down there	3856	B
and um that works out real well because there's a lot	3856	B
well lot of things everybody can do they can fish or they can you know swim or things like that	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
well it really doesn't much matter where or how you do it as long as you manage to do it every how often did like your families up there have them	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
yeah	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
yeah we have taken like old home movies from you know twenty five thirty years ago and and shown them at the family reunion	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
uh-huh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago uh there's places now that do that	3856	B
and uh it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get about thirty or forty old reels you know	3856	B
on there and it and then you can skip around and find what you want and all that it really has uh worked out good	3856	B
<silence>	3856	B
so uh	3856	B
so how did you get on the TI thing	3856	B
	3821	A
well	3821	A
credit cards	3821	A
	3821	A
i'll tell you what i i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because_1	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
i uh tore mine up	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
yeah uh i got in some problems with uh	3821	A
financial problems because of credit cards so i	3821	A
uh basically just got rid of all of them i i have a a couple i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and	3821	A
you know uh one that i use just for	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
emergencies but	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
i know it	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
oh is that right that's a that's a good policy	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
yeah uh sometimes i wish i had them but in most cases i'm glad i don't because_1 i you know unfortunately i i-	3821	A
i don't have the control you have i wish i did but but i don't uh and it you know it i just don't want to get into that situation again so we'll	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
oh that's it see and that's even with my gas card you know i find that i'll go in to get some gas and i'll end up buying you know	3821	A
candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and i'm thinking what did i get	3821	A
that costs so much	3821	A
and	3821	A
	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
that that's true but i can i can understand- certainly understand where	3821	A
you know	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
oh yeah isn't it that's unbelievable how let me ask you this how how old are you	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
thirty three	3821	A
okay	3821	A
 you'll be thirty three this year	3821	A
 you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh	3821	A
	3821	A
it's coming	3821	A
yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates it's uh it's unbelievable	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
oh jeez	3821	A
	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
yeah and then you bet	3821	A
that's uh yeah i in fact i've i've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less	3821	A
uh rates	3821	A
and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know	3821	A
and i i guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh	3821	A
call you know if you've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating	3821	A
you can call your in you know your your card uh wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or i'll just go to somewhere else	3821	A
you know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good uh	3821	A
uh history with them	3821	A
they're more than willing to do that	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
yeah in fact that's that's what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says that's you know he's tried it several- with several of his cards and he's just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank	3821	A
at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent	3821	A
it does not make sense for me to do that and if you won't drop my rates i'll just go ahead and send you back your card and i'll go somewhere else and get it	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
<silence>	3821	A
	3821	B
yeah	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
is that right i i know people- i know some other people that have done that	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
um	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
yeah i have- i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were	3821	B
they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies and	3821	B
they're still paying away to get out of debt	3821	B
 but	3821	B
no i did just the opposite i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh	3821	B
parents' footsteps i have quite a few of them i use them continually	3821	B
but i uh i basically never charge anything i don't have the money in the bank to pay for	3821	B
and uh and i always pay them off totally every month yeah	3821	B
yeah and it you know i mean they they're just a convenience for me i don't have to get cash out of the bank and i don't have to to be writing checks and and uh	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
yeah uh-huh	3821	B
yeah i mean it it's easy i mean you- you know you don't have anything transferring just a little signature so what you know	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
right	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
surprising	3821	B
yeah well you know but the i mean there are sort some inherent limits there you're not going to you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that right	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
now i with- the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know not so much discipline i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly	3821	B
that i	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
i'm uh thirty three	3821	B
thirty two excuse me	3821	B
	3821	B
yeah	3821	B
	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
you know i just that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest and and my wife recently uh	3821	B
decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off and she's from there and and uh didn't really have the money but you know she could pay it off and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards but she's paying it and uh	3821	B
i just won't do it i mean she's paying i don't know i don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money i'll go to the bank and uh	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
oh yeah	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
right	3821	B
right	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
yeah	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
right	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
huh	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
well i might	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
um	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
right	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
hum i might try that because i i have one card that i've had for about uh	3821	B
i don't know nine or ten years	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
right	3821	B
<silence>	3821	B
yeah for me the big thing you know is the uh uh	3821	B
is the uh the annual fee and i just refuse i won't get any card now i've i've got a good rating and i've got you know and i'm not going i'm not going to pay an annual fee the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first	3821	B
	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
i don't know um let's see have you seen John F Kennedy	3858	B

<silence>	3858	B
it's supposed to be kind of scary well let's	3858	B
 no well i mean	3858	B
um let's see	3858	B
well actually i have seen one i'm trying to think of the name of it um	3858	B
it's got Bruce Willis in it and um	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
yeah but i can't think of who's in it but it was real good	3858	B

<silence>	3858	B
 i yeah well- you you know who i'm talking about i'm trying to	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
well i can't think of it but that was it was really i thought i liked it because_1 it was funny and they had so many it was i mean it was really action packed and it was bloody but they had a lot of um	3858	B
like one liners and stuff but i cannot think of the name i'm so bad with names of movies	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B

<silence>	3858	B
okay well um let's see	3858	B
well i want to go see that one but i'll probably wait for it- till it comes out on video because_1 i don't think i can get any my date to take me	3858	B
 well- that's why i'm	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B

<silence>	3858	B
 now it's too late now	3858	B
no well- um trying to think what else i've seen	3858	B
that's even- i guess if i see them_1 it's because they come on HBO or whatever	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
well see now Edward Scissorhands been on there like every week now	3858	B
i'm trying	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
and then well what about the one with Tom Cruise in it that's an old one Days of Thunder	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
really	3858	B
it- it- it's okay probably have to be a Tom Cruise fan	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
<silence>	3858	B
	3858	B
why don't you start because_1 i'm sure you've seen more movies than i have	3858	A

<silence>	3858	A
	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A

<silence>	3858	A
uh-huh	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
uh-huh	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
 well i had a little more time to think while they were trying to find somebody and you know i haven't seen i haven't seen um any current releases my husband and i just don't get out to the movies that much	3858	A
um no but we we're lazy we like to rent and watch them_1 and be able to rewind them and say what he say	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
we saw well we saw Flatliners i like that a lot	3858	A
yeah and um let's see Awakenings did you see that	3858	A
oh it was great it was real good it was kind of and it's a true story or so they say yeah about these people that that uh like	3858	A
near comatose i guess you'd say and they uh with medication they're able to wake them_1 up after- after like twenty thirty years and i mean it's not a real action packed movie but it was pretty neat	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
ooh and did you like that one you did okay and	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
you know i've been wanting to i every time i go to the movie store to rent that it's all rented	3858	A
yeah i mean i've been at least three or four times just to get that movie and every time i go i guess i must be going at the wrong times	3858	A
i did see Beauty and the Beast it's beautiful	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
yeah just go to a matinee there's so many kids there nobody will notice- notice that you're not you know with a kid i said there's there's so many people you won't notice you're not they won't notice you're not with anybody	3858	A

<silence>	3858	A
hm yeah i saw that one too did you like that one	3858	A

<silence>	3858	A
how many times did you see Dances with Wolves	3858	A

<silence>	3858	A
	3858	A
 yeah i wanna see that one too my husband kind of went hm	3858	A
so he wasn't real excited about going to see that one have may have to go with my mom	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
oh really yeah i'll probably wait for that one to came up on video it has to be real good for me to spend the money	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
which one	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
oh i haven't seen that one either	3858	A

oh no i haven't either my in in fact we're supposed to get out to movies tonight but i don't know what we're gonna go see	3858	A
 yeah well we might be going to a late one yeah	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
yeah see we've got HBO and you they have to be pretty old to get on there	3858	A
well i think so i think they have a lot of the same ones run over and over again	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
yeah that's what i hate is they overdo it when you know when they get a major release	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
	3858	A
yeah is it good	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
is it	3858	A
yeah well my dad is if you can believe that but i'm not a real Tom Cruise fan	3858	A
nah he's okay but i don't think i don't see uh what i guess all the young girls see in him	3858	A
<silence>	3858	A
	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
 well uh as a former uh professor in a university and having been through college uh	3840	B
and graduate school myself i guess my own um	3840	B
advice would be to first try to assess the needs of the	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
the kid um some kids do very well in large universities	3840	B
and other kids do very well in junior colleges and other kids do very well in residential college environments um	3840	B
and i think it really depends upon the individual the safest bet for most people who want uh	3840	B
uh a good quality experience is a private college where they're gonna get an opportunity to have more personal contact and uh	3840	B
where they're going to be forced by the circumstances to learn more than might be the case in a big university	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
no i went to a big university i went um i went to Pitt as an undergraduate and i looked at small colleges and frankly um	3840	B
 i think i had this sense that it would have been more difficult at small colleges and i think it would- would have been definitely i mean i	3840	B
i graduated Phi Beta Kappa summa cum laude and went on to do a PhD and i think that uh had i gone to a small college i might have learned a lot more but i don't think my grades would have been nearly as good	3840	B
i think you can get away with more in a big uh a big university uh what what kind of experience have you had in this regard	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
uh-huh	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
 that's big yeah	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
oh yeah	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
well that's all right go ahead	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
uh-huh	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
no kidding	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
um-hum	3840	B
right	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
yeah	3840	B
<silence>	3840	B
what i think is one of the problems with with a kid going to a large university generally and this happens at Stanford at Cal out here	3840	B
 i- i think that the the residential college experience is generally the best for most kids some kids are particularly- pardon me	3840	B
well i mean uh let me let me give you an example of a college that would fit that description	3840	B
um i would say that uh some of the best colleges in the country	3840	B
are small residential colleges like Swarthmore College like um Amherst Wesleyan Williams College	3840	B
um those are places that that in academia are generally regarded as the best places to get liberal arts educations	3840	B
 on the other hand you can go to a big university and do very well and some big universities i don't know whether Bringham Young is like this but some have a small college feel to them you don't get a lot of foreign TAs you- i mean in other words that the people who teach really know how to teach	3840	B
and i think that's what important for a lot of kids uh in my case	3840	B
 i went through uh between sixty eight and seventy two in college and it was just this big uh grade game for me	3840	B
and i learned some things and i just luckily stumbled in the right area	3840	B
um but i was years out of graduate school i had worked in industry before i ever came back and wanted to use my training as a scientist to um	3840	B
you know to get anything done and as matter of fact i'm i'm working on a book and a theory	3840	B
uh which has its foundations ultimately in theoretical physics and i'd never would have imagined myself wanting to do something like that i had such a negative-	3840	B
<silence>	3840	A
um Lee what advice do you have for someone choosing a college	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
uh-huh did you go to a private college for your undergraduate	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
uh-huh	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
well um	3840	A
 i went to a private university although it was a large private university it was Bringham Young University in Utah and that's uh has about twenty seven thousand students	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
so it's it's pretty big	3840	A
but	3840	A
 i enjoyed my experience there one thing i was thinking about this topic is um	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
i would try and get a lot of input from	3840	A
 from other students who had gone to the college in the particular program and see how they liked it for example i made well- i had a bad experience in graduate school	3840	A
and i think i would never have gone to the place had i have went and visited the place and talked to some of the students who were currently in the program for example i um started graduate school um	3840	A
in well i don't know if i should give specific names but uh it was	3840	A
um it was just in a physics program back east and um well it happened to be in Pittsburgh it was the University- it was Carnegie Melon University and	3840	A
the teaching assistantship situation just was not very good it turned out that um	3840	A
 there were six new teaching assistants from the US who went we all quit after our first year of graduate school um	3840	A
it turned out that the undergraduates had thrown a big fit the several years before that they weren't learning from the foreign TAs and they had six new students from- foreign TAs-	3840	A
TAs also but the foreign TAs could not teach the classes and so there was a huge teaching burden on us the US um	3840	A
TAs and so it's we were really bogged down and	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
you mean community college type or you mean by residential college do you mean	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
oh i see oh	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
oh yeah	3840	A
<silence>	3840	A
	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
i haven't done too much uh i mostly get stuck doing repairs like broken- replacing a broken window the neighbor threw a rock through the window with his lawn mower	3823	A
	3823	A
yeah yeah that's all there was to it	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
well the screen still has a hole in it so don't be too impressed	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
oh wow	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
yeah	3823	A
yeah what all did you do to your eighty year old home did you totally remodel it or had	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
oh yeah	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
i'll bet yeah	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
oh no	3823	A
right right	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
oh the	3823	A
oh yeah uh-huh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
that that's right yes i lived for a while in Ohio and i was so impressed with the old homes there that the big old homes but i know people were constantly remodeling them_1 and fixing them_1 up	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
that's right and those lovely old homes had no insulation whatsoever	3823	A
	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
i'll bet it was did it damage the walls	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
um-hum	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
	3823	A
	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
well you gave it your best shot	3823	A
yeah	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
	3823	A
and overdid it	3823	A
i'll bet that eighty year old house had a lot of pretty moldings	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
oh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
	3823	A
<silence>	3823	A
no i've just recently helped a friend put up crown molding in the in his guest bedroom	3823	A
up around the ceiling of- course it was a ten foot ceiling in there and it was a rather small room to-	3823	A
	3823	B
so have you remodeled your house recently	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
can you do that yourself or do you have it done	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
and then you put putty around the edges	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
i'm i'm impressed that you did that though	3823	B
	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
we um live in our current house about three years and we've only done minor repairs like painting and we did put a new roof on but previously we had owned a eighty year old house in another city	3823	B
and that's where i got my real experience at repairs and so i've replaced many windows	3823	B
but they had wooden they were wooden windows and um i don't know for some reason it the putty seemed easier or something because_1 it blended in	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
well uh we had a lot of it done i can't claim to have done much of it it had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so that they were all um even tiled- what do you- i forgot what you call that where you skim the top and then revarnish	3823	B
and we had it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done	3823	B
we bought when we bought the house uh most of the walls were covered in fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it once that the previous owners had their furniture out it looked pretty bad so when- then we took down the	3823	B
um fabric to find huge plaster cracks	3823	B
not unexpected i suppose but so we repaired a lot of that and then um we didn't do any real major we moved just a couple walls	3823	B
and we put in new bathroom fixture not- not- we kept the fixtures but we put in like a new we did put in a new bathtub and then we sort of bought the antique looking	3823	B
you know the brass plumbing type thing although it was new	3823	B
i like old houses but it is everyone talks about it it's true small bathrooms and small closets	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
uh-huh	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
and plumbing you have to know a lot about plumbing	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
that's right	3823	B
you know we had we ran into an interesting complication um our house it had fifty six windows	3823	B
so we decided in order- with an exorbitant heat bill we decided one way we would attack that we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the attic a a lot of it because we didn't have very much the problem and we never anticipated it was in the summertime	3823	B
the humidity it it would rise and in the stairwell at the top of the stairwell it literally would um the humidity would condense on the walls so that the walls would sort of sweat and	3823	B
when we had an engineer come out and talk he just said that we had over insulated our house so it quote couldn't breath	3823	B
and so the humidity when it would you know that the the highest point would go up there and then and then would condense and it was it was really a problem	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
 well not you could i don't know i'm sure over the long term it would and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the in the paint	3823	B
um we put in the first thing we tried we just put in a fan in that area so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help um	3823	B
we actually took a screen uh door window off one of windows to try and allow a little ventilation in that area and then the truth is it then became	3823	B
cooler weather and then we sold our house and i never i always hope that the owners didn't have the same problem next year it's all those things that you don't necessarily want to tell them i don't know i mean we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything you just	3823	B
we gave it our best shot but it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious and you know it's	3823	B
perhaps we overdid it	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
its prettiest features it had beautiful wood molding high ceilings and it had beautiful cut glass french doors	3823	B
and um i suppose that was it's it's prettiest features but- and the and the floors were beautiful	3823	B
but it much like the Swiss Avenue area in Dallas	3823	B
i don't i only have friends there	3823	B
i don't think i have the energy or the money for those sort of beautiful old homes now	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
that's	3823	B
<silence>	3823	B
	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
oh i do um cross stitch and some needle point	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
and needle- needle point and i also crochet	3863	B
yes	3863	B
uh what kind	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
	3863	B
what kind of hobbies do you have	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
oh yeah	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
what kind of music do you do do you do you perform or do you	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
wow	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
uh-huh	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
oh it sounds like you are busy that's almost an occupation now	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
for uh for ham radios	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
oh	3863	B
yeah i've always thought that was interesting i've never know anyone or or used a ham radio but i always thought that the concept was really interesting	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
um-hum i didn't know how far of a of a distance i guess depending on what kind of aerial that you use	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
yeah	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
wow	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
uh-huh	3863	B
regularly	3863	B
that's exciting	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
oh	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
uh well actually yeah i've i've done some original work not very much in cross stitch	3863	B
but i- i did do one for my husband's mother	3863	B
and unfortunately she passed away the day i finished the day after i finished it	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
and uh she never saw it she never knew anything about it	3863	B
it is and	3863	B
it's kind of spooky the	3863	B
the thing that i did i did the twenty third psalm the last verse	3863	B
and it was i presume you're familiar with that	3863	B
and uh	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
yeah it's it's in uh it's one picture and it is hanging on the wall and i entered it in the State Fair of Texas under original art work and i won fourth place with it	3863	B
but i do pictures all around i've done some pictures oh i've done polar bears and sayings and i've done um uh sunsets and quite a few wedding and baby announcements	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
most of them are already worked out i have worked up some but not many of them and the ones that i haven't worked out there's magazines everywhere	3863	B
and there's uh craft books and there's several designers that once you've you've been with a particular craft like this you get to know the designers and	3863	B
you end up having some favorites in the designers	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
well	3863	B
<silence>	3863	B
well i do	3863	B
	3863	B
yeah but i've got uh a little baby he's there he goes he's seventeen months and uh my cross stitch time has	3863	B
good	3863	A
so what common hobbies do you have Cathy and	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
cross-stitch and uh needle point uh-huh	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
and you do crocheting	3863	A
my goodness i ought to have my wife here talking to you i think	3863	A
well i don't whether we can call it a hobby or not and uh many years ago music was a hobby to me	3863	A
but as i have gotten older i found out that music has taken over about half of my time	3863	A
and uh now that i'm i retired about uh not quite a month ago that'll be uh i guess uh most of my efforts	3863	A
	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
well i i	3863	A
yes i play uh violin in um three different symphony orchestras local- a local one here in State College and then one in Altoona which is oh forty five miles away and	3863	A
and another one at the Lockhaven University which is about forty five fifty miles away	3863	A
and uh i formed what is called a State College Municipal Band oh about_1 ten fifteen years ago	3863	A
i play trumpet in that and conduct occasionally once in a while	3863	A
so i'm pretty busy in keeping that band going and trying to keep my violin playing up to uh an acceptable level of these other orchestras	3863	A
	3863	A
it does does take a lot of work and then when i have spare time i uh also am an amateur radio operator	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
but i don't	3863	A
um-hum i have so little opportunity i am hopefully the next year or so going to uh rebuild my station and uh get back on the air a little bit more consistently	3863	A
i do have the equipment but as the antennas blew down the last few years i just went off the air and that uh that was the end of that	3863	A
	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
it is it's it's a very interesting thing to talk to people all over the world it's what it amounts to	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
depends upon the frequency and how good of an antenna you have and how conditions are about every eleven or twelve years conditions change	3863	A
 so that uh you're signals get into different parts of the world	3863	A
man i have at one time or another talked almost not every country in the world but in all areas of the world	3863	A
i oh i have uh when i was really active i had well over a hundred different countries that i had talked to	3863	A
yeah um-hum fairly consistently yeah well tell me about this work that you do and uh do you display- display these sell them or uh how do uh	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
you know that sounds exactly like things that Pat does but-	3863	A
 hum	3863	A
that is a shame	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
yeah and this is something that you would make into one square and hang on the wall is the way you do it uh-huh	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
where do you get the information to that enables you to do these different pictures are they already worked out so that you know	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
yeah	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
hum	3863	A
well that is a very interesting thing it it is awfully nice to have something to do that that you enjoy so much you can put you soul into it so to speak	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
yeah i can hear him	3863	A
<silence>	3863	A
 tell me what's the last movie you saw	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
Hook	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
oh yeah there seems to be a lot out especially around Christmas but we were	3880	A
kind of busy and didn't really get out to see any of them_1	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
uh the last one i went to the theater to see was uh The Doctors	3880	A
and i thought that was real good	3880	A
but i rent movies all the time	3880	A
yeah the last- the one that that seems to be the way we do it any more i saw Dying Young over the weekend	3880	A
and last week	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
uh what's her name Julia Roberts	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
and uh it was just really good	3880	A
i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying	3880	A
but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah trying to	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
i have been putting off to go see that one but my wife wants to see it too	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
oh yeah i	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah i went uh i went to the theater to see that one and then i rented it i think when it came out too	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
sometimes you're right it doesn't uh	3880	A
but it beats watching what ever is on television	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
we had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the Godfather movies	3880	A
	3880	A
so we did that	3880	A
and	3880	A
it was uh you know like fourteen hours of Godfather stuff	3880	A
no it took us about three days but	3880	A
yeah well it was still lots i'm telling you when that that the last hour you know number three	3880	A
we felt like we were Italians we were eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop	3880	A
there's three	3880	A
yeah it's almost something around fourteen hours	3880	A
	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
uh but my- i think my favorite though are old movies black and white	3880	A
uh	3880	A
i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that	3880	A
it's just i don't know there's just something about them_1 i think it reminds me of my childhood	3880	A
not i just remember you know when i was little in the summer we got to stay up all night and that's what was on	3880	A
so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
i watched uh Doris Day Retrospective on uh CBS the other night just	3880	A
i thing about her and different movies she'd been in and i realized how much i missed the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies	3880	A
they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater	3880	A
and because they were like fantasy and and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere i'll want to watch it so	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah i am still here yes	3880	A
yeah i was just kind of	3880	A
i am in a rest area and i was just kind of looking somebody went by there i	3880	A
yeah uh to Tennessee it's my mother's eighty fifth birthday	3880	A
uh Kingsport	3880	A
you know where that is	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
oh yeah are they still there	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
<silence>	3880	A
yeah i remember back when they first open in the early seventies there i worked at Univac and uh just down the road and boy all the everybody just	3880	A
	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
the last movie i saw in a theater was Hook	3880	B
and uh it was very enjoyable um	3880	B
i'm trying to think there's a lot of movies i want to see	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
but it but what the last one you saw	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
hum	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah we do too	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
is that good that's with um i'm trying to think who's in that	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
oh okay okay	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
um we want to go see JFK	3880	B
i mean i've heard lots of reviews and stuff but i still want to see it just to	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
and uh	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah it is and Plano has grown so much that	3880	B
um you know the restaurants and stuff are all so crowded now you use to be able to get out to get a quick bit to eat and go see a movie and it's just not that way any more	3880	B
so we usually stay in on Friday nights and rent movies and i think probably the last rented movie i saw	3880	B
well no i take that back it wasn't rented i think it was just on HBO at my in-laws house or something but it was Hunt for Red October	3880	B
and i love that movie	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah oh that would've been a good one	3880	B
that would've been a good one to see	3880	B
yeah but renting them_1 just doesn't do them_1 justice sometimes	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah that's true i mean i think like uh Dances with Wolves just	3880	B
you know would be a good movie on television but it you know the scenery and everything was so beautiful on the screen	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
oh really	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
all of them did you	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
oh wow in one night	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
 okay i was going to say that's a long movie	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
how many are there	3880	B
three okay	3880	B
well that's not as bad as as uh Friday the 13th or Planet of the Apes or	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
really	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
um-hum um-hum	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
we went through a stage where we rented a lot of the um Alfred Hitchcock	3880	B
the you know the like North by Northwest and Rear Window and all those and those are really good i mean you know the old black and whites and	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah oh yeah	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
hum	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
um-hum	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
oh they're those are some movies	3880	B
and they come on uh every now and then	3880	B
are you still there	3880	B
okay it got real quiet i didn't know	3880	B
there was no static or anything i thought no	3880	B
i thought i'd lost you	3880	B
so you are headed up to Tennessee	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
where about	3880	B
oh okay that's right yeah um i work for TI and i've traveled up to Johnson City before and i	3880	B
um most of it was sold off to Simon's but there is still about five hundred employees that work that are TI	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
oh	3880	B
<silence>	3880	B
	3884	A
okay i work with uh a lot of students and uh in my uh occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think uh	3884	A
the advice that i give to would give to uh parents i've had four sons- five sons that have gone to college- uh to uh college	3884	A
i think uh one of the main things is that they they choose a local college that uh or university	3884	A
that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if they're in the local area they don't have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things	3884	A
and uh	3884	A
and	3884	A
 go ahead	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
uh-huh	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
yes it is	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
uh that that's uh kind of the the advice that i give and then uh they need to take a look at the uh courses- uh the courses of study and uh how it would go into their their major minor field uh	3884	A
what kind of placement uh they have in the particular area you know i had one son who uh went to a smaller college uh to uh went out in the uh premed area	3884	A
but they had an excellent record of placing uh their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was	3884	A
 right he got early acceptance to a to medical school after he finished and uh if he would've gone to uh say the state uh it would be the University of Utah	3884	A
if he would've gone there uh i don't know whether he'd got accepted to medical school there or not	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
yes uh	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
and you you can do this for any of the uh any uh university or or for any of the students that are planning uh take a look at uh their final goals at least hopefully they've got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then uh	3884	A
if it's law school or if it's uh medical or whatever	3884	A
there are different uh colleges and universities usually within the state that uh have a little- little better placement record or or getting them into into those higher degree or higher areas of education	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
i see uh-huh	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum you bet	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum and uh that would be school- a school that the parents uh should seek out for their uh students if they're interested in that that field and	3884	A
and where it's well known uh the word gets out and that that might be a a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the the uh to to go to to Penn State	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum yes	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum you bet	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
um-hum well that's very important in in a choice of a college or university that they look at those aspects uh wherever they might be	3884	A
and if it's uh financially if they can do that that's that's great	3884	A
but they- they need to know about the the costs and uh how they're going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh	3884	A
 uh the bottom line is uh the the college or university that's gonna give them the best training prepare them for life	3884	A
<silence>	3884	A
	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
yeah that's certainly helpful	3884	B
 say your last suggestion there about	3884	B
staying within state i realize that there are a lot of schools unless uh uh the student has a real specialty	3884	B
and there oh maybe are one or two universities that are highly respected in that field they really ought to try to stay within their state i mean	3884	B
financing in universities now is getting a very very high	3884	B
and they can't help themselves on that either so it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
yeah	3884	B
	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
that's very important	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
well that was certainly uh good advice to get him to go to a school who follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their students that	3884	B
that means that the quality of what he was taught must be very very high	3884	B
and that's good for him too regardless of where he works he has uh a top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
well we have that same situation here i'm i'm a retired professor at Penn State	3884	B
and uh the field i worked in was acoustics	3884	B
and we have an acoustics department here and we- have lots of students several hundred i guess in in acoustics and they have an excellent opportunity to	3884	B
follow through on their fields because our university is well known for it's research in addition to uh teaching obviously if we can do	3884	B
high class research we must be well trained and and uh available to teach the students well	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
yes	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
yes	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
yes because_1 Penn Penn State is very well known in uh many of its uh many- of its fields and	3884	B
uh we we get a lot we do we only we get our sort of say we get state uh students not only from out of state but from all over the world	3884	B
i mean they they they really come here we have a very high uh percentage of foreign students because Penn State is pretty well tops in many of its fields	3884	B
and we have doubled in size in the last fifteen twenty years i guess	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
yes that's true	3884	B
<silence>	3884	B
yes and then the basic thing is that you started out earlier to say the the bottom line is to give your	3884	B
	3828	A
so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
yeah that's	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
no i have to i have to agree with you i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the Richardson- Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak and you know it's a shame	3828	A
a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced	3828	A
something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in uh a year	3828	A
on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a stash- stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and uh when he uses- spends-	3828	A
uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
well we don't either in Texas	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this	3828	A
as far what goes on with our	3828	A
criminal system our judiciary-	3828	A
-judiciary system and everything else it's just uh it's terrible the way it is right now	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if it's uh crimes like we're just been discussing	3828	A
obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them_1 off the streets but i don't think that's gonna happen because just like you said and	3828	A
our state's a good example your state's a good example and it's just not gonna happen as far as the murderers	3828	A
and people that commit rape and things like that i'm not sure what's right but i know that it's- it's not right to put him in there and	3828	A
let- let him live for years and years and years before you do execute him or whatever because_1 it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to	3828	A
i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of TV and i'm sure they have uh	3828	A
exercise facilities and movies and and everything else you know they can	3828	A
have a good time in	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
no it really isn't	3828	A
it's a big it's a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it	3828	A
so i don't know	3828	A
i'm uh i'm pretty much of a hard person uh	3828	A
i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
oh	3828	A
you bet i mean that's the only way to	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them_1 and all you know it's just unbelievable	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
can you really	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
gosh	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
oh i know see	3828	A
meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
yes	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
the drug problems that's another one	3828	A
<silence>	3828	A
	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
well i'm	3828	B
think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people	3828	B
getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they're	3828	B
given by the court system but i don't know with the economy the way it is i think crime can't do much but go up	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
right	3828	B
	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
well there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina the average serves six weeks	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
well we- see we don't have any room in our prisons so	3828	B
they shuttle- they shuttle them_1 in and shuttle them_1 out and they get them_1 get them_1 early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then they're they're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals	3828	B
and it just it it's just really absurd	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions	3828	B
that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because_1 they realize there's absolutely- or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
uh yeah	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
yep	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
well i don't know what the answer is but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working so	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
i hope so i don't	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
oh i definitely believe in capital punishment	3828	B
it's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that i don't i'm kind of curious- curious about what-	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
yeah you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost- almost a period of twenty years	3828	B
yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the North Carolina Supreme Court	3828	B
and then uh after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States and that usually takes another four to six years so it's	3828	B
<silence>	3828	B
they're hoping i guess they're what they're hoping- they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did but it just uh	3828	B
we have a serious problem in we have so many problems in this state right now and and the the thing is the the fundamental-	3828	B
the fundamental problem is the legal- is	3828	B
	3893	B
well as about as a matter of fact about two years ago right now uh i've completely and totally remodeled and restored my kitchen	3893	B
yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the kitchen we've we had was um	3893	B
had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops	3893	B
at first i was- we were just gonna paint the thing and you know how everything just sort of grows	3893	B
and uh so i ended up just just tearing- tearing out the whole place and uh putting sheet rock in and building my own cabinets with ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything new floor	3893	B
well uh i'm fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
yeah um-hum	3893	B
i love that it's it's really pretty we had just uh Formica	3893	B
and when i built the new cabinets uh i looked into this tile deal and i thought well you know i think we can probably do this	3893	B
and um it was uh	3893	B
it was not even- not hard at all um it just i just followed the instructions the basic instructions that you use with the tile and uh they're not hard at all really it's just about anybody can do that	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
no not at all um uh what we what i've been doing is just using some like bleach and it uh gets it clean but it does it has browned over the the couple of years	3893	B
you know but it really don't look that bad even though it has gotten brown you know what i should have done now that i think about it was used brown colored grout	3893	B
and	3893	B
that's right that's right	3893	B
you know because it does stain some i mean you could whiten it but i never have	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
um about three months probably three or four months	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
yeah yeah	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
well it was for a while the worst part about it was we had to do it when i got to the sink part over here what i did was i left this cabinet	3893	B
just about this one wall where the sink is to the very last	3893	B
and um i figured well you know i'll remodel the rest of the kitchen and then when we get to that point i'll do that last because_1 we so we can keep the sink as long as possible	3893	B
and then we had we were without a sink about a week or a week and a half or so	3893	B
and um what we had to do was just take the dishes and uh put them_1 in a big dish pan	3893	B
and you get water from the bath tub and then rinse them_1 in you know for with the bath water- not not in the tub but you're just letting it run under there you know	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
real really yeah we did eat out a lot	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
not a thing not a thing i almost thought i had cut through a water pipe in the wall but i didn't i just nicked it a little bit it wasn't all the way through and now that was about it	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
yeah well have you have you done anything like that or or anything smaller or	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
um-hum	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
oh no no there's nothing like that here either	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
uh-huh	3893	B
oh yeah	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
yeah	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
sure	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
right right	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
oh sure yeah it does	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
that's right you are	3893	B
 and you're and you're half and half	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
yeah	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
oh	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
oh i understand yeah a little latch like yeah right	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
well yeah yeah everything is still so brand new yeah	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
um-hum	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
oh i see	3893	B
well yeah sure	3893	B
<silence>	3893	B
no yeah now something like that i would probably have hire- have to hire	3893	B
-okay so have you had a project recently	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
that's a project	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
yes	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
you must you must be pretty handy	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
so you did the tile counter tops how do you like that	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
did you have or do you have any problem with staining of the grout	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
and just start out with that and uh-huh	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
 well how long did it take you to complete this	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
that's not bad considering you did it yourself although i'm sure it was a real pain to have to live you know with everything	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
no i know what you mean sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your wife didn't cook for about three months	3893	A
 did you have any major catastrophes or anything	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
	3893	A
 well that's quite an undertaking uh you know	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
well nothing that big a deal my husband did um he made a cedar closet and shelving out in the garage uh for us which really was nice um	3893	A
i don't know how it is in Biloxi we Dallas has no basements i suspect Biloxi	3893	A
yeah well we come from the Midwest where there's basements and you know so you have to make storage where you can	3893	A
and uh he bought the sheeting uh the cedar sheeting and put that in and i didn't know for certain how that would you know how that would work out if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out but	3893	A
it's been great we haven't had any problems with moths or anything and the extra he finished the outside painted it to match the uh garage walls which is white and it's just beautiful it really added a whole lot you know {storagewise} to the house	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
but uh i think the only glitches he ran into on that i put a few nails in it so i consider myself a partner in this but	3893	A
yeah right the only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the doors he had to put in oh like some extra closure because even though he thought that the um the plywood that he got was straight	3893	A
somehow the humidity or something warped it a little bit while he was building it and we have to have a little closing you know to hold it down at the bottom	3893	A
 um-hum	3893	A
but that- that was about it but our house in only four years old so we haven't done you know just a whole lot to it at this point	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
um-hum although we're talking about adding uh the the ceilings here are high and the pitch of the uh roofs are very high and we're talking about adding like some rooms up in the attic space	3893	A
uh because there is so much space up there	3893	A
but uh i don't know that that's something we will undertake ourselves part of it we'll probably do you know like hanging the	3893	A
<silence>	3893	A
	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
well i think they ought to spend- uh i don't think they ought to spend overly spend on it but uh i don't see anything wrong with you know having a pretty good budget for it because uh	3816	B
heck i don't know i don't i think maybe one day they will uh find a good use for it you know maybe they haven't all that much yet uh other than the little things they've developed in this space shuttle	3816	B
the little experiments that they've done and so forth you know	3816	B
in uh i know they asked the question uh would you go if you had the chance and i'd go tomorrow	3816	B
if i had a chance	3816	B
yeah right	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
well i don't know i just it would be something i've never experienced before weightlessness i'd love to experience weightlessness that's something i've always uh thought would be fascinating you know	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
yeah	3816	B
yeah i think so	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
when they had the uh accident you know back- the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i won't go you know but uh since then i thought well what the heck i'd go if it would be a one time- once in lifetime experience i'd try it	3816	B
no i don't think so	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
uh it might it it very well may uh i think it's sort a	3816	B
had a setback because of that accident and uh and sometimes i get really disappointed because they have so many delays when they have a launch	3816	B
and everything i think gee you know they'll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch	3816	B
so i don't know you know they seems like they sort of bog down they're not really progressing right now to me	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
yeah	3816	B
yeah well i believe that uh they'll eventually make it to Mars you know maybe not in our lifetime but uh you know if this world is still here at that time i think they'll i think they'll eventually do that	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
right	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
is that right i didn't realize that	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
uh-huh	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
sure sure	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
yeah well that's true that's true and i guess they've got a lot of uh they've done a lot of medical tests	3816	B
uh in space too and uh i mean- i don't know what they've they've actually come up with	3816	B
but uh i know that medicine is another	3816	B
area that they used- that they've used in space a lot you know	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
that's right	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
right right	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
is that no i don't even know about that	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
oh yeah the the the ice	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
right	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
uh-huh	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
right- to the weightlessness yeah	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
i think- i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of	3816	B
sort of sitting still but i think eventually it will uh they'll it will come to them	3816	B
 you know	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
that's right well you know talking about the weightlessness i've uh i've uh noticed that they've talked about like these Russian astronauts that stay up there for nearly a year	3816	B
you know they have a lot of problems with the i'm not sure what it is with the the muscle muscle- tone and so forth because_1 they uh	3816	B
they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but it's not the same as exercising with gravity and the i i'm not sure exactly	3816	B
what the deal was but there were some problems with long term weightlessness	3816	B
yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess	3816	B
<silence>	3816	B
i- i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i- i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when- when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they walk- they couldn't walk very well	3816	B
when they finally made it back into gravity and uh i'm not sure exactly why that was you know i mean it was because of the weightlessness but i'm not sure physiologically what happened	3816	B
 ready so what do you think do we spend too much on the space program or	3816	A
do you	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah we could	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
oh you're an adventurer huh	3816	A
what makes it what makes it so exciting for you	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah that that'd be fun that'd be a lot of fun	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
that's true yeah i'd i'd have to i'd think once or twice but i think i'd probably do it just for the experience i guess but it'd be pretty interesting that's for sure	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
oh yeah you couldn't- couldn't pass it up that's for sure	3816	A
you think it'll ever happen where they'll let it'll be common or	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah that's true	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah i'm i'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station they're talking about you know i think that'd be a step to where you know in the right direction but	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah i'd uh just the way we progress i- i like i say i'd hate to see them_1 cut out the the budget there's a lot of places	3816	A
you know that can use it but just you know simple things like Teflon stuff like that all came from the Apollo mission yeah things they developed	3816	A
you know	3816	A
 in that program you know i mean- mean- mean just common everyday things that we take for granted but	3816	A
you know that's as an offshoot it's kind of like the military budget you know there's a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military	3816	A
that we end up using just a you know everyday stuff but something like that Teflon something you take for granted you use it every day but	3816	A
if it hadn't of been for something like that you'd never you know really you may not have got it so	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
well they said yeah	3816	A
uh-huh they say in you know in weightlessness they're they're able to do a lot of different things with the chemicals and minerals that they can't do with the gravity so	3816	A
there could be some valuable- i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i	3816	A
yeah i think it's	3816	A
they've been a little concerned because it's kind of chilly it's cold you know like you say so they're a little worried about the	3816	A
same thing that happened to the Challenger but they are going up to do some tests with some organisms- uh organisms and stuff and weightlessness to see how they uh	3816	A
how they react to that and everything but so i think i think you're right though they're getting little better and better sooner- sooner- you know sooner or later they're going to make some major breakthroughs	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah it's just a matter of time i guess nothing ever comes without- nothing ever comes without some effort so	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
oh really i hadn't heard that	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
huh	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
so it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they started or	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
	3816	A
<silence>	3816	A

<silence>	3807	A
oh it's been beautiful today yeah	3807	A
snow no not over here	3807	A
<silence>	3807	A
just a little bit north of us though yeah just a little bit north of- it's been beautiful today probably uh high fifties- fifties low fourties- maybe you know low sixties	3807	A
oh it's beautiful how about_1 there	3807	A
<silence>	3807	A
oh good good you've had enough uh water for a while	3807	A
	3807	A

	3807	A
okay	3807	A
<silence>	3807	A
what's that	3807	A
let's see i've got four kids and they uh our TVs are usually	3807	A
are usually yeah uh ruled by the kids so we watch all the usuals uh Cosby you know Cosby Kids and	3807	A
uh we yeah we like to watch comedy	3807	A
um uh we uh our kids are so involved in sports and stuff that our nights are not- we're not home	3807	A
very much at night so	3807	A
um what are yours	3807	A
<silence>	3807	A
oh is that right	3807	A
<silence>	3807	A
yeah- oh isn't that a great show that is the funniest show	3807	A
oh that is the funniest show	3807	A

	3852	B
okay	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
well Larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and and	3852	B
a couple of ladies ran a stop light the lights weren't working properly it wasn't their fault but we they didn't run it we both had green and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car so	3852	B
that was a huge repair bill	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
i know i hated that	3852	B
so it wasn't enough to total it but that's my that's been my most uh	3852	B
expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years and	3852	B
well i travel a lot so you know uh this last one i leased so i don't know and i leased it on a twenty four month program it's the first time i've ever done that but i'll probably go back to buying them_1 because i don't care to lease them_1	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
no it has the expanding balloons	3852	B
uh it they didn't go off	3852	B
no i guess we weren't going that sort of upset me we weren't going fast enough according- when i called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it but no sir didn't go off uh we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day and	3852	B
and the street lights	3852	B
yes	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
yes	3852	B
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything i tell you just	3852	B
took it all off it was uh uh my my doors were okay front and back and	3852	B
but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage it was a expensive- then i get it back and two weeks after that i'm driving it in front of the local high school	3852	B
and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage so	3852	B
so i'm gonna get rid- my twenty four months is up on this car i'm getting rid of this car	3852	B
	3852	B
my golly how about_1 you Larry	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
	3852	B
i understand	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
i understand	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
sure	3852	B
well- i understand that because i'm from West Virginia and we had the same thing up there continuously- continuously salting the roads for snow	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
sure	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
no i'm gonna i'm gonna buy it Larry i don't like the rental i think i'm getting ready to retire myself and i'm going to i'm going to be you know driving a car for longer so i usually drive a car	3852	B
for three years and and anyway and	3852	B
so but last couple cars i've only driven for two years so i'd leased this one for two years so i'll probably go back and buy one and uh this next car -will probably be my retirement car	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
well- no sir not really not really uh	3852	B
no problem at all my wife and daughter we have uh two Toyotas in the family one Nissan and we have the Lincoln and uh the not really no problem there at all as finding- as far as finding parking places it's it's convenient in that in that regard	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
yes it is and i'm and i travel i'm like a traveling salesman don't travel a lot any more but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
yes	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
is that right	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
-well my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old it only has doesn't even have thirty miles- thirty thousand miles on it so gosh been much in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car	3852	B
<silence>	3852	B
 okay_1 Ron welcome to the net and uh what did you do about your last auto repair oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
um	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
my goodness gracious that's	3852	A
well that's still not enough for a total is it	3852	A
to get it's a very expensive automobile	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
oh and do you buy one every two years	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had	3852	A
did that help you	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
they didn't go off	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
well what-	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
but you were hit in the side weren't you	3852	A
that may be the problem you you might- you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to uh activate it	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
my goodness	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
my goodness	3852	A
	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
i would think so that doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one	3852	A
well i'm relatively fortunate about that uh here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities	3852	A
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they don't have to drive that way here and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle	3852	A
and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time	3852	A
uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh and i drive a Honda most of the time	3852	A
and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
well i just i did- i had this Cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders	3852	A
uh done and then it all repainted and then winter got here and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off so i haven't had a chance to drive it very much	3852	A
but anyhow uh uh now are you gonna buy this next car or you going rent it a lease again	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
are you	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
well that's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the Lincoln uh isn't it too large for normal town driving	3852	A
finding parking places and getting in and out the doors	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
ah	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
yeah	3852	A
well- well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips	3852	A
i'm i'm very much aware of that	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
yes i'm sure it is because that's the way that i enjoy this Pontiac that i have it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine	3852	A
<silence>	3852	A
um-hum do you do you feel that uh	3852	A
<silence>	3838	B
well if you're from Iowa you must be very artsy-craftsy everyone i've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
i didn't know anyone ever moved from California to Kansas- Iowa	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
i'm teasing only because i'm from Indiana i really liked i like the Midwest	3838	B
but i married a Texan and they have a way of dragging you back home	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
anyway we're supposed to be talking about crafts do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands like knitting or	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
oh you do a lot then do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
um actually i i'm pretty untalented i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um	3838	B
but i- i don't know somehow i- i don't have the time anymore	3838	B
but i have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their um bags some their most recent uh needle craft	3838	B
and in December everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
yes	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
is this your first baby have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself or	3838	B
how- how did you make a quilt	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
uh-huh	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
but you actually hand quilted it yourself	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
did did you need a loom or were you able- was it small enough that you could just hold it	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
uh-huh	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
but um	3838	B
my again my mother back in Indiana we had a quilting frame in our basement and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself	3838	B
um yes which i was always amazed i have one of them_1 um but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
have you think children you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children	3838	B
i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and	3838	B
are are wonderful and and they'll wear them_1 once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear your	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
oh yes i think it's very clever it's uh funny that you said that for Christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful Christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely	3838	B
but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it so i had- i went and bought just some	3838	B
cloth glue and glued it all back and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable and i	3838	B
but it's so i'm familiar with that but i think you're very clever to um sew around the edges i think gluing alone	3838	B
certainly would if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges	3838	B
<silence>	3838	B
	3838	A
okay_1	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh well actually i'm from California and before then i was from Utah so	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
well i grew up in California and then i went to school in Utah and i got married there and we stayed there for a while and then now we're in Utah- Iowa	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
	3838	A
oh	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
um	3838	A
well i crochet and i do water color and i um sew and i do fabric painting	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
um i've done some cross stitching	3838	A
i haven't tried any needlepoint yet how about_1 you	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh right	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
uh-huh	3838	A
oh God	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh yeah well those take a lot of time i only can do things that are pretty fast because	3838	A
we just um got our baby last year and i just	3838	A
don't have the patience to just- you know be some uh-huh	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
um	3838	A
	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
um	3838	A
	3838	A
um our baby's quilt it was a pre	3838	A
like the design i just went around the design in the quilt i didn't piece it or anything like that	3838	A
but uh	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
uh-huh and just-	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
um	3838	A
i put it on the frame the quilting frame	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
have you are you familiar with that yeah okay	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh my God	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
well i haven't done tons of them_1	3838	A
but um i used to do more before um	3838	A
before i had before we got our baby but	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
uh-huh	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
yeah exactly	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
 well one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just	3838	A
make a T-shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make	3838	A
um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with	3838	A
Heat and Bond or whatever and then paint around it and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first	3838	A
and then i paint around it so you can't see the stitching as much	3838	A
does- does that make sense to you	3838	A
so	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh sure uh-huh	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
oh	3838	A
<silence>	3838	A
well	3838	A
yeah someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways and i've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even	3838	A
even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps	3838	A
and um	3838	A
	3802	A
Mike i'm calling from Dallas from Richardson	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
okay well good	3802	A
you know our subject is on boating and sailing	3802	A
and quite honestly with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
oh do you well great	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
well that's neat	3802	A
	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
right	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
i've seen some nice nice sailboats the guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it	3802	A
right in the uh driveway and it seemed i think it held probably uh it must have slept four people anyway	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
right	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
 i i understand	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
i'll tell you it's	3802	A
oh they are and you know we have a swimming pool at our house and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because_1 i know it's a lot of maintenance	3802	A
oh gosh yeah	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
sure	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
you bet i know my wife and i were first married her aunt and uncle uncle- aunt and uncle up in New York they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay	3802	A
and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older	3802	A
Chris Craft and we were involved every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that we just worked all the time but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen	3802	A
it was sort of neat we but i think that was the last time we were really involved in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago it is a lot of fun	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter	3802	A
and he had a place on the Lake of the Ozarks and he had a boat and uh	3802	A
i never seen so many boats in all my life people actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying and- townhouse or condominium whatever they own and they they go boats i mean they go if they wanna go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
and that was sort of neat yeah that's- that's that's true that's exactly how they do it they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants that was sort of a neat setup i enjoyed that we spent a week with them i enjoyed that	3802	A
but i'm envious i'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
think- you think you'd really enjoy it	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
yes	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A

<silence>	3802	A
	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
and putt putt sure well that's neat where do you work who are you with	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
well good	3802	A
<silence>	3802	A
	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
oh okay great i'm in Addison here	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
right	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
i do uh quite a bit of sailing i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but	3802	B
 i haven't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately since it's i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore so it's hard for me to get it somewhere but	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
yeah this one is not that big it's a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of	3802	B
stuck your body out the whole it back into the main part of the sailboat but	3802	B
but it's there they can be black holes to throw money into	3802	B
boats are kind of expensive to maintain	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
especially a bigger one the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat	3802	B
power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it the sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up but you still have to	3802	B
worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it it takes a a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
well it's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation	3802	B
uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it and- but it's uh	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
use the boat for transportation	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
they just go across the boat and get a and- tie it up and go in huh	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
yeah that would be fun	3802	B
<silence>	3802	B
 i've just never i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but	3802	B
um once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and uh i- i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh	3802	B
i might do something differently i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them_1 keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh	3802	B
yeah i think i would uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because it's so quiet	3802	B
and if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also	3802	B
where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun	3802	B
or if or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the middle of the lake i've with my little one i've been out there many times on a calm summer day	3802	B
where all of a sudden the wind stops and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and	3802	B
and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that and if you have- if you're have- big enough boat to have the little	3802	B
auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in	3802	B
 but it's fun i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh	3802	B
i'm a scout leader though so i'm i'm out with-	3802	B
	3833	B
uh do you work outside the home	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
oh poor baby	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
um-hum	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
oh yeah	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
um-hum	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
i work for a bank and uh i have to dress somewhat more formally	3833	B
so i- i look like the little old lady preppie	3833	B
	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh no i- i guess i could but i don't	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
no no we don't wear pants uh i- i wear suits	3833	B
uh almost exclusively	3833	B
have you ever had a uh a color analysis	3833	B
uh	3833	B
well it's a very interesting process	3833	B
uh according to the lady that did mine she called them_1 summer and winter	3833	B
and uh spring and fall and the summer she said you could call them A B C D or one two three four or whatever	3833	B
but there are people that look better in the cool colors	3833	B
than than the other people look better in the earth and warm colors	3833	B
and uh most people are summers or winters	3833	B
and uh	3833	B
uh it's really an interesting process and i found out i was a summer so i look much better in the the blues pinks	3833	B
uh	3833	B
the the winters uh wear stronger colors	3833	B
but basically the same types of colors but as a summer i'm not supposed to wear uh black or stark white	3833	B
uh	3833	B
the winters- just winters wear black and white and the summer uh the spring and and fall colors wear well i have a daughter in law that uh	3833	B
uh this the the camouflage colors the khakis and the olive drab green	3833	B
just make her eyes light up like crazy yeah and then i- i also have a daughter in law who has auburn hair	3833	B
so she wears the earth colors uh the oranges and the olive drab greens and the khakis and and uh they're most becoming to her so it it it it really is an interesting	3833	B
analysis	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
yeah uh-huh	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
	3833	B
yeah well reds uh i i have to have a red that leans towards the the blue uh in other words it leans toward the maroon	3833	B
but the reds that lead lean toward the orange don't do a thing for me	3833	B
so i have to be careful about reds	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
oh yeah oh yeah uh we have thirty nine- an average of thirty nine days when it gets down below freezing and as a general rule at least oh	3833	B
oh two or three days at a time during the winter we'll either have uh ice covered streets or two or three inches of snow	3833	B
so uh i- i wear woolens quite a bit	3833	B
	3833	B
oh yeah oh yeah it gets very warm in the summertime	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
yeah yeah uh-huh	3833	B
are are you over toward Fresno	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
uh south	3833	B
oh north oh i see i have not been i have not been north of of uh	3833	B
uh what is it uh Interstate Eighty that goes from Sacramento to San Francisco	3833	B
i have not been north of that highway	3833	B
<silence>	3833	B
yes uh-huh	3833	B
 so	3833	A
um i did until my company went bankrupt	3833	A
yeah now right now i haven't been able to locate a job down here in Patterson	3833	A
it's kind of a small	3833	A
city so	3833	A
i've been going to Modesto which is larger but it's not like being in the Bay area where i came from	3833	A
you know	3833	A
but anyhow when i did work in the winter time i wore uh my wool skirts and sweaters and boots	3833	A
because the Bay area gets kind of chilly in the winter time	3833	A
and um then in the summer time i just wore you know the polyester blouses and usually- usually pants and just uh heels you know	3833	A
so uh where do you work at	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
oh okay	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
right	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
you do you i don't suppose you can wear pants	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
oh because i never see anybody in the banks out here it seems like i never see them_1 with pants on	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
no no i haven't	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
oh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
oh really	3833	A
isn't that	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
hum	3833	A
yeah that would be interesting to do um i worked for a trucking company so we didn't really even have to dress up at all if we didn't want to we could wear pants all the time you know	3833	A
but uh i just in the winter time i just like to wear boots and you know the wool skirts and the sweaters and everything	3833	A
but uh i've never gone to and had a you know	3833	A
anything like that done to tell me exactly what color i would look best in	3833	A
uh i know i don't look good in yellow but i like pink and blue you know and red	3833	A
but uh i just look in the mirror and	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
um-hum um-hum	3833	A
uh-huh huh very interesting	3833	A
so do you have your do you like like do you in Dallas do you wear wool in the winter time or	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
um	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
um-hum and naturally it gets real hot in the summertime i suppose yeah	3833	A
yeah yeah it gets hot here in Patterson in the summer time more so than it did in the Bay area you know um like here	3833	A
uh like um a hundred and twenty six miles from Fresno	3833	A
but in the valley north	3833	A
right	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
right uh-huh	3833	A
<silence>	3833	A
oh i see uh-huh so you have came to California though do you have family-	3833	A
okay	2247	B
um	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
now the term personal computer uh i don't happen to have one at home	2247	B
um	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
but i do have a personal computer on my desk here	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yeah uh yeah just kind of it's kind of a kluge	2247	B
that was pieced together to to uh	2247	B
shall we say bypass the formal	2247	B
procurement process	2247	B
and uh it it works just fine it says it's a monochrome monitor	2247	B
Panasonic printer	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh	2247	B
no big deal it it does the things i need for it to do	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
no it's not even that	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh i think that's about where it is	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh yeah i do that i i do uh some Lotus on it uh do some uh Samna some uh PFM	2247	B
uh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
nothing extremely complex	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh-huh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yep	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
oh yeah i bet that's a pretty nice setup	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yep	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
wow	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yep	2247	B
wow	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh-huh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh-huh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
sure	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh-huh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yeah	2247	B
yeah	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
right	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in Samna i was still in PFM and	2247	B
now that i finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect so i can never quite stay current with that	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh-huh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
oh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
huh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
i can believe- i can believe that	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
no not really i'm not that up on that sort of thing	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
oh okay	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
oh okay	2247	B
okay	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
oh well it sounds like you're pretty much into computers	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
i can believe that	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
well it's it's been interesting	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yeah of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
oh it is is that the newest thing now the four eighty six	2247	B
that that must be a fairly recent release	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
okay okay because i i had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes but	2247	B
i didn't know they had a four eighty six just yet	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
uh-huh	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yeah	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
sure	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
yeah	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
i did too and you have a good day	2247	B
bye-bye	2247	B
<silence>	2247	B
<silence>	2247	A
a type of work station	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
it's eighty eighty eight	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
okay uh	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
okay uh i use them both here at work and at home	2247	A
and i have IBM clones in both cases	2247	A
here at work i have the TI one thousand which is a three eighty six base machine- machine	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it	2247	A
uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size	2247	A
and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it's knees because	2247	A
i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine and it brought it to it's knees	2247	A
just in the ability to handle	2247	A
and then i have uh	2247	A
a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine	2247	A
at home and i'm really pleased with it	2247	A
it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches	2247	A
uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them	2247	A
have you	2247	A
to try to make them more effective and useful	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
have you been uh struggling along those lines	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it it's uh	2247	A
i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it	2247	A
the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that	2247	A
of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
not a fun thing to try to recover from	2247	A
very frustrating	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
uh but again i've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise	2247	A
uh that was a	2247	A
engineering spec on B2	2247	A
you come here with the B level of specs	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
uh	2247	A
to one level down from assistant description	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
well i sure need them	2247	A
uh there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things	2247	A
i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have	2247	A
when you start seeing what all they can do for you	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
	2247	A
uh if needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty six machine at home	2247	A
	2247	A
right	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
uh that's came out around the first of the year	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
it does a few more things uh	2247	A
than	2247	A
had been available before	2247	A
but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation	2247	A
because you no longer can think that fast anyway	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
well okay i enjoyed our discussion	2247	A
<silence>	2247	A
you do the same	2247	A
bye	2247	A
	2247	A
	2246	B
	2246	B
well i'm more- more interested in the long-term effects than the short-term effects in terms of uh balancing budget and so forth um	2246	B
i tend to view um and i- i take a fairly radical view towards economic policy and feel that	2246	B
well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at uh on in some uh instances i think that um goods should cost um real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs	2246	B
and that means uh if you oh produce something that creates uh uh adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you uh the cost of	2246	B
forestry that you cut down and such needs to be uh reflected	2246	B
in	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're going is	2246	B
a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are	2246	B
brought about by various factors such as such as pollution stress you know work work environment conditions and so forth but generally the government is	2246	B
government or individuals end up paying for that rather than the uh some of the source of need for the health care	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um but that's a very long-term sort of concern	2246	B
um i don't i don't have great short-term effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes and no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and uh	2246	B
no one likes the idea of reducing spending very much so i don't see any real uh real immediate hope i mean it's the whole quota's living on debt i mean but and they buy things on credits constantly	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah well exactly	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yes well i i don't know anyone who paid cash for a house that's for sure yeah you don't have much um i	2246	B
 i mean it seems to me one might have choices if one radically restructured the system but that's not really a possibility at this point it has it's own inertia and	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
 yeah i hope so	2246	B
yeah well i'm i'm in academics and actually i'm in the job market now trying to get a professorship and i'm watching uh the education budget getting cut	2246	B
back so severely um at least in California where i am where there's a very severe budget crisis because_1 of agriculture was wiped out last year and um a number of other things and uh	2246	B
because_1 i'm i- i have a lot of i have some personal investments in this uh in addition to whatever philosophical investment	2246	B
there is and i don't know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a uh a major loaning nation to a major debt nation	2246	B
in the in the course of a decade um we are a lot has changed more radically	2246	B
and	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah it was it's it's uh seems to have worsened considerably	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum um-hum yeah well uh i can see you know it's it's it's	2246	B
it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to	2246	B
um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back it's a lot us that you know we don't really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and it's the-	2246	B
and it's the governments it's the governments should- that that's really what we do you don't go up to the country you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group and you loan it to these people who are representing the government	2246	B
and by extension representing the country but when those people are gone and you have some new	2246	B
you know starving third world country with a brand new government that threw the previous rascals out um	2246	B
they're personal incentive for repaying that debt is understandably low because_1 it's they didn't they didn't borrow- i mean you know it would be like you paying off the debts of uh some neighbors of yours you wouldn't feel very happy about it	2246	B
um	2246	B
so it's a sort of like this is uh i see a	2246	B
i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah i- i- i tend to get a little upset about loans to countries- to obviously corrupt governments um	2246	B
there a number of them for political reasons because we're enemies of the neighboring government or something like that so we give them an either corrupt government anyway but it's hard to view that so much as a loan as a bribe at that point	2246	B
um	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
you could afford to pay more taxes	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
um-hum um-hum well boy uh i mean i completely agree with you um on	2246	B
the stress that the tax burden for the upper class has actually decreased over the last ten years um	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah it's it's-	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
well the US pays the US pays less taxes than almost every industrialized country um	2246	B
	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah they	2246	B
they get things that they pay for	2246	B
um-hum um-hum	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah i- i think that's um well i think that's an important thing personally um	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
well they	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah i think the the Americans that i know who are are are sort of {antitax} a lot of them seem {antitax} because they're distrustful of the government will spend their money wisely	2246	B
and the sense is i can spend the money on myself if i gave it to the government they would just waste it	2246	B
seems to be an an an attitude i hear is a lot of people and i think you hear that attitude- you if you go to Sweden you won't hear that as much people will say well we need those services and we're it makes our country great so we will are more willing to pay for it uh	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum um-hum	2246	B
yeah	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
um-hum	2246	B
<silence>	2246	B
yeah well it uh it may not last once they i hope it does but it's uh it's uh sad situation part of this this you you hear the phrase creeping socialism	2246	B
which is uh uh a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and um	2246	B
you usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread lines in Moscow um but if you use i mean this creeping	2246	B
	2246	A
so Eric what do you think um	2246	A
that	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
so you think that they that those products should cost more	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
um-hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
um-hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
wow um-hum well do they i mean um i never liked doing that and i- i didn't up until uh several years ago when it came down to the point of	2246	A
you- you don't have a choice you know if you if you need to have a car then you have no choice and uh	2246	A
and uh it- it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things like buy a house	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
really i mean so what choice do you have then	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah i did it's just that uh	2246	A
there needs to be some some change take place so that the inertia can begin to go in a different direction and strike down	2246	A
you know that's the problem that i think we have	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
um-hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
um-hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
um-hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
well we were we were in debt before that it just wasn't as apparent	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
somehow we still	2246	A
i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually going to pay us back	2246	A
and that hasn't happened	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
um-hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
oh that's true i hadn't thought of it that way i think	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah that's true	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah that's true	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually going to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases	2246	A
uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's	2246	A
supposed to get to and in other cases it it does not	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal	2246	A
but	2246	A
i can't really understand why	2246	A
um it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes	2246	A
um a very low amount of money the same percentage may affect them thirty five or forty times more severely than the same percentage	2246	A
of someone's well -if if they earn a great deal of money and i would being somewhere in the middle feel like that it would be a lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted	2246	A
toward the top end if i- i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money	2246	A
i could afford to pay more taxes it wouldn't bother me a bit	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah they used to have and what do they i don't know what the percentage is now they used to be taxed thirty percent	2246	A
and i remember hearing an interview with uh who was it the man who invented Hawaiian Tropic	2246	A
you know and he he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
you know	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
well that's	2246	A
they they get well- it it depends on how you look at that because like Sweden they pay a lot in taxes but their day care is government subsidized	2246	A
women who want to stay home with their children are subsidized to do that they don't have to live um	2246	A
hand to mouth because it the government there and the country there has placed a very significant value on motherhood	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
um-hum i think we could learn some things from and the and the health care system you may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of and you don't have the corruption and in uh	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
medicine that that we have here with the the outrageous charges and	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah i think that if we could model	2246	A
you know programs after those that are already i mean they did a lot of work finding a program that worked and if we were to do the research take under advisement what they have	2246	A
already working and adapt it	2246	A
that- that that particular day care system um works very well and the Canadian health plan is probably the best one in existence today	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
hum	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
yeah	2246	A
<silence>	2246	A
uh tell you what um i'll let you start or if that's all right	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you um	2265	B
normally don't have time in the morning to to watch the any type of TV usually catch it going to work on the radio	2265	B
or when i drag the paper in from the front and it pops out of the bag i usually catch the headlines which is normally what you see the night before on the evening news yeah so uh i've kind of um	2265	B
uh we have a one year old in the house so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch TV during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or um	2265	B
um those type of issues i'd have to say during the war uh there were we were the American public was probably flooded with um	2265	B
uh too much information and as far as the sub question about was i satisfied- am i satisfied with the coverage i'd have to say	2265	B
yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who's telling the truth you could- between the channels there was	2265	B
uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over-communicated	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
true i agree with you	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
yeah which is a is a joke	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
um-hum	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
yeah that's a good point uh but i would have to say across the board i'm i'm satisfied with the way uh	2265	B
the news is is spread um of course here at Texas Instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant the secretary's probably are the best resource of what the layoff status is	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
yes	2265	B
yeah	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i i'm glad you mentioned that because_1 i think i have to since i don't have the opportunity in the morning i'll probably catch the the head lines uh on T News that's a good point	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
um-hum	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
 yeah true kind of short	2265	B
yeah least	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
um-hum	2265	B
well that's great	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
yeah i do surely do	2265	B
uh anything anything else cross your mind uh i guess most of us go by the audio which is the the television- television or the radio	2265	B
um	2265	B
yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read you know	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
hm	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
hm	2265	B
<silence>	2265	B
ouch everybody got excited	2265	B
that's tough that's tough well i've enjoyed speaking with you	2265	B
did you get your catalog on your- your your gifts	2265	B
oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling	2265	B
yeah they're not to shabby they're pretty good	2265	B
yes sir	2265	B
have a great day bye-bye	2265	B
	2265	B
<silence>	2265	A
okay um	2265	A
my major source of information i guess is TV news excuse me	2265	A
i uh wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work	2265	A
oh i	2265	A
quite frequently uh glance through headlines or in the newspaper	2265	A
but uh primarily mine is uh TV news	2265	A
how about_1 yourself	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
um true	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
uh-huh	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
well that's true but uh i	2265	A
 uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news medias were uh	2265	A
trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military	2265	A
now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in Vietnam	2265	A
uh but	2265	A
i mean let's face it today's- today's uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give away- away a	2265	A
piece of top secret information	2265	A
and uh	2265	A
pat himself on the back for for uh	2265	A
making a big scoop	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
 very true i find T News very enlightening and i check that everyday and of course with that goes along the the stock price of TI	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
of course T News is- is more or less headlines uh i don't think much of of their sports coverage	2265	A
all they give the scores	2265	A
but uh that's right i'm not	2265	A
yeah outside of of uh pro football i'm not too interested in other games- uh other sports anyway	2265	A
but uh the the T News is is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
uh-huh	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
well i spent twenty years in professional- in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh TV	2265	A
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and- of bits and pieces of news on the air	2265	A
uh i mean there there are times where uh video- uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb i've seen it happen time and time again	2265	A
and uh well i remember one time up in Nashville Tennessee was one of the fellows- fellows got mixed up in a with a riot going on down there but he was lucky he got out of it	2265	A
for some reason because he was carrying a camera	2265	A
uh they left him alone	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
um-hum	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
nice talking to you too Jim	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
no	2265	A
<silence>	2265	A
oh well i'll have to be looking for it then	2265	A
is that right well good	2265	A
you too	2265	A
<silence>	2288	A
okay	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
no it's really hard to do that i mean it's i don't know i guess um we do kind of have a budget um but it's kind of funny what we	2288	A
what we do i guess is we try to proportion uh who pays what according to the salary that we make	2288	A
uh do you not understand what i'm saying we we pay a percentage	2288	A
um which is kind of strange a lot of people don't do that but hey we find that it works you know	2288	A
well okay um like i pay a certain percentage of my pay check to the bills and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck do you understand okay i guess i didn't really explain that too well	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
oh that one gets used up quick is that it	2288	A
	2288	A
that's	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
oh wow that's really that is pretty detailed	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
	2288	A
well but you know that's good too because i've been in the situation in the past where i didn't know where my money was going and that	2288	A
that's hard to you know you can't keep up with it and it really gets you in trouble you know and	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
oh yeah	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yeah	2288	A
that's easy to do it's very easy to do and it's i don't it do you find it easier to i mean do	2288	A
with a budget do you feel like you're you do i mean i know you said you have better control but	2288	A
do you feel like you're really saving anything i mean	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
oh well that's	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
um-hum	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yeah	2288	A
which is easy to do	2288	A
	2288	A
yeah	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
right well that's good i know what you mean about the school because_1 that's what i'm trying to do also and we're trying to build it enough so that i can go to school full time because_1 right now i'm going to school part time	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yeah so you know trying to budget is again you know at- at this point we're trying to budget enough so we can	2288	A
save more um you know so i can go to school full time	2288	A
you know it's it's not easy to do but	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough it'll happen because because i can we can see it you know i think it's going to be a couple of years before i can do that	2288	A
but	2288	A
you know but at least i can see a little bit of the light just from you know doing this you know budgeting and stuff it really helps	2288	A
but	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
right	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yeah it really makes a world of difference doesn't it	2288	A
it really does i know i've been in like i said the same situation you know where i've	2288	A
i've been in a situation where i didn't budget anything just spent money and spent money and spent money and it doesn't work it doesn't it really doesn't uh makes a big difference	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yes	2288	A
oh definitely	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yeah	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
right	2288	A
yeah well that's that's a big that's really important because i do have a college fund set aside for my kids	2288	A
you know and my oldest one is um almost- going on nine so you know it's not that many years you know before she's going to be going so i hope that you know i can continue the college fund because it's	2288	A
	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
	2288	A
right	2288	A
no that's true i mean	2288	A
you hope you hope that they can but you know you can't plan right yeah that's right right that's that's the way you have to do it right no	2288	A
no that's that's an important thing to me and that's why it was very important for me because i didn't go to college out of high school it was important for me to budget in	2288	A
a um	2288	A
college fund for them because it was just so important i said i don't want them to go through what i went through	2288	A
they have to have a college fund so	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
right	2288	A
	2288	A
exactly	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yeah	2288	A
	2288	A
right	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
yes i know exactly i was the same way	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
very good yeah	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
uh-huh you're	2288	A
<silence>	2288	A
that's that's that's strange because ours	2288	A
all of their money goes in savings if they need something we buy it for them_1	2288	A
and all their money has to go in their savings account	2288	A
you know which maybe i'm being a little bit too harsh but but if they need something i buy it for them_1	2288	A
you know i mean if it's an absolute need	2288	A
you know if i mean if they want something occasionally but most of the time if it's a need i just get it	2288	A
<silence>	2288	B
well budgeting is a sore subject in this family	2288	B
 we've actually uh uh tried uh budgeting is very important to us we we try it every month and um i think it's good i mean it it gives us a sense of uh	2288	B
uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we we never seem to be able to stick with it	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
no	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
now i'm sorry what is what is this again	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
oh okay oh i see	2288	B
oh sure	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah okay yeah yeah that makes perfect sense	2288	B
	2288	B
yeah well yeah uh we ours is actually very detailed um	2288	B
we we've got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month	2288	B
and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately there's a big category called miscellaneous	2288	B
and uh miscellaneous-	2288	B
that's the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we	2288	B
figure it's going to be it's never what it was last month and uh and uh you know it's it's the one that's always the killer	2288	B
um but i uh you know it's uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we	2288	B
you know write our checks we even categorize our payments and i mean we even get into that kind of detail um so- so-	2288	B
so we i mean we do uh when you know whenever we	2288	B
go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category we're paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our money's going we don't have any control over it	2288	B
but we have a real good sense of where it's going	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
well	2288	B
we're we're at a point where we're trying to accomplish a lot of things right now and uh like	2288	B
my wife's going back to school and i'm going to school	2288	B
and we're our kid we've got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things	2288	B
and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something um	2288	B
and and what we've proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month	2288	B
is that we're spending more than than we make so it's it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
right	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
um	2288	B
well no i- i- i think um i- i- i don't think we're saving anything i- i think what we're doing is we're we're we're making it possible to	2288	B
to well and the fact what it is is it's making it possible to live beyond our means um because	2288	B
you know what- if we didn't track it we'd we'd totally blow it i think is what it would end up um um	2288	B
so you know we we do know that we can tell when we're getting to the point where we've just got to	2288	B
uh hold back on something uh we can we can see a cash flow that says	2288	B
this you know we can't do this right now because the money's just not there we we we're going to have to put it off for a week or a month or whatever the case so so yeah it you know it's um	2288	B
we uh you know we're not going to get this budget isn't going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty uh but	2288	B
yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too	2288	B
you know i'm going back to school my wife's going back to school too our lifestyle right now	2288	B
is meant to position ourselves so financial- uh the these financial problems won't be problems uh in the future and uh so	2288	B
we've that's that's the we're look we look it as as yeah we're living like this now but it's a short term investment for for a better lifestyle later on	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
right	2288	B
we're going we're going through the exact same thing	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
sure	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
and	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
no	2288	B
i- i don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point but uh	2288	B
um	2288	B
but it's something to work for	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
sure	2288	B
that's i think we're in probably in the same position	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
right	2288	B
right yeah	2288	B
yeah um and and and it also makes it possible	2288	B
you i think before we did any kind of budgeting	2288	B
we- we we were in we were in a constant state of saying we can't afford anything	2288	B
you know we can't do anything we can't afford anything and now	2288	B
we can at least say well we can fit this in	2288	B
it's it doesn't really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldn't before	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
right	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
that's right that's right it it it	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah i we i think that uh	2288	B
part of the uh the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that	2288	B
that there were those years where we lived that way	2288	B
and we're still paying for it	2288	B
	2288	B
from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting	2288	B
um	2288	B
yeah you don't want to	2288	B
especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up	2288	B
and they're they want to do things like go to college uh you don't want to say well we're still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
that's right that's right	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
i know	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
 right well you know i we're we're we're trying to put money away for that too and uh um	2288	B
um you know you just can't count on them being totally brilliant	2288	B
though though they are but you can't count on them being totally brilliant uh so that they can get scholarships and and things like that um it's you know	2288	B
it doesn't always work that way	2288	B
right	2288	B
right or at least loans that they pay off	2288	B
	2288	B
yeah yeah well	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
uh yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
sure	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
right	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
well you know the the	2288	B
i'm i'm also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them	2288	B
because uh when i grew up i had no	2288	B
no involvement in finances whatsoever you know and so when i became an adult and i was responsible for	2288	B
for the money i had no skills and no background and no tools and and uh so we had to learn it the hard way and and um	2288	B
so we we're trying to get the kids involved with that that you know when they get an allowance uh part of that's supposed to go to savings for instance	2288	B
and uh um yeah and they understand our eh the process- our process	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
oh yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
oh	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
sure	2288	B
<silence>	2288	B
right	2288	B
yeah	2288	B
<silence>	2279	B
oh uh-huh	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
well no they wouldn't would they no	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
well both of mine are boys they're eight and eleven	2279	B
and we're into sports i mean as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
uh baseball has started	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
oh oh yes we start here at uh five	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
up until it's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May so he's going to be with uh regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching	2279	B

<silence>	2279	B
uh-huh	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
you know i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often	2279	B
and that must be the thing they really hadn't either they went to the Memorial you know because when they go it's on business it's not really just to getting to sight see	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
oh i bet it is too	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
uh-huh	2279	B
oh now my husband and i we go different places but our children- but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close	2279	B

<silence>	2279	B

yeah you have to i mean you honestly do now i have friends that i love to death but and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them and	2279	B
you know to do it and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying well i work full time too you know	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
yeah oh yeah	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
uh-huh	2279	B

<silence>	2279	B
yeah	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
yeah	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
uh-huh yeah uh i agree with you very much so now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew	2279	B
time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
yes	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
uh-huh yeah	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
that's right but you can't take this money with us though that's how i keep looking at it	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
oh yes yeah	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
uh-huh	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B

well maybe something will open up for you	2279	B
<silence>	2279	B
uh-huh	2279	B
well maybe- well i've enjoyed talking to you okay bye-bye	2279	B
	2279	B
<silence>	2279	A
okay well personally i don't have any children i'm twenty two and i'm doing my Master's at NC State so uh uh children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
so what what how do you spend the time with your children	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
oh	2279	A
okay and they	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
what what are you doing	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
oh okay do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
okay and and in in in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
okay	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
oh okay	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah i i used to play soccer when i was that age up in New York so	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah and how about how about like on the weekends do you do sports or do you go out	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
do you go uh how about like for uh do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off	2279	A
in the summer or like in the Easter time like around now	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
and where do you go	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
have have you been out of the country	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
oh okay well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave i mean i i lived in places like when i lived in Washington uh Washington DC i never went to the Washington Memorial and then when i went back to visit i went to the Washington Memorial	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
right	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
right well it's it's a beautiful city and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to Las Vegas and that was the most boring place on earth	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah did uh did like did you go to Disneyland	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
oh okay so but um now i don't know but um but let's see when i was eleven i went also to the Caribbean	2279	A
that that was fun that was and uh then after that i my sister lives in Turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to Turkey and this Christmas i went to Turkey but basically	2279	A
it's uh for the past couple of years uh i since my parents are are well i'm from Argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling i do is alone	2279	A
and uh we were never much of uh a very uh family thing you know may like go skiing in Vermont or something	2279	A
that was uh that was a lot of fun but what happens is we used to fight a lot so there's never much of a family family thing you know one of those hell family vacations	2279	A
	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things and	2279	A
and and to me you know it's like now i'm twenty two but i still feel you know it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very	2279	A
hard for me because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old	2279	A
and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it's like	2279	A
i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry you know it's like	2279	A
you know i love you and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it you know	2279	A
and so that's uh that the same- thing that you know its like when like like i've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything	2279	A
they uh they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning	2279	A
you know and uh i was brought up the same way if if it doesn't matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house	2279	A
yeah	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah yeah but uh it's just it's just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well what i'll do is you know it like	2279	A
i mean you might have a problems but it's not your kids problems you know and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if	2279	A
if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem	2279	A
you know and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem you know	2279	A
and that's uh that's very that's very hard to do because once you're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah my my father was raising four kids- oh well three kids before he had me so it was uh	2279	A
you know you're trying to support uh four kids and it's pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids	2279	A
he goes yeah but then i wouldn't have you i go yeah but then you would have a lot of money you know	2279	A
yeah	2279	A
	2279	A
but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially_1 when you consider like especially_1 for for me which i'm paying out of state tuition i'm paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester	2279	A
and uh you know people say you know it's expensive for to send kids to college but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it's like what what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home	2279	A
you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books	2279	A
but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
i mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
oh oh excuse me	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
well i i'm doing computer science computer engineering	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah and and now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home	2279	A
because since i'm an international student they want to send me back to Argentina well my dad wants me to go back so	2279	A
no no because if you go back there then you can never get out	2279	A
like you don't have any money to to get out	2279	A
so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my God you know i go back there and then and then i might get married there and then i will have kids there and then i'll never leave the place you know	2279	A
yeah i know and that's that's what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that	2279	A
his life just went down the drain so	2279	A
<silence>	2279	A
yeah i i've been calling a lot of companies there some of them are interested well at least for a year and a half i can work so	2279	A
i'll do it	2279	A
all right same here bye-bye	2279	A
	2279	A
-okay	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yep	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
well i don't know about_1 North Carolina but	2271	A
well actually North Carolina- i think North Carolina's gonna to do pretty good i think they'll go to the finals	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
i know Arkansas was good i can't believe	2271	A
i can't	2271	A
yeah i can't believe they beat Arkansas i thought Arkansas would go all the way to the finals	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
i -don't know	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
 they beat Duke's ass last year	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
 yeah	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
 think so really	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah like the Hornets anyone can beat the Hornets	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah me too i like uh	2271	A
oh the	2271	A
um	2271	A
Magic	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
AC Green's pretty good	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
um-hum	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
i'm not much of a NBA- NBA fan	2271	A
myself	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
oh no sure don't	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
uh-huh	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah didn't know that	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
huh	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
huh	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
well he made it	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
hm hm so how about_1 what do you think who do you think's gonna win the final	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah i watched the	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah they can keep on the pressure all the whole game	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
pretty good	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
Duke'll be mighty mad though	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
oh yeah well the disgrace they won't lose- lose last year	2271	A
	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
um yeah	2271	A
with Kareem	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
been a while since they had the straight winner	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
huh	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
yeah like Jordan	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
huh	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
okay	2271	A
<silence>	2271	A
all right you too thanks bye	2271	A
	2271	A
all right there we go	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
so what's- what's your prediction on North Carolina and Duke	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
i mean my gosh uh look who Kansas beat to get to meet North Carolina i mean they they beat uh Arkansas	2271	B
and they beat and they beat Indiana- they beat Indiana they creamed Indiana	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
well i i thought so too they they just had a letdown in the second half and they couldn't recover	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
well UNLV- they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
yeah big time i i'll bet they could hold their own in the NBA	2271	B
seriously	2271	B
i i bet there're some teams they could beat	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
yeah- possibly	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
yeah actually i'm kind of a Lakers fan myself	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
oh yeah him and Worthy and uh	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
yeah yeah he's good coming off the bench now of course the other- they got Sam Perkins	2271	B
and that that helps	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
oh okay well you remember Sam Perkins when he was in North Carolina don't you	2271	B
see he was a teammate with James Worthy and Michael Jordan	2271	B
the the three of those guys were the three pillars of the national championship team North Carolina had back in eighty two i think when Jordan was just a freshman	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
yeah in fact uh Jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point	2271	B
with like sixteen seconds to go	2271	B
they- they gave him the ball he took the shot if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it he's a goat he made it	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
yep	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
well i really don't think anybody- anybody can beat UNLV they they might beat themselves but i don't know they're at such a high level of intensity	2271	B
they- they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to have a really on day and if that if both of those happened at the same time	2271	B
you might have an upset	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
 yep yep they're absolutely relentless	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
 well they're so close to an undefeated- undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don't think they're gonna lack for motivation	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
 well i mean it's it's no disgrace to lose in the final four	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
well UNLV's kind of in a different league from everybody else it it's kind of similar to back when UCLA was winning seven titles in a row from sixty seven to seventy three back then they they called the invitational-	2271	B
well with him yeah and with Bill Walton	2271	B
and they used to call it the uh the UCLA invitational	2271	B
because_1 they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
yeah i- i don't know that any one team's gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
uh partly because the really outstanding- many of the really outstanding players leave college before they turn seniors	2271	B
so you don't yeah- yeah so you don't really get to keep the the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years	2271	B
<silence>	2271	B
well this has been fun i've enjoyed talking with you	2271	B
God bless and you have a good day now bye-bye	2271	B
	2271	B
well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and Dallas Morning News	2205	A
and i try to look at it if i get busy i don't get a chance to pick it up like this week i noticed several copies have been untouched- haven't been touched but uh	2205	A
 well not in the morning but um if the well i have two son- children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll	2205	A
you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
well we i don't take like Time or Newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch um CNN i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at	2205	A
like the nine o'clock PM and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
well he didn't have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
uh-huh	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
uh-huh	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
uh-huh	2205	A
well i wouldn't think that- i would really say that that's not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates	2205	A
and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but you'll have a variety to choose from	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
 yeah i do too do you ever listen to the radio or any	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
no i don't	2205	A
hum i really um have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music and um	2205	A
 yeah my husband does and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it's something really interesting and and then i'll know to	2205	A
to keep an eye out for it but i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
uh-huh	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
 do you have a particular local channel that you watch on television	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um well i am we're fairly new to the area and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the um anchors	2205	A
are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon Protestant type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer	2205	A
a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
yes i have and um i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you're more more likely to get	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
yeah	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
oh really	2205	A
well we you know like all of the stations seem to be pretty good it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into Houston so we had a	2205	A
a favorite or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news i guess because_1 you get use to you like the anchors and you feel comfortable with them and	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
um-hum	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
that's true their job	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
 that's true so that really effects how they report the news	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
 with is he the sports	2205	A
<silence>	2205	A
yes i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed but i have yes it's nice bye-bye	2205	A
	2205	A
<silence>	2205	B
well do you have time to read the paper in the morning	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
you know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all we we took the Morning News for a while and then uh well we've been taking the Times Herald for ages and then	2205	B
	2205	B
	2205	B
to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
well any you know Time magazine and even the news that sometimes that that's why i like some diversity the idea that i we have Time which which we we take from time to time	2205	B
 and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we're taking that and and we also hit the Garland	2205	B
Garland Daily News i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or something- but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh this	2205	B
as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial	2205	B
and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
yes	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
 yes and i- i thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a	2205	B
a ploy which was um i- i find that fascinating that uh	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
i listen to KRLD and uh KLIF the news talk radio and i actually listen to CNN radio do you know it was on radio now	2205	B
 it's on eleven ninety	2205	B
	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
well when i go to work i listen	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
yeah	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
well with with your you know if you're around the home though and and and can watch TV and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything	2205	B
and and so it's kind of a oh that's what's interesting is the CNN uh i don't think i'm trying to think if it's much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i i'm i'm inveterate switcher	2205	B
	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
well i watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i'm not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then	2205	B
they've been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the i- i don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
 i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting that	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can uh i- i- i grew up in Alabama and so i- i have some prejudices	2205	B
but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station uh i'm not sure i i'm	2205	B
totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that uh in some cases there- there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and	2205	B
and this kind of thing and i think that Dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to Saint Louis and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think Dallas really does have	2205	B
have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh ABC affiliate in the US i think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
where'd you move from	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
 yeah	2205	B
it is interesting though it becomes a little of personality in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so	2205	B
twenty four anyway long time ago and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago	2205	B
and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too anyway didn't he didn't have the personality and wasn't drawing the crowds and that's interesting is that's that's what the TV stations do they're trying to get ratings	2205	B
and i think if we remember that that they're out after the ratings	2205	B
and some well it's like the the Dale Hansen on channel eight little- is a sometimes a little too cutesy but i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes	2205	B
<silence>	2205	B
 okay well good talking to you good night	2205	B
	2205	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
okay	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
well it's it's a real mixed um	2284	B
feeling about it uh	2284	B
it's really good that we did well and that uh	2284	B
we we went in and did what we set out to do i i have there's- there's been like a lot of things said about if it was a political	2284	B
well- if it was a war for oil or a a war for ideals and seems to be real mixed between those two things	2284	B
um	2284	B
i don't know i think the	2284	B
the the guy should have been ousted out of there and now we don't seem to be as interested in in doing what's right	2284	B
as we were when we started the whole thing	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
Yale yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
it's-	2284	B
it's	2284	B
it's a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up that's for sure	2284	B
it doesn't it's they have far too much influence over there and they're so unstable that it makes it hard for um	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
it-	2284	B
it makes it hard for us to deal with them	2284	B
i have that same problem at work-	2284	B
	2284	B
	2284	B
productive	2284	B
and	2284	B
	2284	B
i can understand why he he felt he needed to go over there on the other hand it's too bad that he couldn't use this i- i- i know that oil's real important to our life style but it's too bad he couldn't use this as	2284	B
a launch to say let's conserve more because_1 he never said that	2284	B
during the whole war he never put out like a conservation- a conservation effort for oil	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
um-hum	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
 right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
oh yeah it's	2284	B

	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
i know i agree	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
well you can't yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
that's where i got to too the first i got chills up and down when i heard the on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah exactly-	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
oh	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
 right it will be	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
i guess so	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah we talked-	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
 oh yeah well- yeah one one guy i talked to about about_1 colleges he was very opinionated and	2284	B
it was difficult	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah real thick	2284	B
yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah i think they're versions of that	2284	B
yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
right	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
yeah i'm in Dallas i didn't know that people from other parts of the country were doing this	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
no my husband does	2284	B
yeah	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
oh no	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
	2284	B
<silence>	2284	B
okay all right thanks bye-bye	2284	B
	2284	B
	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
okay what	2284	A
opinion do you have about what was what happened	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
yeah see i feel like i don't know i feel like the	2284	A
motivation Bush is a member of the Trilateral Commission and he's a member he was a member of the Skull and Bones at i think at Princeton or Yale i'm not Yale	2284	A
and uh his motivations are i don't feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the motivation- the true motivation he talks a lot about the new world order	2284	A
and most Americans probably don't really know what that would mean and i maybe i'm being maybe i'm assuming too much- no i don't think most would i really don't and so i feel like the real motivation was something that	2284	A
uh most people would have absolutely no idea and that that motivation is to um you know to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the Middle East will	2284	A
so that they will submit under the uh one world order i mean that's what i felt so i'm like going hum am i glad we went over there and did that um i think God's ultimately in charge and	2284	A
you know i'm not afraid of what they've done i'm not afraid of Saddam Hussein i feel he's lost and you know he needs to get saved just like the everybody else but	2284	A
you know i just i guess i have kind of like hum kind of real cautious in the whole thing because i know that there's a motive that hasn't been openly discussed or revealed to anybody and uh that's where that's why i really don't have a real	2284	A
set opinion because i don't know everything i don't much- you could watch news all the time but you don't know anything hardly and he did talk about that though he did uh he at least he did mention it	2284	A
you know what i'm saying i don't think most people understand what he's talking about when he talks about that new world order	2284	A
so i don't know what do you think of that	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
uh-huh	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
uh-huh yeah	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
uh-huh	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum but the motivation though see wasn't didn't have anything i don't believe it had anything to do with the oil because	2284	A
i think i i feel like the real- the real motivation of the war was to break up that Arab power not	2284	A
to disperse the oil but to they were a big problem for the the unifying of the EEC the European Economic Community which are gonna become i- i- i mean they're gonna be	2284	A
they're gonna put us under if we don't become part of the new world order next year the United States if we don't	2284	A
i mean we're going to be in big trouble because when Europe unites- unites that's why TI's building plants in Italy because_1 they're going to have power like we can't imagine	2284	A
and so the i think Bush wanted to break up this other power thing	2284	A
and it looks real good but in the end	2284	A
i just see that ultimately who's going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is is George Bush really any better than Saddam Hussein or does he just look better do you know what i'm saying i mean i think one person	2284	A
in power that's not really seeking God and wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very dangerous and i don't see that this one world this new world order that him and Gorbachev keep talking about i just don't see that um	2284	A
that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know	2284	A
get more power over that Arab	2284	A
lands when they try and next year really start pushing this new world order well he talks about it all the time i mean	2284	A
i mean that's all he talks about but anyway there's a good book by Larry Abraham um you probably have heard of None Dare Call It Treason and Call it Conspiracy	2284	A
well anyway Call it Conspiracy is a real good book and he talks a lot about this i've heard him interviewed some so i think it's kind of interesting but anyway he probably has a new book out that i don't know about yet because_1 i haven't heard him in a while but	2284	A
i don't know so that's kind of my thing on the war i'm kind of like nah it's all power plays you know there's so much stuff going on we don't know about	2284	A
you know i'm like going hey Peter Jennings you know he knows a little bit but	2284	A
he doesn't even-	2284	A
i mean we would all die if we knew what was really going on i mean all of America would probably go into coronary attack well they would	2284	A
oh my money's in the stock market oh i can't believe they're doing this but it doesn't change anything so i'm just like	2284	A
i don't know just i mean i would probably- most people probably think i don't even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there's so much going on	2284	A
that you know hey i'm going to pray about it and if i feel led to vote for a certain person i'm going to do it but i'm not going to get all up tight about all this	2284	A
and stuff you know hum-um because_1 i know at first we were watching the news a lot and man it was like gosh- we were like all the time and i thought gee you know God's going to protect Israel i mean he starts	2284	A
he starts nuking Israel man he's in big trouble i mean we'll just we'll hear about it you know what i mean if anything major happens we're going to find out so let's chill out and just do what we need to do so	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
um-hum	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
i know it was kind of exciting at first but and then i know the first night of the bombing we had it was a Wednesday and we had home church and we had a surprise birthday party planned for a sixteen year old	2284	A
and so when we you know we're on the way to home church and the bombing's just begun you know and we go into this birthday party for a surprise party	2284	A
and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and it was like kind of sad- it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war and so	2284	A
so imagine the sixteen year old yep boy i had a surprise birthday party and a war started in Israel	2284	A
that'll be a good story when she's thirty won't it	2284	A
well- well anyway well i guess do you think we're finished	2284	A
i think so too i don't know if we did what we were supposed to but yeah we did they can do a lot of research- we get along good too some of the callers you don't along with that good you know you have you know what i'm saying	2284	A
isn't that funny i bet they're going to do a lot of research on that	2284	A
i know	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
uh-huh	2284	A
really he probably had those glasses on like you know those Annie Hall kind of glasses i don't know what you call it John Lennon glasses that's what they are the women i call Annie Hall glasses but	2284	A
is i don't know if they're Annie Hall glasses or not i just i don't know i always think of Annie Hall when i see them_1 but	2284	A
really i know the female version of John Lennon's but	2284	A
i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and they're pretty interesting but yeah they're real opinionated but i guess that's better than nothing you know	2284	A
but anyway- yeah it's been interesting though all these different people and some of them_1 are real friendly you know and it's like yeah man when i come to Dallas i'll call you you know and then others of them_1 are like they just wanna go but then some of them_1 have babies crying in the background too so	2284	A
there may be other reason than you know that but well anyway are you in Dallas	2284	A
<silence>	2284	A
yeah i had a guy from Rhode Island that we talked about fishing so and uh oh i had some- i've had people in Massachusetts and Vermont they work at TI up there do you work at TI	2284	A
see mine does too in Dallas and um yeah but no there's there's TI's up in Rhode Island and stuff and that guy talked about fishing and i asked him if he took his wife and	2284	A
and then he didn't have a wife and i felt bad but well i'm sorry and he goes we're divorced well i'm sorry it was real sad but he was pretty nice and stuff and then him and my husband started talking salary	2284	A
	2284	A
if anything happens interesting in the war maybe they'll have another thing and we'll get you again all right bye	2284	A
	2284	A
<silence>	2244	B
um i don't know i- i think i make things you know that i do things kind of simple because_1 i- i you know i just have close friends over i make like lasagna and uh	2244	B
oh we like to have barbecues outside so you know when the weather's nice because_1 in Texas you have a lot of nice weather so we do a lot of um things like that um	2244	B
i'm not really into gourmet cooking so i don't know how to do that so i don't have gourmet foods	2244	B
<silence>	2244	B
um yeah you know like fajitas and- and stuff like that so	2244	B
<silence>	2244	B
um it's kind of like made out of skirt steak and you marinate it	2244	B
you can buy marinating mixes here i don't know if get it up there or you can you know marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like and then you um	2244	B
 you quick fry it real fast with- in hot	2244	B
hot grease you know not a whole- not not deep frying it but you can either barbecue it which is really good	2244	B
with uh green beans not green beans but green peppers and red peppers and onions	2244	B
 and um then you put it on a flour like you know you make your meat real um	2244	B
thin you know bite size pieces	2244	B
then you put it on flour tortillas with you know guacamole and um	2244	B
 sour cream and	2244	B
you know all kinds of you know kind- it's like a Tex-Mex type thing	2244	B
it's really good you can do it with chicken too chicken fajitas and stuff	2244	B
 so	2244	B
<silence>	2244	B
so what kind of cooking do you do up there	2244	B
<silence>	2244	B

yeah	2244	B
<silence>	2244	B
yeah it's been fun it's been nice- it's uh you know neat to learn some what different people eat so	2244	B

oh well basically um because i lived in the Middle East for a while i tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when i have have people over	2244	A
and so um some of the dips are like um chick peas mashed with um sesame	2244	A
	2244	A
that's right that's right it's called humus now i remember it and um uh dipping Arabic bread the thin pita bread in that	2244	A
or another dip is made with very similar but with um eggplant which has been	2244	A
actually barbecued- it ends up with a barbecued taste although we usually bake it in the oven or if we have uh those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just by putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it	2244	A
black on the outside but mushy on the inside	2244	A
<silence>	2244	A
	2244	A
<silence>	2244	A

the solution was ridiculous i had it figured out by the third	2245	B
i thought i already had it figured out and i did and that made me mad	2245	B

<silence>	2245	B
oh yeah i watch- oh i like C i like CNN's new uh news coverage better than anybody's	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
yeah during- during when the war was real hot and heavy we just had it on CNN all day long	2245	B
yeah oh the oh much better than anybody else's	2245	B
	2245	B
now they're plus they had all the inaccuracies were ridiculous- then they'd come back five minutes later and contradict themselves to oh it was just get it was ridiculous so i just	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
um-hum	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
yeah oh yeah	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B

uh-huh	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
oh yeah	2245	B

rehash- it was just rehash rehash- total- oh	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
nothing and i- i know i know the scud attack- scud attacks are some- are exciting to somebody but after you've seen them_1 seen them_1 for two weeks in a row	2245	B
	2245	B
across the black sky a white streak	2245	B
	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
well maybe maybe we're a bit uh uh	2245	B
oh	2245	B
jaded	2245	B
and and because television's brought everything into your living room	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
but it wasn't an exciting war it really wasn't	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
which is that's good that's good but	2245	B
for TV coverage it's pitiful	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
oh	2245	B
oh	2245	B

and they kept having her on the news every night	2245	B
uh-huh ooh she's she's	2245	B
in hot water	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
oh yeah oh yeah	2245	B
<silence>	2245	B
oh yes	2245	B
	2245	B
nobody forced	2245	B
<silence>	2245	A
well what's your favorite shows	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
uh-huh	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
hm	2245	A
uh-huh that's one of my favorite	2245	A
yeah Mystery and uh Masterpiece Theater	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
um-hum	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah i don't not anymore i don't there's just nothing on it	2245	A
i got i got sort of hooked on that uh Dark Shadows	2245	A
yeah i when i watched it originally i didn't know it was a i don't know it was going to be a series i thought it was just a movie	2245	A
and so i started watching it and all of a sudden stay tuned next week and i went what	2245	A
and then it blows into this whole series thing so i sort of had to stay with it	2245	A
not really it it it's it's gotten to the point it's getting ridiculous now and	2245	A
they they just had the uh season finale and i don't i don't know what they accomplished but i think the writers just	2245	A
figure well let's just do anything and	2245	A
we'll we'll have a couple of months to come up with some new ideas	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah i don't like programs that i can figure it out	2245	A
um the only one that i watch religiously is LA Law	2245	A
i really like that	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah that's that's my favorite	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
well i'm i'm a struggling law student	2245	A
 and	2245	A
i the reason i like it is because they give you good law in there	2245	A
yeah it's not like these other programs where they just make up anything they want	2245	A
and they they throw little tidbits out that are really good	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
um-hum of course i mean it's got its bad side so it's limited by the format and obviously you don't get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do i mean	2245	A
they're they're in California and they're- they're waiting list is about four years four or five years for a civil case	2245	A
so uh	2245	A
i mean you know it's very difficult to	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah it would yeah	2245	A
no not at all you know the wheels of justice grind slowly	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah i'll agree with you there	2245	A
i'll agree with you	2245	A
i know i know the shortcomings too	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
uh well not it's not on my that's not on my list of	2245	A
now there was some of the some of the classes i'm in i think i'm in Sesame Street but uh	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
that's it i mean Big Bird would make a good judge	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
better than some of the judges i've seen	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah i've got my own pet peeve about judges but uh	2245	A
oh well we're stuck with them_1	2245	A
sort of like lawyers you know	2245	A
	2245	A
um let's see what else is oh i like A&E	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
they don't have A&E on cable in Dallas	2245	A
 uh-huh	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
oh	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
oh	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah i'll tell you	2245	A
 the um	2245	A
uh A&E and Discovery and CNN i couldn't i couldn't live without those	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
oh yeah i- i just leave it when i'm home during the day i just leave it on just to listen to it	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah best coverage	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
uh the networks got sort of ridiculous with they they they felt like they had to interrupt normal programming for all this but they didn't have anything to say	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
oh yeah	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
well the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway i mean	2245	A
it it it got far more coverage than it should have i it was it was beautifully played out thing i mean	2245	A
it it roused the patriotism of the of the country and all that sort of stuff and	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah exactly i mean and sometimes they they they would now i like Jeopardy and Jeopardy comes on here at seven o'clock	2245	A
and for i don't know it must have been two or three weeks there they were doing this expanded nightly news	2245	A
you know and i'm going i will never get to see Jeopardy again	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
i'm saying what are you telling me that you didn't tell me in your first half hour	2245	A
nothing	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
oh well there goes a patriot missile oh well that's good that's good	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah oh boy golly gee	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah we are	2245	A
	2245	A
yeah well i- it was interesting- it was interesting-	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
no i mean there there	2245	A
there was nothing to it	2245	A
i mean	2245	A
i mean yeah i'm happy for that	2245	A
i'm happy for that but but unfortunately i sort of had the inside track because i'd been in the i'd been in the military for thirteen years and i worked- and i worked in intelligence	2245	A
and and there was no	2245	A
yes another one of those military intelligence ha ha that's what that's just like justice for all	2245	A
 but i mean my goodness there's they're sitting here making all this big deal out of the Iranians	2245	A
and i'm sitting there thinking to myself uh-huh sure	2245	A
i mean they've poured billions of dollars into this stuff but those stupid people can't read comic strips i mean how do you expect them to operate tanks	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
i mean	2245	A
they can't even read their own language	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah i it just totally ridiculous i mean the Israeli's could have fixed the whole problem years ago if they just sent sent their guys in there and killed Saddam	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
that's right i mean the Israeli's aren't	2245	A
they're not afraid of anything	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
see what happens when they when they take a plane load of their citizens down in	2245	A
that doesn't uh that doesn't that situation doesn't sit around and develop very long	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
all right i- i- i think everybody's jumping to conclusions i don't think anything's going to change	2245	A
no first off i don't think the the Middle Eastern situation's going to change i don't think that	2245	A
they're not	2245	A
yeah they're not going to come up with	2245	A
they're not going to come up with a peace plan or any of this kind of crap	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
um-hum	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
yeah	2245	A
	2245	A
	2245	A
yeah really and it was it was real- it was even worse here in North Carolina because_1 because a lot of the	2245	A
matter of fact all the units the Marines and and uh the F the F-16 squadrons came out of North Carolina	2245	A
so every night on the local news they were down in Fayetteville or they were down in Goldsboro and they were talking to the military wives you know	2245	A
and and	2245	A
i and i understand the way they feel about their	2245	A
husbands and wives being over there and all that but to get on camera and just oh this is so terrible i just i don't know what we're gonna do well i'm thinking to myself	2245	A
you know what do these people think they were getting into when they joined the military	2245	A
you know i'm going it what did you think it was	2245	A
a paycheck	2245	A
you know run around and and play soldier	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
well the reservists sure do we had a reservist here in North Carolina who who	2245	A
who's unit was ordered up and he refused to go	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
i hope he got busted	2245	A
yeah the uh this this guy did too he ended up going to Leavenworth	2245	A
which is good i'm glad	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
um-hum	2245	A
and then and then she	2245	A
that's right then she didn't want to do her obligation yeah	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
well i you know i'm not i'm not racist or anything but one of my one -another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of Black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the Blacks are poor and therefore they don't have a choice but go in the military	2245	A
so there's more of them getting killed than the Whites	2245	A
now to me that doesn't make any damn sense	2245	A
<silence>	2245	A
	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
well i think we need to do more i- i mean i know i need to do more they have programs around where you can reach they uh	2299	B
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them_1 bundled up	2299	B
but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet so	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah well i don't i don't get the paper every day but i you know i get it on i i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the Sunday edition so	2299	B
but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk every- you know every Monday or every other Monday and	2299	B
have them_1 pick that up but that's the extent of what i've done i'd like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go	2299	B
you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah i'm not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is but you know sometimes it's just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
do those can crushers work good	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah because_1 those things i think would just snap you know	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
oh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
i'd i'd have to check into something like that because_1 i mean we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but um	2299	B
you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah	2299	B
so i don't know i don't think you have to to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
i need to look into it more you know it's	2299	B
you know it sometimes even with the newspaper they say only they'll only take certain types of paper you know they won't take paper that's shiny	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah so does my husband yeah	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah i don't know what you know i haven't i'm sure they're probably doing that here some	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh i think it's necessary i- i like it you know it makes i think it's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal they're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and	2299	B
and i've bought you know i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and i think they're just fine	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
yeah	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah i think i think we're getting becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more so	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
no no	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah	2299	B
yeah <b_aside> girls put that away <e_aside>	2299	B
<b_aside> now <e_aside>	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah i just wish it was a little more convenient- convenient to do you know	2299	B
seems like you're so busy anyway and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about so	2299	B
i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so	2299	B
but yeah	2299	B
yeah yeah get the kids interested in it too so	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
that's right	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
that's right who does that you know people don't have room for that kind of stuff	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
no and in Texas they're just get things like that they just get bugs in them_1 so	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
so you don't	2299	B
that's right so	2299	B
i'm pretty lazy about it right now everything goes into one thing and goes out to the you know pick it up so	2299	B
oh	2299	B
uh-huh	2299	B
yeah well i need to get better- get better at it so	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah that's right that's right	2299	B
hm	2299	B
that's true	2299	B
that's right	2299	B
<silence>	2299	B
yeah	2299	B
well thank you for calling i	2299	B
okay take care	2299	B
bye-bye	2299	B
	2299	B
	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
so what do you think about it how are we doing in recycling are we	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
um-hum	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah and see i do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot	2299	A
but there's still a lot more we can do you know i don't recycle my newspapers myself but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a	2299	A
like a a	2299	A
clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there and tie them all up and bundle them up so i figured i might get me one of those	2299	A
because we don't always read the newspaper sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it	2299	A
	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah see and	2299	A
yeah see and here in Lubbock everything's so close i can imagine what it's like up there	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah see i went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall	2299	A
and then i put me a little five gallon bucket and it's just outside the garage door so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah i got one from Payless Cashways and it's actually metal	2299	A
it's not plastic i didn't want to buy a plastic one	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah but Payless Cashways has them and they're metal and i don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there but it was only like seven dollars not too bad	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
so	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah i don't yeah i don't think it would crush steel cans it's pretty tough	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
no you could probably just you know	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
they won't yeah they won't take any lint free paper or see i work at TI	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
and we do a lot of recycling out there now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but that's just now come on board	2299	A
you know we've been throwing paper out there away for years and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out you know	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah i'm sure they are TI is doing it pretty well nationwide i'm sure	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
oh yeah	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah i bought a i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work it's his birthday we're pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag	2299	A
and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and it's just a paper bag	2299	A
you know and it's really cute	2299	A
but i think we're doing better and better all the time i still don't	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
no there's not going to be any room shortly	2299	A
you know i don't know what New York does about theirs i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah so but i think we're getting better at it i think there's quite a bit more we could do	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
but you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would would be worth but	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah it sure is	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
yeah well they'll get at it sooner i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later they-	2299	A
you know they have we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans	2299	A
you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them_1 for us there no- there's no problem there but what do you do with them in the meantime now i don't want a can a garage full of cans	2299	A
	2299	A
you know	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
no they're just not they're not prepared for it	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah yeah they do and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that's for sure	2299	A
so	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
yeah	2299	A
yeah myself about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans	2299	A
so	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way you know	2299	A
if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then	2299	A
we'll get there	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
well thank you for talking to me	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
sure no problem	2299	A
all righty bye-bye	2299	A
<silence>	2299	A
	2299	A
 okay	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum kind of like a domino's effect	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
no	2228	A
no no	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it	2228	A
or within i think people just started	2228	A
you know not- not being as careful with the loans that they were making	2228	A
whenever	2228	A
you- you know whenever they gave them out	2228	A
i think maybe they didn't check into them enough	2228	A
or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so	2228	A
yeah	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
 i'm not sure	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum i know well i'm um i know a little bit about it but i don't as much as i should know about it i'm a finance major here at Clarion	2228	A
and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars	2228	A
so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
no i don't think so	2228	A
and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make	2228	A
and i think the S and L's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make	2228	A
and i think if they would be more bound	2228	A
to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um	2228	A
 i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it wasn't making it wasn't as good news as it was i think it's still adding- you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and L's still open	2228	A
and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
i- i don't know i think- i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
 oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just reading- i think it was in Venezuela i can't remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back	2228	A
you know and they just they just wrote it right off	2228	A
i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
um-hum yeah because_1 we're- we're you know we're talking about some companies that have just	2228	A
like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more	2228	A
they just totally wrote it off their book	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing	2228	A
um it it's just it's just for you know safe purposes	2228	A
you know in case something would happen um	2228	A
yeah as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
right	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
 yeah	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
i think it could happen yeah	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
i think it'll happen again but i think it'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again	2228	A
because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future	2228	A
but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean you're gonna have to take some risks	2228	A
and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
um-hum	2228	A
<silence>	2228	A
	2228	B
all right	2228	B
uh feelings on what caused the S and L	2228	B
crisis	2228	B
 i guess i don't	2228	B
have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where	2228	B
loan were made that appear to be	2228	B
a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during	2228	B
the Reagan eight years	2228	B
uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans	2228	B
and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
right i- i don't have a a field for whether or not	2228	B
this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome	2228	B
uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever	2228	B
uh i vaguely recall but i've never gone and and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years	2228	B
where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i don't have a real since	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour	2228	B
maybe	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
uh-huh	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
yeah	2228	B
it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people	2228	B
making loans and business decisions	2228	B
on a	2228	B
get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but	2228	B
if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making	2228	B
business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other company or	2228	B
i- i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move	2228	B
you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i	2228	B
i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing	2228	B
it	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
okay	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk	2228	B
oh okay	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
uh-huh	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
okay	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and	2228	B
nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that	2228	B
that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up	2228	B
it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your sense that that we now understand how bad it is	2228	B
or is there more to be heard yet	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet of the problem or whether it	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
uh-huh	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
to be caught in the land slide	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the the regular banks	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
it seems that i recall reading for the last	2228	B
oh let's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks	2228	B
of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela	2228	B
uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south	2228	B
resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done	2228	B
the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans	2228	B
i have this vague since that that could happen	2228	B
that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
um-hum	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
and so you think that it's just gone	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
okay	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
do you think it is necessary to have the	2228	B
federal guaranty program	2228	B
like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors	2228	B
which i don't think is what it was meant to do	2228	B
so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected	2228	B
the possibility exists for for these sorts of	2228	B
of problems	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
um	2228	B
so your since is that the	2228	B
that uh the	2228	B
the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money	2228	B
and given that the S and L's have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected	2228	B
and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of	2228	B
of dollars being protected	2228	B
it it seems like um there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts	2228	B
uh it's if if you take	2228	B
ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion- billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts	2228	B
and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and L's	2228	B
and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought	2228	B
you know that the for	2228	B
i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got	2228	B
accounts in thirty five different S and L's or	2228	B
thirty or forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government seems to me like they've gotten around what was intended to be the issue there	2228	B
uh-huh	2228	B
i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and L's and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt	2228	B
and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means means i'm not worried enough	2228	B
uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things	2228	B
<silence>	2228	B
uh-huh	2228	B
well perhaps if there are regulatory	2228	B
um	2228	B
constraints put back in place	2228	B
it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation	2228	B
uh	2228	B
<silence>	2238	B
wow that's great you're just getting all over the country aren't you	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
oh really	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
yes i am i am	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
well i didn't realize that i thought all of it was TI employees in the survey i- i didn't i was the other way around i thought- i didn't realize there were outside people in the survey so	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
um i am not positive um i- i probably have gotten about the same information you have because i don't work anywhere even near that division i'm in even even in a completely different site so	2238	B
i know that that once they get through with this i i've read where they're they may call certain- certain people back for like the second phase or something i'm but i'm not really sure i mean i know do- you know why they're you- gathering the information right	2238	B
oh you don't what they're what they're working on is uh the way i understand it is the computer system	2238	B
that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do	2238	B
you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that's why they're gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
right that's exactly right	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
direct a machine huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
um i'm in Lewisville which is just north of Dallas just about thirty minutes north of Dallas yeah so	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
did you	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
sure	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
yeah	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
yeah we really do we really do unless you're doing it	2238	B
first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening you know but it's that way anywhere	2238	B
there is there is it's that way anywhere you go	2238	B
yeah that's fine go ahead	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
oh my goodness	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
oh really	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
oh wow how wonderful	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
you sound like you've gotten very lucky you really have	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
yeah	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
good	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
yeah oh definitely we kind of went through a situation with my father my father was a um diabetic- he was pronounced a diabetic when he was thirty and uh had diabetes for all you know many many years and	2238	B
you know didn't take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have i mean he was put on insulin immediately but his diet he wasn't as careful with as he should have been in the beginning so he deteriorated rather quickly and	2238	B
by the time he was in his mid fifties which is very young he was he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and couldn't	2238	B
couldn't walk for very long periods of time the muscles in his neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had to have something to lean his head back against and and you know we were you know myself and my two sisters were	2238	B
you know in the situation of a a fifty seven year old father looking in to put him in a nursing home which was which was at fifty- i'm know it it's scary isn't it yeah i mean it was	2238	B
it was just a horrible situation for us to both- you know to be in and we just you know because of course like you say like your mother his mind was was perfect and wonderful it was he just could not get around to take care of himself	2238	B
and uh we ended up opting for um a live-in nurse and you know that came into his home and and we set her up a room in a spare room and she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine	2238	B
a fifty seven year old man in a nursing home we just you know we just could not could not imagine doing it	2238	B
and we knew that it wouldn't you know we couldn't even do the the live-in nurse thing forever you know and but he was just so against and and when you said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be it was such a different story because_1 he was	2238	B
so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can't blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was was just	2238	B
too much for him you know so we you know we opted for that route so i kind of know what you mean about the the trauma of you know the thought of doing it you know it was just	2238	B
it was just very hard but i guess you know there's there's there's good ones and there's bad ones i think you just have to be so very careful you know and	2238	B
you know you're lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is is still good and they can tell you if they're being well taken care of i think otherwise you you end up with serious problems	2238	B
you know	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
um-hum	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
well you know	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
that was another situation because my this was my father lived in Missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and uh we just got very very lucky and found a woman	2238	B
who was willing to do this and you know someone that we had known from you know had lived in town- you know that same town forever and we knew very well and we knew her history and we knew that she wasn't going to steal from him we knew that she would take good care of him and	2238	B
and we just got extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it and she stayed five days a week and spent the night	2238	B
but did go home on weekends and then we found another girl who had been kind of coming in and helping Dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that she was willing to stay on the weekends and help him	2238	B
so we just got extremely- we were like you only the other end we got extremely lucky all the way around that we were able to find somebody that would stay with him at home	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
well uh we only made- we only did that for um i guess that went on for about all not quite six months he passed away after six months there at home which	2238	B
we were very thankful that we were able to keep him at home and that you know he did pass away at home and uh rather than being in a nursing home i know he was much happier spending that six months at home	2238	B
you know definitely so	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh they were they had been divorced many years earlier yeah so he was he was alone and really had you know and	2238	B
and uh my uh youngest sister was um about an hour and a half away in college and uh i was you know down here six hundred miles away and then my the third sister was in Atlanta Georgia you know so we weren't really	2238	B
well we were even right there where we could take care of him you know so it was really a hard situation you know when in this society where everybody kind of gets spread out it's not as easy as it used to be to take care of aging parents you know it you know you-	2238	B
it's hard to move them_1 in with you or you move in with them or even you know drop in everyday you know you just	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
yeah	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
that's a that's a real trying experience to try to you know to move back in and and live harmoniously together after all those years it's	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
oh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
wonderful	2238	B
oh that's wonderful	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
um-hum	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
uh-huh	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
doesn't make it easy no	2238	B
<silence>	2238	B
oh	2238	B
no doubt no doubt	2238	B
in Carolina and i've had Baltimore Maryland so	2238	A
	2238	A
i'm a non Texas Instruments employee and i always- i always feel like when i get someone in Texas that you're probably employed by	2238	A
yeah well i was surprised that they had their people their own people in the survey but then why not	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
oh i see	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
uh do you know what they're doing with all this when they're finished	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
no i don't	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
oh i see	2238	A
uh	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
in other words they want to know if our voice can direct a machine	2238	A
	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
north of Dallas	2238	A
yeah we uh just came home from an expensive trip west and drove through the Dallas Fort Worth area without uh stopping for any reason whatsoever and i	2238	A
we're our town is five thousand so i was very concerned about what the trip the traffic would be like around Dallas Fort Worth and gosh we were through there before we even realized that we were in heavy traffic so you've got a good system	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
right	2238	A
 there is that time of day isn't there uh	2238	A
shall we get on to nursing homes	2238	A
okay	2238	A
	2238	A
uh my mother is seventy will be seventy nine years old this fall and has been a nursing home resident for nearly three years	2238	A
so uh i feel like i have uh	2238	A
my decision was not i did not make the decision to send her to a nursing home she made the decision that she could not any longer live in	2238	A
in her apartment by herself she had long since given up her home and gone into an apartment and of course that was her decision at the time too so	2238	A
and then in that we are in a small royal a rural community i think that makes such a difference too because	2238	A
well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home	2238	A
she- yes yes she wasn't at the time	2238	A
but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
well it just did a really marvelous thing and mother's mind is good it's her body that's bad and uh	2238	A
for- to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing home whose mind was not good and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something it just would all be so different	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
i'm fifty seven	2238	A
	2238	A
 right	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um	2238	A

<silence>	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
in our locality we have a lot of uh government services like the Home Health Care and etcetera etcetera which i'm sure they do in cities too	2238	A
but we do not have the staff to draw from- from to find someone who could stay for day in and day out with they- we just don't have those people	2238	A
they just are not available even though you would like to make that choice	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A

<silence>	2238	A
how long	2238	A
how long were you able to maintain that	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
oh uh-huh	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
yeah	2238	A
yeah	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
oh	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
um-hum your mother was not living or	2238	A
yeah yeah	2238	A
yeah	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
yeah	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
i just never considered the moving in with i could not ever have handled that my mother is incontinent and uh and i don't know i suppose that would have been my excuse uh	2238	A
but i don't think had that situation existed- not existed that i could have done that at all i'm not	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
i	2238	A
um-hum	2238	A
<silence>	2238	A
um-hum um-hum	2238	A
well i think my sister is an RN and lives in Knoxville Tennessee and i think that my mother had thought in the back of her mind that she perhaps might go to Jean's and it did take when she first went into the care- care center	2238	A
she just completely gave up uh just could not even sit up in the wheelchair without being tied in	2238	A
and that went on for almost six months and uh finally my sister came to visit and mother was talking about getting better and getting out of the care center	2238	A
and my sister is very blunt and she said mother this is going to be your home you might as well get used to it which i could not say to her	2238	A
and from that point on i think within the next six months she came to accept that as fact and then she began improving and is walking better now than she probably did in three years but	2238	A
still for the most part she is wheelchair bound or bed bound and um	2238	A
i don't know i guess maybe i have accepted that the nursing home is her home because i've started to decorate her room more than i ever did in the beginning so	2238	A
uh even though everyone knows that's the way it has to be you still it takes a little bit to accept	2238	A
no no and certainly it's very expensive there's no question about that	2238	A
but we had a severe ice	2238	A
<silence>	2289	A
okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary	2289	A
so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
yeah when- when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them_1 to a recycle thing we got like a penny a pound for them_1	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
oh my	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
wow i didn't i didn't realize you would think now up here	2289	A
i- i suppose they send it all back to the mill and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh actually there is one in northern Vermont so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here i didn't think that	2289	A
you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
do you have to buy metal copper is a very uh good one to collect even aluminum yeah so	2289	A
uh we do do recycling and our city will pick up our recyclables they have these little blue bins um i don't recycle personally i i'm saying i want to do it	2289	A
but i don't get a lot of magazines i don't get a i don't buy the newspaper but i do have a lot of uh my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cardboard- a lot of different papers and cardboards	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
yes but we have a bottle return a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles we've had five cent uh deposits on our bottles for years	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable it's great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it and it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
yeah	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
and recycle	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
but it takes away employment from the resource that its using	2289	A
i do too	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
uh they don't either	2289	A
yeah like i say it's not a very controversial thing everyone thinks we should do it	2289	A
it's just that we're so lazy i mean like personally i don't want to clean my i just have can cat food i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin	2289	A
you know i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
well i think i- i would be like when i bring my bottles back	2289	A
um if if if they're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months and i get a whole bunch of them_1 and bring them_1 over and bring them_1 over	2289	A
now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much but if	2289	A
if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it but um i produce quite a bit of trash my you know house	2289	A
and i see it but i don't see so much that i can recycle like i say it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard i'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper	2289	A
um pretty much and i and i don't know how they sort that but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would- i would have a recycling center	2289	A
but now it's just me and my husband so i don't know	2289	A
yeah i know what you're saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out	2289	A
instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them_1 at the end of the day they throw them_1 in the trash	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
um no we don't but other other offices do they have a box for papers	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
yeah	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
oh	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
well that's that's a really good idea because um like our uh fruit- fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit it	2289	A
they're- they're thinking about putting a deposit on them_1 because pretty much	2289	A
you have to you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because_1 most	2289	A
probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because_1 they're beer and soda but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have	2289	A
a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if it's got soda in it it does so it's a strange	2289	A
yeah they should they should clean clear that up it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda	2289	A
so but redemption centers are a big thing up here they get a penny a can they handle they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
yeah	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
is bottle- is bottle return down there a heated debate	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
oh yeah	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
well we well- well- well here you can't can't drink	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
well	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
yes well i know i was in Atlanta and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand but here let me put that in a paper cup for you so that was strange but	2289	A
i think if some people they have they say well we're not going to start a can deposit because_1 you have to get all these	2289	A
um uh the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it and their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits	2289	A
see how they handle it and see if it's a good way and then do it that way because as i like to say people are making money on it the cans do are worth something	2289	A
<silence>	2289	A
<silence>	2289	B
okay well is your does your city have mandatory recycling- uh recycling	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
um there there's some places that are strongly encouraging it then that the city will pick it up	2289	B
that's been one of the arguments here i'm just sitting here looking we've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff but we have to carry it	2289	B
um some distance and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables and um for example um our church was was collecting newspapers	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well it turns out that so much the problem in Texas is that uh they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to uh reprocess it	2289	B
that it requires an extremely- it requires uh essentially a paper mill to recycle it and so the value has gone down it turns out it wasn't worth it for the church to do	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well	2289	B
yeah well see that's in in Dallas there there no plan to build i think that there's some in East Texas there's some pulp	2289	B
mills but uh you have to go to Houston and uh it's interesting and then there's places that'll buy metal and they still buy aluminum can in fact that	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well do you do do you do recycling	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
oh	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
oh so it's worth taking them back well see we don't have we have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
oh that's interesting- you know that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh my mother sells um	2289	B
trees that they make paper out of and so every time i recycle newspapers	2289	B
uh in fact there's uh there's a uh Kimberly and Clark the the makers of kleenex and such	2289	B
has a uh a big uh paper mill that fact i almost went to work for them_1 i was offered a job and turned it down because_1 my mother got it for me but it's twenty or thirty miles from my house every time you recycle that's one less tree my mother can sell and uh	2289	B
so it's a question should i be diligent and um um	2289	B
and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood	2289	B
but it it it's an interesting point though that uh you know everybody's so anxious to recycle and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment but uh	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well but in general i think it's a good idea because there's like the glass uh you can't argue that the glass it doesn't biodegrade and and uh the plastics obviously they don't	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
so we might as well recycle those	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
yeah	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well that's what we've got ours we we started about New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious we took one load over there and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff and	2289	B
you know it it it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
yeah	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
but every little bit helps right	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
what-	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well do you have separate trash cans at your desk	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well we have we have one that's recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and and waste food and and they gave us a list of things that aren't recycle- and it turns out it's not so bad i- i- i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic	2289	B
or plastic- like Saran Wrap or something anyway and then uh and cardboard there's a few interesting that we're we're recycling computer type paper	2289	B
and and and uh one day they'll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper and then the next day they'll pick up the other so	2289	B
depending on how much uh you know and there's a lot of uh actually it works pretty well and then we have uh uh waste	2289	B
uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work and so	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
oh	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
yeah	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
that's an interesting distinction that	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
yeah	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well see well see those of us that don't have state income taxes yet that's the big debate here in Texas that they their the legislature wants to put one in and it's interesting what people get upset about uh	2289	B
it it really is the the	2289	B
well no the the big issue was is is uh when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck	2289	B
and throw it out the at the and at uh	2289	B
so	2289	B
we're- we're now civilized now you can no longer you you cannot drink beer and drive but uh but it it was it was actually legal	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
yeah	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well you know the other	2289	B
<silence>	2289	B
well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit uh to uh just to conserve resources	2289	B
you know whether you know because_1 when you get in the habit of doing that you think in terms of of uh of of things like saving gas	2289	B
	2203	A
so what kind of garden do you have	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
oh	2203	A
um well that's nice- nice little garden	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
oh do you get get a good crop of plums	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
oh hadn't gotten any um yeah	2203	A
um yeah sounds nice i used to we we had some wild plum trees growing in a field when i was a near my house when i was a kid we used to go out there and raid it	2203	A
that's great love plums	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah it's same around here too makes you wonder what they're what they're sending out i mean yeah where is it	2203	A
because_1 certainly they're not using it for juices and stuff i mean they use the junk for that it makes me wonder gosh if they're using junk for that what are we getting here	2203	A
oh really	2203	A
yeah i i've gotten to where i won't even buy juices anymore because_1 i'm afraid of what's in there	2203	A
well i don't do very much gardening i- i would like to but i just don't have the time to do it or keep it up right i- i try to get into some flowers and stuff i just	2203	A
placed an order again for some bulbs and waiting for those to show up and	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
um-hum	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
um-hum	2203	A
um-hum	2203	A
well i started	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah i started some about uh about_1 a month ago and had them_1 in little planters all over the house and my cats got to them_1 and that was the end of them_1	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah these- these two cats it's hard to keep anything around	2203	A

	2203	A
no i uh i'll take my chances with it course now where i where i'm at now i don't have to worry about the lawn because_1 they got somebody that comes in and does it	2203	A
it is nice he matter of fact he was here today it was the first really warm weather we've had and he came out and cut the yard and trimmed the hedges and all that	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah i guess i- i guess we're really into spring now	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
i don't i like winter yeah i like- i like cold dreary weather	2203	A
yeah i it it's	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
hum-um no i gosh i got use to it when i lived in South Dakota	2203	A
it's just great up there	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
no this is another one of those winters that wasn't	2203	A
yeah it's i don't know i was expecting snow and all of that i maybe i should have moved over to the mountains instead of here but uh they didn't get a lot of snow in the mountains either	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah yeah that was a big problem was i was in South Dakota course we'd had plenty of snow but uh every once in a while they they get shorted on the snow and the water supply starts drying up	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
because_1 those i mean those those summers up there are brutal	2203	A
terrible you get those uh Chinook winds coming across the prairies and golly it's uh it's unbelievable the extremes in weather up there but i enjoy it gosh i	2203	A
i- i hadn't been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah i i've been thinking about it only problem is i- i would be very limited in any job opportunities out there	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah yeah the uh i mean there's still basically ranchers and farmers up there you know	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
 yeah i	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A

and all these beautiful gardens and parks and all that good stuff now it's all been wiped out it's a shame	2203	A
oh well such is life	2203	A

<silence>	2203	A
uh-huh you get a get a frost or something hail that's even better	2203	A
yeah my the only the only thing i ever accomplished i i mean i've had gardens for a long long time when i was a kid i started uh i had some squash and tomatoes and watermelons	2203	A
and i grew a thirty four and a half pound watermelon yeah absolutely tasteless had no taste whatsoever	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
uh-huh cantaloupe's difficult to grow and get taste out of them i mean they're they're easy enough they'll grow easy enough but you can't get any flavor	2203	A
<silence>	2203	A
yeah i i buy them every once in a while and and i bought one and it was you know blah	2203	A
and then i said well i'll try another one so this is several weeks later and i bought another one and it was just as sweet and wonderful but you never know	2203	A
uh-huh it's like oranges and everything else but anyway	2203	A
oh yeah they look terrible here i look at those thing i say i wouldn't buy them not even to squeeze for orange juice uh	2203	A
<silence>	2203	B

<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B

all of his own plants under a a light he put out in the garage to help keep them you know alive and get them a good start so we hope we have a lot of flowers this year so	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B

oh you ought to you ought to send a videotape that and send it into America's Home Videos yeah	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
that's right you you know that could be worth ten thousand dollars so	2203	B
that's right	2203	B
	2203	B
yeah	2203	B
that's right you can buy lots of cat food with that so or hire somebody to do your lawn so then you don't have to worry about it we have a big problem around here with insect problems you know fire ants and	2203	B
so that's it gets expensive around here to do a lawn because you're always you know buying the fertilizer and the you know the bug killers and weed killers yeah	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green it's	2203	B
	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh that's nice	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
yeah well we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out	2203	B
you know in their front yards doing their yard and	2203	B
it's a perfect day for it	2203	B
yeah i i love spring i just love it	2203	B

	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
yeah	2203	B
no talking to my folks in Wyoming they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they don't they're going to have water problems this summer so	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
that's right they need the the snow for the water so	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B

<silence>	2203	B
oh well it sounds like you need to move back there	2203	B

	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany	2203	B

<silence>	2203	B
oh wow	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
i had one of those too it was a weather phone call yeah	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh	2203	B
 oh well you really kind of have the same kind of weather	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
 i had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were out of their house because of the ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
yeah yeah they couldn't even be in the house because they had no power and everything	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
yeah and here we were i mean i talked to her we had just gotten over a ninety four degree day so we really had a lot to compare so	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh i she's talking to my husband i think so yeah so	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh yeah that's what she said they they were going to have- the governor was going to try to have it declared a disaster area	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh yeah it really is	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh that's what it is with us too you just like get so frustrated you get something about ready ripe and there goes the bugs and	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh or hail	2203	B
yeah it just you know	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh my word	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
oh was it	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
we grew cantaloupe last year and that's how they were just tasteless you couldn't even eat them	2203	B
yeah	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
yeah yeah you have to be so careful when you buy at the stores	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
<silence>	2203	B
uh-huh yeah nope you don't it's hard to pick them	2203	B
oh yeah the oranges here look disgusting so	2203	B
so	2203	B
uh-huh	2203	B
yeah they're all	2203	B
	2291	A
uh interestingly enough in my younger days i taught school for two years while my husband was getting his business established and i find the changes uh in the school system	2291	A
i think a lot of them very positive	2291	A
uh since his retirement the first of January in nineteen ninety i've gone back to subbing and of course subbing is a very different	2291	A
endeavor than teaching uh	2291	A
it's very difficult and i've after almost two years i've become a little bit disillusioned and i'm not real sure that	2291	A
i'm going to go back to it because uh	2291	A
of discipline uh although i've never had a problem with it i guess i've just gotten a little tired of fighting	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
i think uh the quality of education in the high school system here is better i think the teachers that we have now are more professional	2291	A
and i think the students are more education minded than they were twenty years ago	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
in the community itself that spill over so to speak	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
um-hum	2291	A
i find that the school uses the parents as an excuse and the parents use the school as an excuse however	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
we're in uh as i said a small town in Indiana and it's a WASP community with a student body of five hundred in the high school so the setting is very different than it would be in	2291	A
Dallas or Chicago or even Indianapolis which is a couple hours south of us	2291	A
uh but to me	2291	A
the	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
the more gifted or the higher intelligent children are more geared to learning than they were they're more into the school system than they were twenty years ago and uh i find the Say No to Drugs campaign here	2291	A
to be i think very effective unless i have my head in the sand	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh oh sure there are high schools as large as our community	2291	A
which makes a totally different situation	2291	A
i've i've never felt that pouring more tax dollars in was the answer to solving any school problems or most of the school problems	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh isn't that the way with most groups though they become a self-protection thing uh of saving jobs or getting more salary uh	2291	A
i do i do find that	2291	A
the majority- the majority of teachers in our group are very professional but then of course we're a stable community and many of them have been in the system for twenty years which i just can't think you'd find that in a large city school	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
except we don't have another school	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
because they have fewer students	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
you don't find that parents are getting more involved in your area	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
um-hum	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
um-hum	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
i think single parents probably contribute a lot of the problems in school systems because the system's really getting sixty percent of the student's day	2291	A
if if the mother or the father certainly would have to work and they're not getting home until probably five o'clock at the very earliest and the student's out at three	2291	A
i think really uh the school does have more of that student's time because eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent they're going to be sleeping and certainly the parent needs some social life besides uh	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
they might need to be dealt with yeah	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
uh-huh	2291	A
uh-huh And we did have we did recently have a a group here formed called Students for Academic Excellence	2291	A
that was formed by concerned parents and they see that these these kids are getting honor jackets and they're getting certificates and they're getting uh more access to scholarships uh on a par	2291	A
with the athletes which uh this was formed i think probably in the last three years and that's been a very positive thing for education itself because so often the emphasis is on	2291	A
uh baseball basketball and football and it gets away from what the school is established for originally	2291	A
uh	2291	A
 well this is basketball in Indiana so	2291	A
uh-huh We do all have our sport In fact we've been on a real high here because our basketball team won their regional for the first time in the history of the school So sport is uh	2291	A
has been really first and foremost here in the last month But we hope that education is first and foremost for the year	2291	A
nice talking to you	2291	A
uh-huh bye	2291	A
	2291	A
<silence>	2291	A
	2291	B
uh	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yes	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yeah what what do you said you think there're some improvements what do you think the improvements have been	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
i think the problems that i see in the system uh are i- i tend to see more in uh	2291	B
large inner city school districts	2291	B
that uh	2291	B
and i've i've noticed that uh suburban or rural schools tend to have much fewer problems at least what i from what i hear than than than the inside the city school districts	2291	B
and so i think the problem isn't so much the school system as in the things that go on around it	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yeah	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum well my my personal opinion is that so many parents especially those parents who are in a lower income and have to	2291	B
spend more of their energy on work	2291	B
they say okay well i- i don't have to teach my kids anything the school's going to do it for me and i think the school can't	2291	B
do that the school can only exist as something to help the parents out not something to take the parents' place	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um that that can be yeah	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
uh-huh	2291	B
yeah um	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
that you know kind of goes along it it it's a small enough school where people can know each other and and they can work together to thwart off problems when when you've got a high school with you know three or four thousand students	2291	B
um there's just no it's it's very difficult to keep track of them all	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yeah	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
	2291	B
yeah the i- i find that i- i haven't seen any cases where that's been very effective and that seems to be what people want to do is just you know put more money into it	2291	B
and i just don't have a whole lot of confidence in that	2291	B
i also you know i consider for example the the teachers the National Education Association you know they	2291	B
i would like to see them be more of a professional organization rather than a union	2291	B
because we need- you know we need to we need to uh instead of worrying about saving jobs or raising salaries i think we need to worry about uh how well the job's getting done	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yes	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yes	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my my personal feelings is that parents need to be taking more responsibility	2291	B
i think the way i like to look at it you know a lot of people look at well whose job is it to teach the kids well it's the school's job i think whose job is it to teach the kids well primarily it's the parents job	2291	B
because_1 the kids spend more time with the parents than they spend at school and the school is just there to help the parents	2291	B
so i think the the number one responsibility is on the heads of the parents and and we need to get to the idea well if the kids are	2291	B
are doing poorly in school then the parents need to take some sort of responsibility and and take some sort of action instead of	2291	B
just complaining about what the school is doing or not doing and sometimes	2291	B
if the parents don't like the way the school is being run the appropriate action is to have the choice to take that kid out of that school and put him in a different school	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yeah that's in in small communities that's a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yeah it's it's the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that the parents be able to have a choice saying i don't like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where they'll be properly uh	2291	B
properly taught and properly uh trained	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
some parents are but some parents don't have the opportunity to do that as easily you know people that are working two jobs or single parents uh that sort of thing	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yeah	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
and you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work you you just you you want to rest for a little while and and maybe the children uh don't want you to rest	2291	B
yeah	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
and it's it's a difficult problem and it's one that	2291	B
well- basically i think in in in large measure it's it's it's up to the parents to take the responsibility for what's happening	2291	B
to their childrens education i think	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
yes and here here in Texas if you don't like football you're considered a heretic	2291	B
yes that was going to be my guess	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
um-hum	2291	B
<silence>	2291	B
alright well thank you for the call	2291	B
bye	2291	B
	2291	B
<silence>	2290	A
so	2290	A
are you a freshwater or	2290	A
freshwater	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
um-hum	2290	A
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater	2290	A
huh	2290	A
mostly deep sea fishing for	2290	A
grouper and bottom fish	2290	A
and uh	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
huh i have caught	2290	A
one or two small sharks	2290	A
and uh yes	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
put them back	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
no no no i love shark steak	2290	A
but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
is there a limit i have no idea i know i my home is in uh Pensacola Florida so	2290	A
it's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf	2290	A
and um a certain period of time during the year they have	2290	A
all along the gulf coast from i guess from Galveston to Mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from	2290	A
the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not	2290	A
oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but	2290	A
nothing i think i've been trout fishing once uh	2290	A
i've never fly fished have you fly fished	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
well i've tried it once yes uh a friend of mine	2290	A
no	2290	A
i could never get the hang of it	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
uh-huh	2290	A
i usually ended snagging	2290	A
my	2290	A
uh fishing partners or	2290	A
the trees along the bank	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
 yes almost got an owl once but uh	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
oh no no no no i used uh when i was uh	2290	A
working in Florida i used to do a lot of um surf fishing	2290	A
mostly for relaxation	2290	A
you know there are	2290	A
there are people who fish and then there are people who catch	2290	A
well i'm a fisher	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
 that's right i i've never caught uh that much but uh	2290	A
oh and occasionally we'd go out on a you know uh	2290	A
full day trip you know three or four other people and do	2290	A
either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know i've caught a few	2290	A
worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth	2290	A
what about you you a	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
um-hum	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
oh yes	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
the last time i went uh	2290	A
bass fishing uh i was with my daughter	2290	A
a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter	2290	A
we	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
i was the only one	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
i did not even i did not even i have been	2290	A
i was out on a	2290	A
party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
everyone on the boat	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
was catching	2290	A
snapper	2290	A
snappers	2290	A
except	2290	A
guess who i could- i	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
that's right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh	2290	A
the uh the party boat captain could not understand	2290	A
you know he even even he started baiting my hook and holding holding the uh the fishing rod	2290	A
right and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher i'm not a catcher but uh	2290	A
i enjoy it though i don't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too and uh	2290	A
they do of course you know here in um we're only just a you know few not a few minutes we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland	2290	A
and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is uh	2290	A
go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh	2290	A
or oyster- for oysters	2290	A
and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and	2290	A
actually pick them off the bottom	2290	A
	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
um-hum	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
um-hum	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
hm	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
uh-huh	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
uh-huh	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
well we used to i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is uh in	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
some of the	2290	A
inlets and the rivers around Rehoboth Delaware	2290	A
they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it	2290	A
and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters	2290	A
um-hum	2290	A
and this is the ugliest	2290	A
fish i have ever seen and i mean- and they come in all size- you know i've i've caught them from you know three or four inches long	2290	A
up to uh i guess the largest- largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible	2290	A
no no	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
 they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
um-hum	2290	A
<silence>	2290	A
well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in	2290	A
and i threw my line out	2290	A
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or	2290	A
uh two feet long and scared me to death i i had never seen anything and then i was fished- fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth	2290	A
and then i	2290	A
felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one	2290	A
and i pulled	2290	A
<silence>	2290	B
okay	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
mostly freshwater uh yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in Galveston with my parents and	2290	B
i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to to do anything and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now so i don't fish too much in saltwater	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
oh really	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
oh neat	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
oh really	2290	B
what'd you do with them	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
 you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a a sport fish can you actually catch those and there's no limit	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
uh-huh	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
oh really	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
uh-huh	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
uh no i haven't i don't know that i could do that that looks awful tiring	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
did you	2290	B
didn't like it	2290	B
	2290	B
it looks complicated to me it's a rhythm or something	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2290	B
 catching tree bass right did you that would have been something	2290	B
so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
uh-huh	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
 you just like to sit down and watch it right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
really	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
that's nice	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and	2290	B
um most of it i haven't been really in a long time last time i went i actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun um but	2290	B
um i went fishing at i don't know if you've ever heard of uh Lake Worth it's a fairly new lake in Texas	2290	B
and uh we went fishing there last Memorial Day and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and um	2290	B
that's really about it mostly just the lakes around here and i i fish to take home and cook i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching	2290	B
i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i wanna i want to say i brought something home i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2290	B
 really	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2290	B
	2290	B
everybody but you	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
 it had to be you you couldn't catch one to save your life right	2290	B
	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2290	B
	2290	B
	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them_1	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
yeah	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
oh yeah	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
that would be fun	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
right hand picked	2290	B
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh Rockport which is close to Corpus	2290	B
and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area	2290	B
and uh we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab	2290	B
so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything	2290	B
and something i had a rock to weight it down	2290	B
something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm i'm sure it's not a fish right	2290	B
and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life It had real teeth like human teeth	2290	B
and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth	2290	B
it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does	2290	B
it it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
um-hum	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
i've never heard of that one	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
that's where it gets its name obviously huh	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
um-hum	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
huh	2290	B
can you eat them	2290	B
ooh i i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
oh that's like this dogfish it was it scared me to death	2290	B
it was ugly- it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
oh	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2290	B
<silence>	2290	B
	2204	A
okay i guess we're on the air now	2204	A
uh i haven't had too much experience with uh judges and jurors	2204	A
i've uh served on a jury one time and uh i think one of my concerns after that experience was	2204	A
uh finding that there tend to be people in the jury that can't bring themselves to sentence someone	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
um	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
yeah i'm inclined to agree you do need a uh fixed and clear sentence there	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
yeah	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
yes	2204	A
um-hum	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
yeah i think that was a logical decision there	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
um-hum	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
well- well yeah i think they went back for a brief hearing on the sentence	2204	A
uh but that was that was fairly quick i think that is something that we need in this country i know the last time i was down in the Caribbean	2204	A
uh we had visited the island of uh Saint Thomas which is American	2204	A
and there were twenty three unsolved murders and nobody seem to be concerned about it	2204	A
at the same time there was one unsolved murder on the island of Tortola and the whole island wanted to know when the hanging was going to take place	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
i've never uh really been sure that a juror is entitled to ask a question	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
um-hum	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
yes	2204	A
i don't know whether they can go back and call witnesses for that though it's it depends on the the transcript- they can ask uh points of order of law	2204	A
and maybe they can ask for a review of the transcript	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
uh but uh asking questions during the trial my experience as a juror uh well it was a traffic situation uh there were three points of law that had to be made	2204	A
and the County Attorney did not make the points	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
but the uh defendant took the stand on his own behalf	2204	A
	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
um-hum	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
um	2204	A
i work for E Systems	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
okay	2204	A
	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
okay	2204	A
	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
oh i know Hal Ammon quite well	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
okay	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
well say hi to Al or Hal the next time you see him	2204	A
and tell	2204	A
yeah well tell him that Bill Mayhood sell hi- said hi	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
okay	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
all right	2204	A
<silence>	2204	A
thank you good night	2204	A
	2204	A
	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
right	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
yes i- i have my primary experience has been as uh an expert witness and- and uh and two murder trials	2204	B
and uh in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be uh death	2204	B
but in terms of i well the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for uh certain crimes	2204	B
i think	2204	B
depending on uh in certain crimes i think that they should be mandatory	2204	B
for example uh armed robbery	2204	B
uh if we have convicted i think uh plea bargaining should should be uh a thing of the past	2204	B
um	2204	B
certain types of uh	2204	B
you know homicides	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
yes in in homicides related to other than i guess what are called uh crimes of passion uh for example you know as you as you very well know	2204	B
the great majority of homicides are	2204	B
people murdering other people they know mostly people they know	2204	B
so in those instances uh that's uh i think that there is some leeway there what was- is interesting in this regard is the recent case in New Hampshire	2204	B
uh the schoolteacher	2204	B
and the life sentence uh she received	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
 yes	2204	B
and it came very quickly surprisingly	2204	B
uh i guess it was uh they brought in their verdict and sentence at the same time did they not	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
um-hum	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
um	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
	2204	B
well in answer to you know answer to the question though i still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury even though as you say there are some	2204	B
uh people who are reluctant i do not think again in the matter of uh uh that that judges should have the	2204	B
uh	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
the upper hand or the only hand in that sense because i think if but i i've never served on a jury you probably know this better than i um	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
if the jury does their job and of course there are those on the jury that do not i'm sure but and ask the questions and	2204	B
uh correctly and then one of things i've always wondered is uh the ability of jurors to to ask questions	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
well that that that and that's an interesting point i've never i you know i've thought about it i've asked myself you know this question before	2204	B
i've never taken the time to do the research to answer my own question but i know that at least during the deliberations of the jury	2204	B
they can ask questions	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
um-hum	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
right	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
um-hum	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
um-hum may i ask you a question	2204	B
why does your voice sound familiar to me	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
that's that's	2204	B
probably why it does i work for GTE	2204	B
	2204	B
your your voice you know when uh i didn't recognize the name but the more i listen to your voice i	2204	B
uh i know i have heard it somewhere	2204	B
and i was trying to place where i had heard it that's very interesting but now back to the topic	2204	B
	2204	B
but uh because i work for	2204	B
uh Hal Ammon	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
yes i am on staff to Hal Ammon to GTE	2204	B
	2204	B
so	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
i	2204	B
i will and which will probably be the uh Monday as a matter of fact	2204	B
<silence>	2204	B
okay Bill i recognize the name now i and uh my name is Jim Moscow	2204	B
and uh so i've heard the name	2204	B
	2204	B
but uh all right well thank you for calling and nice and have a good weekend	2204	B
good-bye	2204	B
	2204	B
	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
right yeah well when uh we lived in San Antonio i grew up around San Antonio and it's always been a very large uh city and increasingly growing	2285	B
it's has kind of the split population um there's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there and then there's a very large Hispanic population there	2285	B
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic uh gang crime in the city and that is uh been the worse thing that we've seen happening uh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
um the majority of the actual gang crimes like the the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods but the crime spreads out into the more affluent uh divisions through robberies rape	2285	B
and uh car crime there's a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft	2285	B
and San Antonio- San Antonio's not far from the border to Mexico so a a lot of the uh cars go to uh you know hack shops and they take them_1 apart and a lot of them_1 go over the border especially like Mercedes	2285	B
a lot of those those in the the Z uh the Z cars the Datsun cars end up over the border and uh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
very much so very much so in fact um for a while there uh they had	2285	B
downtown if you were to come- come to a stop light they had a a rash of where people were uh when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up	2285	B
so now uh ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and uh once you've reached the	2285	B
the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during the- during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and um	2285	B
you know or or alone if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the- the river patrol cops it's very nice	2285	B
but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track um	2285	B
there's a lot of parking garages there because um parking is very tight and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage um alone	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
it's just so sad you know it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more um in San Antonio i don't know what the answer is uh	2285	B
education i think is a lot of it um so many of the kids are are drop outs um uh	2285	B
they have- there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels i think education helps a little bit there um	2285	B
they again i don't know really what steps there are that they	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B

uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh yeah i don't know how you combat that i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids um	2285	B
so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
oh yeah	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
and i don't know how you combat that i really- i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know i- i don't-	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
yeah	2285	B
and what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then i i feel i feel for them i don't know how to make it better for them or	2285	B
you know unless because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable i'm leaving the big city mom and i'm i'm going off you know when they're ten they have to live in it and	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
right i think so and uh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh yeah	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
yeah	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh no in San Antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh oh yeah but	2285	B
um-hum	2285	B
but there's a lot of them it's very prevalent a lot of the the crime is very prevalent	2285	B
uh-huh very much When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above Carmel and um there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed	2285	B
around here and um those that aren't there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there	2285	B
um migrant Hispanic farm workers uh people that are down and out and uh they all seem to congregate in Celinas not so much here in Monterrey	2285	B
so it's it's pretty quiet i've been- you know we walk the streets at night and uh people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
right	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
yeah	2285	B
<silence>	2285	B
uh-huh oh	2285	B
well i didn't know that about Burlington i'll have to keep that in mind	2285	B
	2285	A
okay well like i was saying Burlington's crime it doesn't involve children and what you see on the TV's from you know in Washington and New York	2285	A
so what i believe the people want the subject is is big city crime which is something	2285	A
that i don't have any first hand experiences about but i have you know concerns and i have a few ideas of um	2285	A
how to combat it i mean i don't i don't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything so that's one thing that	2285	A
that's one thing that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money so	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
oh	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people's community or does it stay in the bad neighborhood	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
so that's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
oh my it sounds like um San Juan Puerto Rico we were there	2285	A
just well for a lay over and um well it wasn't a lay over we were some we had	2285	A
we were staying at the other end the island we drove into San Juan to catch our plane it was at night and this boy really wanted to go on the beach and they look at you crazy you don't go on the beach I says well it's a big tourist town	2285	A
you know don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night and they said no it's very safe in the daytime but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk	2285	A
and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young and what we have here in Burlington which	2285	A
it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids	2285	A
council that they have all these after school activities for kids they set up	2285	A
kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings	2285	A
and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer and they have gyms open	2285	A
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs	2285	A
after school you might keep them but you again you need that one on one	2285	A
like a big brother trying to keep the the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school it'll get better you know so that your mom doesn't have a job and	2285	A
and she doesn't work- you don't know you can be better than that you don't have to live on the you know the for a street life	2285	A
but	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
yeah but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here i mean um they can deal with that scale	2285	A
they might have five hundred troubled youths when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into the- well the kids now they're so it's twelve years old and they're	2285	A
selling drugs and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun	2285	A
it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but	2285	A
if i had a child that that that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy	2285	A
and we don't have it so we deserve it and we should take it	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
yeah	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old The parents might be thirty years old	2285	A
and i'm thirty years old and i'm kind of irresponsible but i have the morals that keep me from	2285	A
you know if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldn't do it in front of my child these people you know they bring their their Johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room	2285	A
it's just- just that they have absolutely no no morals and it's really sad	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
but i like your idea of education if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
yeah it's really sad like if they did have a big brother big sister program those those people trying to help the kids the parents might have hostilities towards them	2285	A
you know like you're judging us and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true	2285	A
it it it's i'm glad i don't live in a big city	2285	A
just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe it's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i don't see and i might see it on a you know a a Sixty Minute special	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
i know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
but any big city has a bad section	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
yes they're very bold it seems	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
really even uh even in the worst crime areas in Burlington i i can walk the streets i wouldn't i if i did it every night	2285	A
i think there would be trouble in our house so you wouldn't get confronted or anything	2285	A
but i don't think you would uh	2285	A
someone might grab you mess around with you but they're not going to grab you steal your- your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities	2285	A
	2285	A
<silence>	2285	A
	2282	B
 you know	2282	B
you- you're talking to probably one of the- the sixties- the late sixties and early seventies original hippies now living in suburbia raising kids um	2282	B
 i don't know i have a i have a real gut response that says nobody's got a you know a right to take anybody else's life on the other hand i have seen an awful lot of i've lived in major cities and i have kind of come to the conclusion that there are certain people that should just be shot	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
yes	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
yeah	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
something like twenty two or twenty three i remember reading that and being horrified	2282	B
uh had she had any previous criminal history now that's the of thing i'd have to kind of look at	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
in Texas if you're going to sentence somebody to uh to death what is is there a specific criteria that they have to meet	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
um if you were on a jury would would you be able to to give somebody a death sentence	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
um-hum	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
how about if it was uh a seventeen and a half year old with a a list and all uh of what do they call it uh criminal	2282	B
as long as your armed over the history of a violent crime	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
yeah	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
yeah see i come from a Catholic church background too	2282	B
and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than uh shoplifting	2282	B
and it was very easy to maintain this stand that you know that that life is something that you have no right to- to take	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
i don't know you	2282	B
there was a oh what was his Gary Gilmore	2282	B
did you ever read the book that Norman Mailer wrote The Executioners Song	2282	B
Gary Gilmore was the one who was arrested and uh found guilty of i think two or three murders in Utah Provo- outside of Provo and he was the one that was petitioning to have have you know himself executed	2282	B
when you read his book with all the interviews this guy did with Gary Gilmore you know it sounds like the guy had about every turn	2282	B
given to him every rehab opportunity given to him and even interviews with his mother she said that you know for- for- as a small child he's basically was amoral	2282	B
and when i finished that book i kind of thought you know what do you how do with a person like this	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
see i would i always come look at it do they have could they be put you know even in life imprisonment could they be put to useful labor	2282	B
could they do road work and those kind of things and now then you get somebody like Charles Manson who just even hasn't a guy around	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
and then what do you do about the the thing that you know the the the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
have you ever sat on a jury	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
either have i and i'm one of these people who votes regularly and i'm always registered wherever i've lived and i have never been called	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
part of me says that i'd kind of like to do it just to see what it's like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
yeah have you ever lived in a in a well but Dallas is i'm is are you calling from Dallas	2282	B
okay have you have you ever been a victim of a crime	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
you know when we lived in Boston i had eleven cars stolen	2282	B
yeah some of them i had for two days and you'd go to court and you'd see these kids and then and-	2282	B
what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you uh would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial and it'd be the same damn kids	2282	B
over and over and over again and the first couple of times you know i felt really sorry for them_1 but after a while it was like you know shoot the little shits right then and there and then i felt really you know guilty about feeling that way	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
yeah yeah i you know i really don't know what- what i would do in that situation if i had to to make that judgment i think i would i think i'd be very easily swayed by fellow jurors	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
boy if they ever catch this guy in in Richardson and Coppell who's been uh you know abducting the the young girls i don't think i'd even hesitate	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
and then you get- you know what do you do with you know people that are you know chronic child molesters	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
where even a psychiatrist says	2282	B
you're probably not going to change them they're always going to be you know at risk in society and and and i think you know having kids has probably really	2282	B
changed you know my thinking on this i don't know i really don't know	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
yeah but the code of ethics that's learned in prison is so- so bent and twisted that you wonder when they get out of there even if they you know claim that they're are rehabbed	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
they don't even have social skills	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
oh i don't know i really don't know i- i think that if somebody asked me i would hesitantly say yes that i could- could hand down a death sentence	2282	B
uh then the big you know my big problem would be is what if you were in a in a state that absolutely did not allow it	2282	B
and you were on a jury with some heinous you know criminal who had you know just wiped out an entire family	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
or parole in in uh fifteen twenty years	2282	B
<silence>	2282	B
	2282	A
do you believe in uh capital punishment	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
uh-huh	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
yeah	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
yeah well i think uh that based on um certain crimes it uh is merited uh there was a case just recently i don't know if you uh if you heard about this in uh New Hampshire i believe	2282	A
about the uh teacher school teacher who hired her uh one of her high school students to kill her husband and they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole	2282	A
and in a case like that uh where well you've got a moral problem and an economic one uh	2282	A
when when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole ah what good does it do anybody and the taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for the rest of her life she's a young young woman uh in her late twenties i guess	2282	A
so i just	2282	A
early twenties- well i could be yeah	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
um i don't know i didn't hear that much about it uh just the uh the verdict that they had	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
um i don't- i don't really know about that uh uh	2282	A
if well uh i think- i think it's it's only uh it only applies to certain- a very few types of crimes uh murder and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well	2282	A
i'm not sure what how- what the range is for uh for the crimes that uh would merit a death penalty	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
uh i think it depends on what what it was they did and if the evidence was uh uh if there was no doubt in my mind that that person was guilty of that crime	2282	A
and if they were uh if if if i had no doubt that uh they would be a a hazard to to the rest of uh the population as long as they were alive uh yeah i could probably go along with that	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
well i guess you've got a choice either you do life in prison or you can institutionalize somebody forever uh where they're not a threat to	2282	A
to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them_1 out of everybody's misery uh i don't know it's it's a real moral dilemma	2282	A
i mean i come from the Catholic church and they they uh are definitely opposed	2282	A
to that type of	2282	A
um-hum	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
right yeah	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
when you see all the people who are convicted of these crimes and they get out of prison after a few years	2282	A
all of the sudden here they're they're uh committing the same type of crimes all over again other people are victimized what do you do about it	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
no i never did	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
uh-huh	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
okay	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
right	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
well some people just are incorrigible and there's no way that they can ever deal with society and abide by rules	2282	A
so in in a case like that uh given what crime they're guilty of uh yeah i could uh i could justify a death penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to grips with uh living in normal society	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
um yeah i believe so	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
well people who tend to be say on death row they- i think they're kept in isolation all the time	2282	A
i don't believe that they're given a chance to uh do anything productive or even uh mix with the rest of the prison community	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
right well it's it's it's real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence if there's no doubt no i never have	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
i know several people at work who've been called on juries and they absolutely hate it	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
well so much of it is game playing with the lawyers they're plea- doing their plea bargaining and and uh give and take type situation that uh they're playing with people's lives in effect uh by offering uh to uh	2282	A
uh offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to get uh a lighter uh sentence- sentence	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
uh yeah i'm in that area uh-huh	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
uh yes i have uh automobile uh vandalism	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
my gosh	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
yeah	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
right	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
sure	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
yeah yeah i'd	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
i don't have much sympathy for people that are uh	2282	A
uh victimizing others on a regular basis you know if it's a one time offense and and the kid learns his lesson and uh shows remorse and promises never to do something again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter	2282	A
uh it's it's one thing but when they're there over and over again and uh guilty of the same crimes uh nothing seems to help	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
uh yeah well i think it depends on what the crime is uh you're not going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car uh if it's first degree murder or uh	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
right no something like that is just uh unforgivable	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
yeah well i don't know	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
right	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
yeah	2282	A
i think people like that when they do get put in prison with the other hard core prisoners uh the child molesters in particular are not looked on kindly by the other prisoners they don't get a lot of respect and they they probably tend not to even survive in that uh type of environment	2282	A
because_1 even in prison they have their code of ethics i guess if you can call it that	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
sure	2282	A
well-	2282	A
yeah they don't have any really useful job skills uh lots of places no	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
um-hum	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
well	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
right you've got life without parole something like that	2282	A
<silence>	2282	A
sure well case like Charles Manson he's uh he's been eligible for parole a couple of times already his case comes up every few years now i guess	2282	A
and uh people have to uh stand up and uh denounce him again and claim that he's not fit for society but we're that close to letting people like that out of prison	2282	A
<silence>	2250	B
health care	2250	B
number one	2250	B
dental and medical yes	2250	B
yes i'm fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year	2250	B
and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance	2250	B
and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance	2250	B
so i was really fortunate i really was	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
i think they will as long as they can but the problem	2250	B
obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year	2250	B
uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up	2250	B
and i'm concerned that's just you know the beginning of it	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
oh yeah	2250	B
that's a problem too yeah	2250	B
um-hum right	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum right	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
oh i	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it's it's good it's certainly better than nothing it's not you know it's not super you	2250	B
for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably don't have it you know i do have some dental problems and it's very very expensive	2250	B
and if your blessed with you know good dental	2250	B
uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are i've had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up	2250	B
you know we didn't know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then	2250	B
so the younger people you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than people of my generation or for the most part	2250	B
but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
oh gosh that's that's the general you know you- you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately	2250	B
i have two children and they're both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don't i don't have medical you know expenses for them per say	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage	2250	B
now we	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
that's right that's right and also we i say we uh i'm retired from Texas Instruments and they're just they're like most everybody else- you can't just	2250	B
you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go	2250	B
but there's only approved uh health care centers you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount	2250	B
if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn't make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go	2250	B
also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions	2250	B
to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective	2250	B
right so they have dropped the uh second opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there's a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it	2250	B
and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
absolutely you need about even probably	2250	B
absolutely do you have a family	2250	B
i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do	2250	B
but i would really check that out because_1 i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum right	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
that's right	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
um-hum	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
right	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
yeah absolutely absolutely	2250	B
um you know some companies can't- can't even afford any longer you know to carry the insurance they're just dropping it you know they don't have any choice it's bankrupting them	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
but i'm i am and very fortunate in that i was able to retire you know with with health benefits	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
oh absolutely absolutely	2250	B
same to you	2250	B
okay you take care of yourself good luck to you thank you bye-bye	2250	B
<silence>	2250	B
	2250	A
so what kind of benefits do- do you have in your job that you think is uh very important	2250	A
health care like dental	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
uh-huh	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
right	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
so just this so you think that the uh a good company will provide good health	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
right	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
i hear that's like one of the major uh the major costs to companies- to corporations nowadays	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
um-hum	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
right	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
see the problem i have with it is that i don't have a job	2250	A
so i don't have and i'm still in in school i'm still in college	2250	A
and so i don't i don't know firsthand of these benefits	2250	A
but i- i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean	2250	A
dental is is kind of like uh you know you're asking for uh too much	2250	A
to for me i think it's like uh	2250	A
you know uh you're you're expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and they'll pay you for it but	2250	A
to actually have you know big coverage for something like that	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
right i'm only twenty one	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
um-hum	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
right	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
 exactly yeah	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
um-hum	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
as health	2250	A
right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many- how many times you're going to use it	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
right	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
right so	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
uh-huh	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
too expensive more expensive for them to do that then	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
um-hum so that- that's pretty good	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
the very first thing i- i should look at huh	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
no not yet	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
um-hum	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger	2250	A
and that's scary because you know in the end you're getting insurance for basically nothing	2250	A
i mean something really really really serious has happened for you you know to to make it worthwhile and then that that that that that defeats the purpose of insurance	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
yeah	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
yeah	2250	A
that sounds like a big big asset to do that	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
well it's been nice talking to you	2250	A
i guess i'll uh maybe see you again sometime	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
you too bye	2250	A
<silence>	2250	A
<silence>	2242	B
i see	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
sure	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
uh-huh	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
well for me camping i've never owned a trailer so for me camping is more- more- more- has a lot more to do with backpacks and tents	2242	B
but i guess that this camping- two kinds of camping that um i've done one is to throw a a tent and food- food and the like in the back of a car and drive to a campsite and setup the tent and have the the car right next to me	2242	B
the other is to actually you know carry everything on your back i've done camping out in at in the Aspen Mountains in Colorado where	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
right right	2242	B
exactly	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
i understand	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
oh yeah oh	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
right	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
well either way it's get i guess maybe we can define it as living away from the home	2242	B
but	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
exactly	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
um-hum	2242	B
yeah when when i mentioned i've done this camping out of the car i've actually done of the situation just like that but what's interesting is it's through Texas Instruments	2242	B
yeah TI has a little- uh owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that borders that the lake is on the border of Texas and Oklahoma it's called Lake Texoma	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
yeah that's right so that's where i've done most of that actually	2242	B
it is it's really beautiful the the lake is is outstanding it's a huge huge huge lake	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
oh yeah	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
oh yeah i think you-	2242	B
well if you every get to Dallas you can probably you know borrow- you can go up there and get a space for the night for two bucks	2242	B
yeah so it's easy to do i'm actually interested in getting one of those kind of my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of years one of those kind of campers that pop-up	2242	B
so it's about uh maybe eight foot square and but only about two feet tall and when you get to where you're going it raises up and there's tenting material	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
yes exactly	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
exactly- exactly my wife has a lot of interest in those and i've actually been keeping my eye on the paper and they seem to be running between one and two thousand dollars which	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
sure	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
yeah	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
uh	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
um-hum	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
oh yeah yeah that	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B
i see	2242	B
<silence>	2242	B

<silence>	2242	B
	2242	B
	2242	A
okay camping my camping experiences are	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
uh using a trailer a Terry eighteen foot uh mobile trailer and and that's you know like going to lakes and stuff like that	2242	A
setting up the trailer for a weekend or a week or ten days or whatever uh what's what's your thoughts on camping	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
uh-huh	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
um-hum	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
yeah that's up here in New England that's we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you're you've got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh	2242	A
uh uh yeah that well	2242	A
	2242	A
of course camping again is is- is like you say that that your your backpacking is i guess what i would call true camping i'm not	2242	A
i'm not sure that the other camping- type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
that's right that's right we have we have uh around the lakes and ponds up here and stuff we have uh campsites that are uh barriers set aside for each like the each individual trailer and you have a sewer hookup and water and electricity	2242	A
and you back in you know and or just pull into your spot and	2242	A
uh some you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or by the week or whatever	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
oh really	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
	2242	A
yeah they what- Lake Texoma they've got a big uh big rec centers up there right	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
	2242	A
is that a pretty nice place	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
yeah	2242	A
i spent about ten years in Abilene for TI i i worked out there in Abilene in west Texas and i never did get a chance to get over to Lake Texoma i i wished i had uh	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
that's unreal yeah	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
oh yeah that folds out from it it's like a crank up top thing you yeah it's you're talking of a trailer type that you pull huh yeah okay	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
yeah yeah you can that's about the price of them_1 up here they're they're uh uh Sears sells them_1 Coleman sells them_1	2242	A
they have some some good buys on them_1 and those are pretty nice i they're they're have a little galley a little uh sink that's got some compressed air and water in it and uh and a little stove that's like a propane stove	2242	A
couple of little cabinets and and uh sleeping on either end of the the canvas when you open it up it's just all screened in so it's pretty neat uh	2242	A
the nice thing about dragging that is that it's very very convenient to travel on the highway with because it's very low	2242	A
	2242	A
	2242	A
yeah T E R R Y Terry	2242	A
well they're i guess	2242	A
they're pretty popular up this way yeah it's a pretty rugged trailer it's a tandem wheel even though it's only eighteen foot long so there's it drags pretty good you know with a car but	2242	A
i've got a big Oldsmobile that i pull it with when i	2242	A
uh if i get rid of that i'll have to get rid of the trailer because_1 i don't i'm not sure what else will be able to lug it around the hills up here	2242	A
kind of hilly country up through this way but	2242	A
um	2242	A
well uh i i like camping i i did a lot of it i when my kids were small of course they're all grown now and gone i've got four boys and they've kind of all gone and	2242	A
we don't really do that together much anymore as they've out two are out in California and two are still in Texas so we kind of don't get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little fishing but	2242	A
i wished i had the opportunity to do camping because_1 i used to love to live at the lake all summer and into the fall and	2242	A
uh it was kind of pretty nice but uh i just wish that i had an opportunity to do a little more	2242	A
the thing that i i then again i i tried pulling the trailer one year and i went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff but that got to be a hassle you know breaking down and setting up and breaking down so i decided that	2242	A
i would lease a spot- a spot on this particular lake here in northern New England and go there every every spring and stay there all summer and it really worked out good for me	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
oh yeah yeah	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
yeah	2242	A
no i drive from the campground	2242	A
which uh it adds maybe twenty miles uh you know uh each way but it's not all that much uh	2242	A
twenty miles- is going- is just going a little different way it's probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work i live in Rhode Island work in Massachusetts but	2242	A
it's uh it just adds about twenty miles to it but it's worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so	2242	A
and that's that's pretty nice because_1 you can fish and just	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
yeah well like i say it just uh	2242	A
i i enjoy doing it i wished i had more time to do it but hopefully i can get up a retirement here before too much longer and then	2242	A
i'll be looking forward to to like i say with a Winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do	2242	A
	2242	A
but uh it's been nice uh like i really appreciate talking with you and i thought i'd uh give you a call on my lunch time here today and worked out good	2242	A
yeah-	2242	A
<silence>	2242	A
uh i thank you very much you're ever up this way look me up here at TI in Attleboro	2242	A
thanks sir	2242	A
	2242	A
	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
exactly	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
smaller classrooms possibly	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
exactly	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
i would when i was in school um i was supposedly in one of the best school systems in the country in Fairfax county	2223	B
and i'm i think back and i i don't feel like i i could have learned a lot more and don't feel like i learned as much	2223	B
i've only been out of school high school for four years but i think i could have learned a lot more and i've i worry about the children that are in	2223	B
the other school systems that aren't as good um i don't know any particular ones but you know when when they say one of the where i went to school was one of the best counties then i think	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
i know um i know with um i think teachers need to be paid more i have a lot of friends who and myself who've thought about	2223	B
going into elementary education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got and said well there's a lot of other things I can do and get a lot more money	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
exactly	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
and and i mean their their day doesn't end you know when schools out	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
i mean they they uh go home and grade papers lesson plans prepare for the next day	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
i'm an interior design major	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
yep so	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
exactly in May	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
yeah	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
uh-huh	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
i think that's about it you too	2223	B
<silence>	2223	B
{alrighty} you too thank you bye bye	2223	B
	2223	A
okay the topic that we have Victoria again as I mentioned was	2223	A
what do you feel is wrong with our public school system and i guess	2223	A
if i were to look at with four grown children and having been through- all four of them through public schools and colleges	2223	A
i guess the public school system i would have to say is that	2223	A
we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more	2223	A
we need to we need to probably	2223	A
try to get more one on one with the teachers and the and the students if we could	2223	A
and the other thing was we need to really really to tighten up our discipline in schools because they run here in New England i'm not sure about the rest of the country but i know the schools are almost running rampant up here	2223	A
and it's too bad because there are you know serious drinking problems with with real	2223	A
um you know young young kids i'm talking kids that are nine ten eleven twelve years old	2223	A
drug problems	2223	A
 go ahead i'm sorry	2223	A
<silence>	2223	A
uh-huh	2223	A
<silence>	2223	A
yeah i lived i lived that's just outside of Washington i lived in Fairfax county that was really really a nice nice area down there and	2223	A
my i had the same situation here my kids were we bought them_1 up and put them in the public schools here in Rhode Island and	2223	A
they were not not too too bad and this was going back like ten years i guess	2223	A
ten years ago they were not too too bad at that time	2223	A
and i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move from Rhode Island to Texas with with TI with my job	2223	A
and i worked there in the southwest for ten almost ten or eleven years and the kids got a my kids got a much better education- education in Texas simply because they had the opportunity to have more one on one	2223	A
uh relationships with the with the uh the facility okay and and that helped like especially one of my sons he was he could learn but he really had to work at learning if if that makes sense to you	2223	A
and and uh again like you say there was and you are still a student and there's so much more you could have learned and	2223	A
but i i i don't know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we've lost	2223	A
well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we've kind of lost that in out school system and i'm not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it	2223	A
<silence>	2223	A
oh yeah it's so it it's so hard and and it's so hard to compete and and that's not one of the things that's gonna make the people like yourself who are just graduating from colleges you know or out across the country	2223	A
wanna go jumping into a an education field when the when there's you can almost double your pay in almost any other field you know for as a as a entry level	2223	A
and i am not saying that we should give them the world either but I think we should pay them a little more money	2223	A
um they say a hundred and eighty days a year is all they work and i don't really believe that i think it's a lot more than that	2223	A
when you figure the hours and time they put into the school and stuff alright and even if is only a hundred and eighty days a year lets pay them for the hundred and eighty days a year i mean	2223	A
<silence>	2223	A
no no they that's what i mean at one time we we used to able to carry that over to the kids of course i	2223	A
i can see the teacher's point too where at at three o'clock or four o'clock they want to go home and not worry about kids so but if they had probably some renumeration to help them say you know maybe i'll give this kid a little extra help or something	2223	A
in the long run i think it would really be worth while	2223	A
<silence>	2223	A
what what is your major in school that your ah super that sounds good and you're finishing up this year huh	2223	A
well that's great i i wish you all the best in in your future in your endeavors out there in what ever you are doing and it's good to talk to a a a student rather than	2223	A
most of the folk i've talked to are are industrial people that- like my self that have been in the work work force for a number of years and and it's ah it's refreshing to talk to ah to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and thing you know and see how you feel about things	2223	A
well i don't know what else we can do about this school situation Victoria and if there's anything else you'd like to add	2223	A
you have a nice day and i'm going to say good bye for now and if you're ever up Rhode Island way around TI look me up it's Ray Smith at TI in Albrough Massachusetts	2223	A
have a nice one Victoria and good luck in your future bye bye	2223	A
	2223	A
	2233	B
so what do you think of uh public schools today	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
uh	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
so they can't decide	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
um	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
oh	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
and and and the restriction is it sort of	2233	B
sort of screwing- screwing around with whoever is getting what money to what school	2233	B
yeah we actually don't have we have we're having some problems of our own up here with teachers	2233	B
but um we are we are apparently i'm i'm fairly new to Rochester i've only been here a couple- a few years	2233	B
and we are supposedly Rochester public schools are are one of the model	2233	B
the city schools are some of the models for the rest of the country	2233	B
they have very specific programs that um	2233	B
that are being implemented at the moment that everybody is watching	2233	B
you know to make sure that they're all they're all working and uh	2233	B
for instance they have a mentor teacher program where um	2233	B
there are teachers who take a year off or so and gets to go around and and help other teachers learn how to teach	2233	B
and things like that but they're having a lot of problems here because um	2233	B
because they also pay the teachers i think much better than others places in the country	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
they they pay them well	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
oh yeah they there they pay them a little better here i think than most than than than than the national average especially these mentor teachers	2233	B
but they're having a large problem negotiating contracts they have been in contract- they have been without a contract i believe for over six months	2233	B
or something like six months	2233	B
and they are now putting in you know some sort of federal arbitrator i think or something because they just have a horrible time getting the	2233	B
you know getting their contracts straightened out	2233	B
they have been good and they only walked out once or twice i believe they keep getting you know they they- they'll go all the way to your table they'll have some proposal and then	2233	B
someone won't like it for some reason or some of them will say vote it down and it just goes	2233	B
but	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
yeah so that that's	2233	B
that that's always i'm i'm actually i'm a PhD student at the moment	2233	B
and um it's always occurred to me that that um	2233	B
you know i mean so looking at it so- all so i have some bias in this	2233	B
but it but it's always seemed to me that that that those people who	2233	B
should be paid the most i think or paid significantly- you know significantly more are are teacher types because they sort of hold more of the future in our hands than almost anyone else yet	2233	B
yet i don't think that uh it it it's being done	2233	B
i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think we're lacking in some very specific areas	2233	B
that that need to be worked on i will	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
yeah	2233	B
how what- do what do you mean by that	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
oh yeah	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
um-hum	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
that's true that's true	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
but well i think that	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
yeah i think actually in any there are some places where some teachers are just afraid to teach you know are they going to	2233	B
or they go to work where they're just baby sitters i think rather than teachers you know they're job is to make sure that	2233	B
no kids get killed in their classroom for that day and	2233	B
nobody else get's out so it's hard to imagine a	2233	B
you know i mean i- i- i can't imagine teaching in a situation like that and actually trying to get anything across to a student	2233	B
i'd be more concerned about getting myself out alive at the end of the day and just being happy	2233	B
so i- i sit back that the that's one of the main things that sort of happens to be sure up you know in or educational system maybe	2233	B
 do that means you have to have a	2233	B
metal detector and and uh outside the school or something	2233	B
i'm not sure	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
well possibly i think it does um	2233	B
i'm not sure i think it does some uh	2233	B
it it it it may sort of lead to some	2233	B
uh it it it may just be another form of sort of regimenting you know in kids which i which i think is good actually to have some kids sort of sit together and	2233	B
you know just say things and sort of do things together so possibly	2233	B
possibly i think that um	2233	B
uh i'm i'm i'm actually Jewish so i suspect that i would be more in favor of sort of nonsectarian sort of prayer	2233	B
in school but i think some things might be a a wise idea just to give kids more of an authoritarian sort of view	2233	B
i think a lot of kids are having a problem with that today	2233	B
i would- would i would agree with you and uh	2233	B
i think somewhat	2233	B
although i do understand the issue of separation of church and state somewhat so i	2233	B
so	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
i don't know how you resolve that you know	2233	B
i also i mean i think that our i think that our schools look a lot worse nowadays	2233	B
relative to schools sort of in other countries as well i mean sort of like compared to the Japanese school system	2233	B
i was in a panel that would that addressed the issue of you know science and how our kids they're just very very far behind in science because	2233	B
a lot of them_1 just aren't going into it because they just don't know anything about it and how it's got to be upgraded now is all	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
 i think so you i- i- i read a little bit on that that that sounds interesting	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
oh well hopefully they'll resolve it soon	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
well i hope it all works out	2233	B
yeah i- i- i have i mean you say that your your kids are grown up and out of school now and i've yet to have any so	2233	B
so i'm not quite at home with the issues yet	2233	B
but i'm sure i'll it will hit me a little harder in a couple of years	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
oh i can't even i can't imagine it	2233	B
	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
my only hope is that uh is that whatever i'm going to wined of being college faculty somewhere i think	2233	B
and my and my only hope is that um whatever kids we have want to go to school wherever i teach	2233	B
because that typically is very otherwise i can't imagine it	2233	B
it would	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
no i	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
i- i don't i it completely beyond me i went to my under graduate uh education	2233	B
um on a lot of financial aid and where i am now i'm i'm only in graduate school because they waive tuition and	2233	B
they pay for school a little bit otherwise i would never	2233	B
be comfortable again	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
well they give some some financial aid for education they they advertise that they give it you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand dollars for	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
that's that's actually a great way i think i know i have lots of friends who are doing things like that	2233	B
i think it's a great way i couldn't i'm actually deaf in one ear so they wouldn't take me	2233	B
um but that is a real a real i mean that's a real good way to do it i think i think that you know these people are sort of getting the money and doing something for it so	2233	B
i think it's real good	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
anyway it's it's been it was nice meeting you	2233	B
and	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
no i'm not i'm just like you a person on the uh phone	2233	B
thing	2233	B
<silence>	2233	B
oh no	2233	B
	2233	A
well the problem we're having down here in public schools is is financing for one thing	2233	A
uh and and the uh	2233	A
the tax districts they're in the process of of rearranging the tax tax districts	2233	A
and uh some of the more rich schools are those are those schools that are financially well off are going to have to support those that aren't	2233	A
especially in the minority neighborhoods- neighborhoods	2233	A
and uh there's a lot of problems with that	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
a lot of debate going on with that	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah restructuring	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
right right	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah that's a problem down here it's uh	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
uh not no not too well	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah i think uh someone that really wanted it	2233	A
or i really don't understand- or i guess i do understand people that i guess that want to teach teach it's	2233	A
it must be inborn in them or something because they're certainly not going into it for the for the money nor the prestige or whatever	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
i think one thing too that's hurting the teachers	2233	A
as far as recruiting teachers is that the uh	2233	A
they've lost a lot of their their authority	2233	A
in the classroom	2233	A
	2233	A
well i mean uh they	2233	A
no more punishment per se	2233	A
i i'm speaking mostly of elementary	2233	A
uh	2233	A
you know it's	2233	A
if some if a teacher	2233	A
does anything that uh they're liable to have a law suit against them for	2233	A
for uh cruel and unjust punishment or whatever	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
it's uh	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
and of course you've got the drugs and the other problems that you were much more prevalent than when i was going to school	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
and uh also you know this is purely my	2233	A
my thoughts because i am i'm a Christian and i think when they took prayer out of school that uh	2233	A
uh	2233	A
i think it hurt	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
	2233	A
and	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah yeah i do too but uh	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
well i- i believe in freedom of but not freedom from	2233	A
if you understand what i mean	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
right	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
but uh we've like i say we've been redistricting here in Dallas has been a a major issue for i guess the last year	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah they uh	2233	A
they the voters voted one way and it	2233	A
and then uh some federal judge said no that was unconstitutional and they have had two or three votes	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
and the city council is divided over what the district should be because_1	2233	A
they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation representation	2233	A
and uh it it's just a big battle	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
but uh	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah and also	2233	A
the cost of it you know not not not great not uh public school but i can't imagine having to	2233	A
raise a kid now and and have to look to college	2233	A
uh in the next you know fifteen years or so later they go it's going up	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah i- i just don't see how a person could	2233	A
could put enough away enough money out of their paychecks to pay for our kids schooling within fifteen years	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah most kids is probably just going to have to do what i did	2233	A
either course the service i'm at i don't think gives a education uh after service	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
but uh that's how i got my- my education such as it was was going into it is service and then	2233	A
coming back coming out in three years and	2233	A
getting uh two years paid for	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
yeah	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
okay and i'm i'm glad to have met you oh are you with Texas Instruments	2233	A
<silence>	2233	A
oh okay i was wondering	2233	A
i guess this is not just Texas Instruments wide	2233	A
cause i worked for Texas- Texas Instruments that that's	2233	A
hi Chris this is Carol	2239	B
this is interesting uh question come up here uh proposal for people to young people to spend a year or two in the Peace Corps um or something like that doing public service i	2239	B
suppose the idea is to um	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
i don't know	2239	B
but but the point be to that get	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
it sure does	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
yeah i- i- i suppose the idea- the idea would be to get um people interested in public service	2239	B
and to um i don't know maybe people give give people- give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don't have	2239	B
um	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
well i tend to agree and um uh in that we do live in the United States and i think one of our uh one of the	2239	B
things that our country is based on is freedom of choice	2239	B
um forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life uh doing something that may not be or	2239	B
the timing that they want to do it or uh perhaps even you know	2239	B
maybe they would have something something else just just the idea of forcing someone to do something i- i'm pretty much against that	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
just on their own um-hum	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
that's right	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
	2239	B
i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i- i really don't think it would be feasible on our country	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
that's right yeah some young people do some young people start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents	2239	B
brothers and sisters things like that	2239	B
i suppose they may have exceptions but um	2239	B
i guess it all it would all boil down to	2239	B
i mainly i- i guess my question would be what what's the purpose what's what's trying to be accomplished by	2239	B
by that proposal	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
um-hum	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
more esoteric	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
you know i think that's true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i- i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but	2239	B
um	2239	B
i- i think they're being taught a lot	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
maybe to be more responsible	2239	B
and um	2239	B
hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in as fortunate	2239	B
as as perhaps they are	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
pardon me	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
you know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced um	2239	B
that's right	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
yeah it's an interesting idea but i think we do agree and	2239	B
at least i'm i'm i don't think i would vote for it if it came down to that	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
maybe just do our best to	2239	B
to do our own fair share and	2239	B
	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
	2239	B
that's right	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
well it's been nice talking to you about it i have to admit it's something i hadn't thought of before it it is interesting to think about it	2239	B
yes	2239	B
	2239	B
<silence>	2239	B
okay we'll talk to you later bye-bye	2239	B
	2239	B
<silence>	2239	A
hi	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
or doing or doing public service	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
well	2239	A
in order to go in order to join the Peace Corps you have to have a college degree	2239	A
and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and doing public service how are they supposed to support themselves	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
well yeah i think that's a good idea although i don't i think if it's something that's forced on you	2239	A
um i think that the attitude	2239	A
	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah from what i've read most people in the United States do do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives	2239	A
but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they're ready to do it	2239	A
um i don't think you can just snatch somebody away from	2239	A
you know you don't know what their circumstances are or what's going on in their life you can't just snatch them_1 away and make them_1 go do something they don't want to do	2239	A
sort of like the draft	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them_1 or are you going to provide them_1 with you know	2239	A
place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
that's true that's true	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
i'm not sure i'm not sure if it's a way to cut down government expenses or it's like you said that's something more you know to to make people aware	2239	A
yeah what's going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the population- that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
um-hum	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah	2239	A
yeah and i think that that's the trend now i think that's the trend now and i think people are a lot more willing to give of their time	2239	A
and help out	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah and get and get more out of it	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
so i think we or sounds like we pretty much agree	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
no i don't think i would either	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
do what you can when you can right then as long as you feel good about yourself and what you're doing to help i think that's more important than	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
	2239	A
nice talking	2239	A
<silence>	2239	A
yeah really	2239	A
 well it does kind of catch you by surprise	2239	A
 okay well thanks	2239	A
bye-bye	2239	A
	2239	A
	2227	A
okay so you watch Letterman- David Letterman	2227	A
well see our favorite TV show i i i live in a dorm and our favorite TV show is Cheers	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
okay well we try it like here they show it like every day	2227	A
and then like on Thursdays is the night where the new ones come on	2227	A
but we watch it like every day but i like late night we don't watch uh what we do is we stay up -until around one thirty and then they show the Twilight Zone at one thirty	2227	A
and so we just stay and watch that	2227	A
the what	2227	A
yeah	2227	A
i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned	2227	A
yeah it was really it was really	2227	A
oh well it was all full with uh shelves everywhere and we didn't have enough books to fill it up but	2227	A
but uh so what what do you like why do you like David Letterman	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
so the	2227	A
wait did you watch Saturday Night Live what he's got what	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
hey i got long hair wait- wait	2227	A
uh i don't know but people the other day i went into a bar and this guy asked me to dance all he saw was my hair	2227	A
and he goes do you want to dance i turn around and go what	2227	A
he goes do you want to dance i go no no he goes oh oh i'm sorry i go yeah you better be i go you better be so	2227	A
but okay so did- wait do you watch Saturday Night Live yesterday	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
yeah	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
no oh you missed Wayne's World Wayne's World was pretty cool	2227	A
so uh let's see what else uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the TV	2227	A
because we don't want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the TV set you know	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
what	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
yeah	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
	2227	A
well i i like i i just i just {bogused} on all my homework so it really didn't matter	2227	A
	2227	A
yeah i know and i did that all through college and it worked too	2227	A
	2227	A
so uh let's see what else like the news we don't watch because they're boring	2227	A
yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven't i seen this episode before you know	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
yeah i know	2227	A
and and in North Carolina- see the the the thing is like here they just they just give you like local news okay like a house burned down in this little town and were here and i go so what happened worldwide you know	2227	A
it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know	2227	A
so but uh let's see what else oh we watch like for example uh okay do you watch Star Trek	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
okay well i used to hate Star Trek	2227	A
i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it	2227	A
but then we started watching it and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind	2227	A
because what happened is like they have this hologram right where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you can touch everything and stuff but it's only a program and it's really great because sometimes it's like	2227	A
the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not but uh you know it's something to pass the time -until we do and then and then we watch football	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
which basketball	2227	A
college or	2227	A
<silence>	2227	A
well we got we got two teams of the ACC going there	2227	A
we got Duke and North Carolina	2227	A
but i mean the i mean there's nothing to do like for example yesterday	2227	A
uh they go some- some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right	2227	A
i hear no we're just you know it's like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh we're watching TV and i go no today we're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf	2227	A
and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it's like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean	2227	A
somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes	2227	A
because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit	2227	A
okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play	2227	A
and that's it it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it's it's like that i mean it's was it's just	2227	A
but when i went home that's all like they had on TV so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they're going oh my God and TV in Argentina's really bad	2227	A

 okay	2227	B
<silence>	2227	B
yeah you too	2227	B
bye	2227	B
	2227	B
okay capital punishment oh i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
applied at all	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
well i just- i just feel like	2231	A
there's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets you know	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
yes yes not	2231	A
getting paroled lets say in so many years i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
there has that's right	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
yeah yeah	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
that's right that's honestly right	2231	A
they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways	2231	A
you know	2231	A
but they sure are just	2231	A
because some innocent person can really it seems like really serve a rough time you know i'm not saying innocent person let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance	2231	A
you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street	2231	A
yes	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
time uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
yes i just i would just be i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole	2231	A
you know	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
um-hum yeah you get it back yeah	2231	A
yeah	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
but it's	2231	A
i- i know yeah	2231	A
same thing yes	2231	A
yes	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
 uh a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either you know thank goodness but still it- it could	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
yes	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
and as far as the other states i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is you know i- i haven't kept up you know anything like that	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
um-hum	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
but yes but still it came up though didn't it i mean you know	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
yes the victim is really	2231	A
seems like left out in the cold more or less doesn't it in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you know you think oh my goodness	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
or you know plead insanity	2231	A
you know and a lots of things	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
oh yes i think yeah- uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
yes i	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
it just just doesn't make sense i just	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh well like i said i live in a small place you know	2231	A
but uh	2231	A
 even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid but now i'm raising children	2231	A
it just- it really is	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
uh-huh	2231	A
<silence>	2231	A
see them_1 yep	2231	A
yeah it really is well we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon but i've enjoyed talking to you	2231	A
 bye okay bye-bye	2231	A
	2231	A
<silence>	2231	B
in the way that it's applied or that it's applied at all	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
so i how do you feel that it should be applied	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yes	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
that's i agree with that completely i know we don't have enough prisons but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people	2231	B
because_1 if they turn around they can get away they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and	2231	B
how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars	2231	B
and it's	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
well they certainly are living off our expense- at our expense	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
i didn't	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yes	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
um-hum	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
and and be paroled and and have served the sentence that's what that's what people face with that choice one thing i really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a in a trial on a capital murder trial or in	2231	B
cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to	2231	B
you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something	2231	B
and then turn around in thirty years that you know and less they're out	2231	B
even if if they're even in that long or they appeal and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time it was an extraordinary long length or something	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yeah	2231	B
i'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent i think people know that nobody that it doesn't	2231	B
you know it- it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective	2231	B
there's should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty you killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever this is what's going to happen	2231	B
and i mean it sounds horrible it i i hear myself saying this and	2231	B
but i don't know what else to do with some of these people that are because_1 they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again then they put them back in jail and they get out and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed	2231	B
and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system	2231	B
and it's like i said at our expense	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yes	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
i know i you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that	2231	B
something	2231	B
really horrible and they just get away with it and nothing happens	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yeah	2231	B
i think i think Texas is what- Texas the southern states seem to be	2231	B
somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty and i think i know California had it for a long time and then they um took it off the books they repealed it	2231	B
and people like Charles Manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison	2231	B
and are now now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty	2231	B
for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them like Manson who's come up	2231	B
you know it's been denied fortunately but	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death	2231	B
and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies and then they reinstated it later but the penalty didn't go back you know	2231	B
it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isn't protecting the rest of the people	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
um-hum	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yeah	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
and the the laws are all the rules some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior criminal history you know where he's raped ten women	2231	B
and then he gets up for this one trial and they don't find anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again	2231	B
and so they say well this is you know i- i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yeah well	2231	B
to some extent if they would do something with some of those people but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them_1 too	2231	B
they plead insanity and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
i mean it's a it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out i know in in the Dallas metroplex area i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself	2231	B
and i- i certainly i i grew up in a smaller town in Texas and it wasn't that way when i was younger	2231	B
we could go around and boy	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
yes ever you can't even	2231	B
when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard that i can't see them_1	2231	B
<silence>	2231	B
um-hum	2231	B
well good talking to you too bye bye	2231	B
	2231	B
where do you live	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
uh-huh well i used to i lived there for a long time but i'm now in Palo Alto California which is i think the recycling capital of the world	2249	A
so we have many recycling activities and i'm in in full uh support of all of them_1	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
um-hum	2249	A
well that's something but it it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um	2249	A
cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too but the um garbage men	2249	A
come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for uh aluminum and	2249	A
uh steel one for metals	2249	A
and one for glass and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them_1 in grocery bags	2249	A
	2249	A
uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape	2249	A
and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way they're bound	2249	A
they uh it's too expensive to recycle them at my office we have	2249	A
two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail and they're uh	2249	A
one's for white paper and one's for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or	2249	A
things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and there's no way to get rid of them_1 it just seems like such a waste	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
um-hum	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got	2249	A
so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be	2249	A
a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things	2249	A
we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they're about four feet high	2249	A
and you get them_1 for i think it's about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them_1 by the dozen	2249	A
and then you put all your yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be {compostible}	2249	A
and those and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays	2249	A
and then the uh they take them_1 to a special part of our dump where {composting} is	2249	A
and now in full swing and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flowerbeds	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
right	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
no i think it's it- it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up	2249	A
than to get that two cents when you take it to the store we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans	2249	A
for cash but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
uh-huh	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused	2249	A
they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill	2249	A
and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as it's clean they don't want the a plastic bag that's full of goop	2249	A
here they don't want your rotted tomatoes but they want	2249	A
any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle so right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles	2249	A
and there right outside the	2249	A
that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers	2249	A
and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
oh yeah	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
well how nice that's great	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
um-hum	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
um-hum	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
well that's they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost	2249	A
pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh	2249	A
three weeks after Christmas and	2249	A
uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths	2249	A
so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
and they even picked up our uh	2249	A
styrofoam plastic- packing materials	2249	A
they brought uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only	2249	A
if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that	2249	A
any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them_1 in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them	2249	A
but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
they don't mash they don't compress at all and they stay forever	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
um-hum	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff	2249	A
uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got China mugs for everybody	2249	A
so and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five year drought and so i- it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or	2249	A
uh China cups to use up our water	2249	A
but at the moment we're using the China cups	2249	A
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh you're supposed to keep it recycled every day	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yeah	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
yep	2249	A
<silence>	2249	A
it sure will well good to talk to	2249	A
<silence>	2249	B
uh in the Houston area	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh that's great	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh we are too our community is uh just starting to get	2249	B
organized about it they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them_1 off ourselves	2249	B
and uh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
i think that's great there's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out i don't know if it's	2249	B
the if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh	2249	B
bins	2249	B
oh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh that's great	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
yeah we're we're all for it our um we've got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh	2249	B
you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
yes	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
um-hum	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh it does it does but i'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them_1 if you know	2249	B
you know there i've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy	2249	B
and so you know you could always apply the magazines toward that	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
yes	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
 oh i know it	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
um-hum	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh that's great	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
right well that's a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling	2249	B
like that because you know i've talked to many people and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it	2249	B
uh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
yeah oh yeah you know and i don't mind you know at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that but now you know i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh i oh i know it	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
um-hum	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
 we have i know of one that the one that we use uh	2249	B
has uh recycling for the bags	2249	B
and uh	2249	B
and they're promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh that's great	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
 yes	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
i understand uh my husband about once a weekend he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out	2249	B
and he'll go pick them_1 up because he just can't stand that he he	2249	B
and uh it's so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also	2249	B
i remember at Christmas the the only thing that i'm when you were talking about the {composting} the only thing that our city did that was they did- uh provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees	2249	B
uh to for them to mulch	2249	B
for for city use	2249	B
and-	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
right	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
uh-huh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
right well see that's one	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
well the but uh something need- does need to be done about the styrofoam	2249	B
that uh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
oh yeah i mean they don't uh uh	2249	B
no	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
right and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh	2249	B
they're recycling them_1 into other plastics	2249	B
and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized	2249	B
along those lines	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
right	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
um-hum	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
right	2249	B
oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fast-food restaurants	2249	B
that if everybody uh and so yeah i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam	2249	B
but uh	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
um	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
well that's good	2249	B
that's uh	2249	B
they should last a while	2249	B
<silence>	2249	B
i believe we are i- i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening	2249	B
and so it'll it'll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it	2249	B
	2263	B
okay	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B

<silence>	2263	B
i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
that's kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
uh Copperheads mostly	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
no they're	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah one year they were they were just everywhere i don't know what it was we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year there was	2263	B
just Copperheads everywhere	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to	2263	B
pretty much hike out most of the time	2263	B
if it rained we were stuck back in there had a four wheel drive so we could	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
you just get used to it	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah this cave that we used to go in was little it was small it was more	2263	B
yeah it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah he's about a year and a half younger	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah yeah it was	2263	B
saw a few bears	2263	B
things like that	2263	B
yeah	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah the first first couple of times it's pretty scary but uh	2263	B
after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too so	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
but	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
oh really	2263	B
i don't know if they don't have them up there do they	2263	B
yeah oh do they	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah they down here they they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them_1 i don't know what it's like now i haven't been back up there in awhile	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
well it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too	2263	B
so	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
well i think we're about to run out of our time	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
yeah i'm sure i will	2263	B
<silence>	2263	B
you too bye	2263	B
	2263	B
	2263	A
okay	2263	A
they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
oh i can camp just about most anyway camping or uh	2263	A
motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
oh really	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
oh	2263	A
you really rough it then	2263	A
uh-huh do you do that very often	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
you'd have a lot of hills in that down in that area	2263	A
yeah	2263	A
that would be really great	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
pardon	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh that sounds like it'd be fun did you go alone or with a group or	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
uh-huh oh that's great long as it's not raining	2263	A
	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
um-hum	2263	A
really	2263	A
oh that would	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh well i'm in Pennsylvania	2263	A
yes	2263	A
are you in Texas now	2263	A
oh okay	2263	A
most everybody i've been talking to is from Texas but uh we're up here in western northwestern part of Pennsylvania	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh well you kind of know what it's like then	2263	A
yeah but we've uh we've done uh	2263	A
many types of camping we've we've done tent camping and	2263	A
we had access to a motor home which is really super great if you don't want to rough it too much	2263	A
and uh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
right just get you away from the everyday things that are going on we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh Delaware along the ocean- ocean most every year	2263	A
and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks	2263	A
and uh we really enjoyed that	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
oh maybe my dropping my phone is that better	2263	A
	2263	A
oh but	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
yeah well we used to we don't as much anymore but uh we used to we kind of slowed down a little bit	2263	A
 but uh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
i think the worst the worst thing is when it's raining if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping	2263	A
then it can be kind of bad	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
i don't think i would like that what kind	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
oh those aren't too pleasant	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
yeah we have some of them around here	2263	A
you probably have more there though i would imagine	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
oh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh but you still backpacked and camped out	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
yeah i guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing yeah	2263	A
yeah i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
	2263	A
uh-huh is your brother younger than you or	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2263	A
well that's great that'd be a lot of fun you have a lot good experiences from that yeah	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
did you really	2263	A
what black ones	2263	A
yeah	2263	A
that would be exciting	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
yeah- yeah they're usually more afraid of you than uh you are of them usually	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
they're on the increase in this area	2263	A
um-hum	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
the black bear oh yeah yeah the population's been really- really up they've uh	2263	A
they've had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
uh-huh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
yeah	2263	A
but uh we we really like camping i i must say that uh	2263	A
we have- we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping and uh	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
yeah yeah	2263	A
it's just so it's a lot of work too it's uh getting- you know getting ready and taking care of everything but it's um	2263	A
it's really refreshing	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
so	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
i think so	2263	A
well it was really good hearing from you and i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it	2263	A
okay thanks a lot and you have a good day okay bye-bye	2263	A
	2263	A
<silence>	2263	A
<silence>	2278	A
and i guess	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
well	2278	A
i kind of like them_1 all i played for about eighteen years all- all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them_1 up after college but	2278	A
	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
no not quite	2278	A
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but	2278	A
anyway uh being in Rochester you probably like the Mets	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
	2278	A
oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
oh okay	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
i see yeah i i like the uh uh i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i'd i	2278	A
anymore uh well as i kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia	2278	A
i'm from New Jersey originally	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah well we were thirty miles south of them_1 so	2278	A
right yeah right down the river but uh so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
um-hum	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team that was that was the year that uh they beat Houston in uh extra innings right	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
 yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
hey the guy's making millions he ought to be able to perform right	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
well his knees were bothering him yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah for having him out there	2278	A
 sure	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
oh oh boy	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah i think we were all pretty much uh Astros fans in the in the National- National League Championship Series but there's like two fellows	2278	A
from uh Brooklyn	2278	A
and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much Mets fans	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared of very much you know	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
 really	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
okay okay well i'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from Brooklyn	2278	A
	2278	A
so i'm kind of hoping i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the Rangers though they were uh they're they're they're they they have the i think they have the best	2278	A
facilities in the major leagues	2278	A
i love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium it's great	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
the only problem is it's not large enough it only holds about i think they squeezed- when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there	2278	A
yeah so they're they're they have plans i mean the the owner tried to move them_1 to Florida but uh	2278	A
they ended up sticking around in Arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas so that's	2278	A
that's something that we're looking forward to	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
oh yeah- case in point Toronto	2278	A
yeah have you seen a game up there	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
oh boy i saw i i was up there on business uh last June and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal that's that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
uh-huh	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
now is- is Rochester where where is Cornell University	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
Ithaca	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
okay	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah well Rochester's like right on the shores isn't it	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah okay	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
 okay	2278	A
uh well they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
yeah okay	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
those games are fun to watch you you you watch those games	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
um-hum um-hum	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
	2278	A
yeah we used to like watching my my folks lived down in Beaumont and uh on- on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the the Beaumont Golden Gators	2278	A
who were a double A team for the Padres i think but uh they they were fun games to watch	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
sometimes- well there's definitely a lot more hitting	2278	A
	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
so as far as the major league teams i don't know it- the Rangers have been you- you know every year they they always knock on a door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of June	2278	A
but they they've got so much young raw talent it's just amazing and then they just haven't been able to put anything together	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
um-hum	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
um-hum	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
right	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah i mean they've been	2278	A
they've been young for a while and they're almost- almost starting to age a little bit here i just um yeah they they're they're really hurting pitching wise i mean they've got Ryan but you know who knows	2278	A
what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and	2278	A
but it'll it'll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we we usually try to get to opening day game there's several guys from our church try to go up there	2278	A
yeah well i i guess we're probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas	2278	A
no not too bad about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
	2278	A
that's probably because_1 of the roads you just don't yeah we we've just got a freeway we just get right on the freeway and just go north	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
well it's so crowded up there	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
golly	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
um	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
well i don't know you're you're you're like a boat ride from how- how far is it across the lake to Canada Toronto	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
you do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
yeah	2278	A
yeah it's a it's a beautiful city	2278	A
i really like it	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
um-hum	2278	A
so and then and then you go back to New York after school	2278	A
or New York City	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
oh really	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
well what what kind of weather are you having right now	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
oh boy yeah we've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago already	2278	A
we're it's	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
golly because_1 of the ice	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
hum	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
golly	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
 huh illegal	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
oh yeah	2278	A
<silence>	2278	A
<silence>	2278	B
okay um so uh um uh do you have any favorite teams	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh i was going to say you played pro ball	2278	B
not quite huh	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
well that's pretty good	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yes i'm actually a Met's fan i'm i'm one of these people who's actually a	2278	B
die hard Met fan and an avid Yankee hater	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah it's it's i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason	2278	B
i never found- i never quite found a New York fan	2278	B
i've always found a fan you know of of either one or the other and	2278	B
so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox	2278	B
by default because_1 i went to college also in Boston	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah so that that's sort of close enough	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh so you were pretty close	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
well i don't know um there's there's a part of me that says that you know i'm i'm sort of glad Strawberry went away	2278	B
you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know	2278	B
um i think they're okay i think they're you know i think they have enough people who are	2278	B
who are who are still in their prime you know um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um	2278	B
just eight years ago or something they're they're they're they're you know they're sort of in in good standing whereas you know um i think	2278	B
i certainly don't think that they're the eighty six team anymore	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah i	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
right that was year they beat Houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by	2278	B
by sort of a sneaky route um against Boston	2278	B
when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner- to Buckner	2278	B
i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
that's right well actually he he he was supposedly um there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i	2278	B
right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame the team that uh hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in	2278	B
that's right so	2278	B
so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at Boston at the time	2278	B
so i it was actually wonderful because_1 where i was there were half Met fans and um half Sox fans	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah yeah well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared	2278	B
after the uh	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
well that's good well yeah Brooklyn boys i guess	2278	B
 you don't expect them_1 to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there um	2278	B
yeah so i i was- i was also born in Brooklyn so i so i can call myself a Brooklyn thug although i'm really not	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
	2278	B
well that that's actually i think that makes something because_1 i think and and and as much as sort of fan support helps	2278	B
you know it's good to have um	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yes it is kind of small	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
right	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh that's	2278	B
oh that's great so	2278	B
yeah that'll be nice i mean that that i think tends to just keep i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy	2278	B
and	2278	B
yeah exactly	2278	B
uh i haven't been to any Toronto games yet but um	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
of stadiums yeah well i i mean to get up there i mean the the best i've been up here so far you know up in in in up state New York is uh is um	2278	B
a Rochester Red Wings game	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
uh Cornell is in Ithaca	2278	B
uh yeah so Cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us	2278	B
so if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of is- uh	2278	B
yeah we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city	2278	B
um but that	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh really i never- i hadn't actually known that	2278	B
well um	2278	B
but we have our own um our our own triple A team here	2278	B
the Redwings which is the uh farm team for the Orioles so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here they're the they're the big team in Rochester	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh i yeah i actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them_1 every year because they're fun because_1 they're	2278	B
lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um	2278	B
especially you know and i'll um i'll make a day game or something but they really seem to um people really get into it i mean i	2278	B
i can't i i again i can't make any predictions about them but i suspect they'll go uh they'll go far	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah those- those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yes it's true well	2278	B
it's one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know i guess- i guess when you start pitching real well well move them_1 up bam you know there goes the little the uh worst team	2278	B
yeah but um so what	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
	2278	B
 uh	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
well the way i the way i see it is i mean um you know i i can use a Met analogy here	2278	B
if you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of	2278	B
well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty um eighty four or or eighty three or or eighty five you know when they were first when they weren't quite the eighty six team that that that they were um	2278	B
i that that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
right but that that's if if-	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh that must be nice	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
well see that isn't too bad a couple hours	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah well it'd take me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium	2278	B
 so so i don't know i don't	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down but it's still it's um	2278	B
it's it's almost four hundred hours- i mean i mean it it's almost four hundred you know barring traffic it's four hundred hours i mean i mean four hundred miles- four hundred hours right four hundred miles	2278	B
barring traffic so it's um it it's uh you know it's it's a heck of a drive we are substantially north of New York enough that uh we don't get to go play	2278	B
too often	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
Toronto	2278	B
oh Toronto's only about two hours yeah Toronto i mean i i want to go see	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
um i can i've actually i've driven	2278	B
but i've heard about the ferry as well haven't taken it yet though have you taken it	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
yeah um i i really love i i think that's one of the most uh enjoyable things about being up here i'm only up here for school	2278	B
so i	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
uh no probably south maybe Texas actually	2278	B
some place south and warm i don't i'm not a warm- i'm not a big uh i'm not a big uh cold fan	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
uh right now we're actually having uh	2278	B
it's getting nice i mean it was in the high fifties today but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm	2278	B
<silence>	2278	B
oh that's great	2278	B
yeah well about that same time branches were falling off everywhere and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks	2278	B
okay it didn't make the national- national- national- national news too much which i find really weird	2278	B
but um we were i mean um you know all schools were closed for almost for for over or for for a week	2278	B
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive	2278	B
yeah because they had so many power lines down and so many uh	2278	B
and so many things like that so they were	2278	B
<silence>	2252	A
well what is your view do you consider the Soviet Union a threat	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
sure	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
right	2252	A
it's it's hard to to know anymore if it's uh a threat one way or another because	2252	A
uh it used to be so- so much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it	2252	A
and now that with Gorbachev is introducing more i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though	2252	A
you know everybody's following the same pattern and uh the- the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people you never know well Gorbachev's future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was	2252	A
the head of uh the communist party was seen as you know untouchable	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
yeah- exactly	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
right	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
	2252	A
right well it it's amazing just because of the drain it's been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to uh withstand that a little better	2252	A
but uh the Russian economy they you know they i don't know what the percentage is but i heard it one time it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine	2252	A
and finally you know who knows maybe they're finally waking up and saying you know we can't afford this	2252	A
uh the US isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be you know even if they're saying that beneath the doors	2252	A
but it's hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
right	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
expend	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
uh-huh	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
well it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy that- that was here in you know twenty years ago	2252	A
uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have have not been world powers	2252	A
so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union would've	2252	A
who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will we've been more just rhetoric uh rather than going in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
uh-huh	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
exactly	2252	A
yeah uh that	2252	A
personally i don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat and i think he's actually honestly trying to do some change	2252	A
but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
uh-huh	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
right	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
yeah that was always kind of interesting people you know a lot of my friends have a taken the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic you know if i'm	2252	A
a Soviet and- if part of you know south let's say South Dakota wanted to succeed- you know succeed	2252	A
am i going to stand for that now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with	2252	A
uh and that they may have been forced i'm not that familiar with their future but i you know i it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than uh a volunteer or willingness to join but	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
and then just never given back	2252	A
yeah	2252	A
well that whole uh the whole idea- idea if you look at the Russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer	2252	A
and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that	2252	A
 that buffer isn't going to help you you can like- i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the	2252	A
the uh all their buffer area is between Jordan and uh the Sinai and- and Lebanon was just as a buffer but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there	2252	A
yeah there's there's very little that that buys you anymore in today's technology	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
 that's probably very true very- that's very interesting never thought of that	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
nobody knows to do	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
is it real	2252	A
uh-huh	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
right exactly	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
i get confused between all the which is the Soviet provinces versus what are the the Russian provinces versus what are	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
right	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
oh as a as a vote	2252	A
sure sure	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
	2252	A
	2252	A
died down on that i thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a military force but it's merely an economic now	2252	A
well yeah- i mean at yeah exactly	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
um-hum	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
exactly and- and all the	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
well that's what they're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize Europe what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there	2252	A
<silence>	2252	A
what's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have uh a million plus people in the industry- you know in each country from the US	2252	A
<silence>	2252	B
i don't know that it's so much a military	2252	B
threat anymore as a	2252	B
	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
well you know it's- it's- it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess it it takes awhile to to get used to something	2252	B
you know if if they have completely changed- the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not you know not what they used to be uh	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah i think- you know the- the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we're getting uh sucked into something here you know if if somebody's about to	2252	B
to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore and uh	2252	B
 um you know i'd i'd like to think that that isn't true but uh i- i you know the evidence is that	2252	B
uh you know he's he's let some some stuff go you know the east German situation it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know if i'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book i'd say no no no that didn't couldn't have happened that way	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah i- i think you know what i'd have to i- i guess- i guess to answer the question directly i'm still just a a little bit	2252	B
you know leery of the whole thing what i haven't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation you know it's it's one thing you know to let us go ahead and-	2252	B
sort of disarm and you know i even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might've been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know expend some	2252	B
some military hardware of course it didn't turn out that way and uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it i don't know	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
i don't know	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah or or we can do something about it yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
well the- the China situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the	2252	B
in uh Red Square or wherever said okay and that's enough and the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that and	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some- some pretty hard by the socialism and uh	2252	B
you know the- the reaction	2252	B
 you know the- the economic well the uh the social structure of the Soviet Union you know it it's it's coming apart at the seams	2252	B
you know and i've heard people say well you know it's just like the American Civil War will there be a union or not well no it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that	2252	B
the whole Soviet system was put together under total force you know there was no	2252	B
as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it you know they uh nobody voted- you know a lot man those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union they had no choice	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah there there was uh the whole thing was put together	2252	B
you know by force there's there's no no real question about that and some of the countries that were forced in at the- later dates is the three Baltic countries you know came in in the forties	2252	B
and uh it's well it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the Germans and then the Russians even took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back you know so that's a a little different situation	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum yeah they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany that said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and they're going to land in other places you know that's going to be the safest place to be yeah	2252	B
yeah yeah well uh i- i guess	2252	B
what they'd have to do to uh	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
 i really don't know you know in in the uh in you know i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears you know some reason or other	2252	B
you know is- is uh it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute you know what's uh what's what's really happening here	2252	B
but you wonder how well this thing Boris- who was it Boris Yeltsin the guy that's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the Soviet for the Russian republic which is i guess the	2252	B
uh the biggest	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
um-hum	2252	B
well in the center but you got uh the the great big area that's just was traditionally known as Russia	2252	B
and then all these little nationality groups around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever you know and these were all the Soviet autonomists	2252	B
 you know they had some real fancy names for them a matter of fact when the uh	2252	B
yeah what i read when the uh the uh United Nations was setup in in San Francisco one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh	2252	B
of these	2252	B
you know republics as a separate country you know so there'd be there'd be nineteen rather than one	2252	B
and uh the United States said well that'd mean we get to bring in forty eight you know and uh that sort of you know they backed down on that	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah well i wonder if that whether- uh whether- whether get shot by something that's called uh an economic force or whether it's called a military pact you know it's all you can change the name of something but i wonder if it's still	2252	B
exists although i've seen some evidence that you know the uh the Russian soldiers	2252	B
well the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because_1 there's they're having a housing shortages now what do you do with all these	2252	B
troops that have been taken care of by uh Bulgaria and and Czechoslovakia and now all of a sudden they're going home and somebody's got to pay for their	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah well that's not	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
yeah	2252	B
<silence>	2252	B
	2240	A
okay Bob um our project's painting um	2240	A
do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting's a good idea or a bad idea	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
oh that's yeah that's for sure um what kind of paint do you like to use	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
yeah	2240	A
then you don't have you don't have that mess to clean up when you use an oil oil base painting and boy i'll tell you oh	2240	A
um we uh	2240	A
i designed and built my own home about_1 twelve years ago	2240	A
and it was one of the uh you know the old New England saltbox	2240	A
so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just a couple years older i'm not going to want to climb up on a ladder	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
so we put uh	2240	A
white cedar shingles on the house and let it weather naturally	2240	A
and the trim instead of painting i stained	2240	A
so i figured instead of going out there and scraping and you know having a having to climb up on a ladder	2240	A
the stain kind of just uh it weathers	2240	A
so i eliminated that	2240	A
chore that i don't have to do that i stained	2240	A
the original stain and i stained once since then because it started fading a little bit	2240	A
but other than that	2240	A
um i'm like you i like to use a latex paint on the inside we've uh we've done some uh walls	2240	A
the ones we haven't papered we've done in uh uh latex uh uh pastels	2240	A
and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little soap and water and air dry them_1 and you don't have to worry about that	2240	A
	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a three foot extension	2240	A
so you can climb up on the walls and the ceilings we didn't paint the ceilings was just natural plaster	2240	A
so i didn't want to get into doing anything there it's just uh	2240	A
so far it's okay you know we haven't had any problems with it	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
yeah so you're lucky too you don't have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
how do you control the amount of flow or anything	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
well is there a little electric pump you put in there	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
hum that's interesting	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
yeah	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
you really have a problem down there with with	2240	A
having to repaint with with paint blistering or peeling off or	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
oh that's there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah that's right	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
so you're in the same position that i'm in i've i've only done mine twice and you've you've done yours twice too well once was on there and then you just had to do it once	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
no no	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
oh like This Old House	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
hum	2240	A
so they just when they when they put the plaster walls up they just tinted the plaster	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
hum yeah that's interesting no ours you know wouldn't they were just regular plaster walls	2240	A
and then some of them_1 you know like the kitchen and the bathrooms we uh we had put paper up	2240	A
and actually the uh bedrooms upstairs too but but the rest of it and i- i just don't like papering i painting is is a lot easier	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
all right so you don't have a a lot of paint either	2240	A
uh-huh	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
yeah	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
oh they get yeah yeah and that's something we don't we get uh we've got on oil fired hot water baseboard	2240	A
so and it doesn't generate uh there's a little dust on it once in a while but it's not even like hot air	2240	A
so and we don't use gas in fact there wasn't any gas in the in the street when we built there was no houses around	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
um so we didn't have that problem um	2240	A
i've got a wood stove	2240	A
and i thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn't it's wood it's uh	2240	A
air tight yeah so that even that doesn't doesn't create a problem but i think uh	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
more and more people are getting away from paint they're they're doing other things um especially with the oil base	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
yep yep	2240	A
and there's there's less maintenance	2240	A
yeah you don't have to	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
	2240	A
yeah that's right	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
oh i hate hanging paper that is oh that's one of the jobs that i just i'd do anything else but i'll i'll um	2240	A
but papering and uh and and putting up uh drywall for the plaster i hate that stuff too you know i just contracted that stuff out and	2240	A
i did the papering	2240	A
you know when we built but	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
that's not my uh that's not my cup of tea	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
yeah	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
so what are the other questions that i'm actually i had a house um my home before this one was uh was a Cape Ann and i wasn't up and down too that was uh that was kind of high and that was painted um	2240	A
we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh so-so i had scraped- i had to do a lot of scraping	2240	A
and then i put uh	2240	A
uh water base paint over	2240	A
the uh oil	2240	A
and it was eight years before i had to do it again	2240	A
and uh and the manufacturer	2240	A
recommended that uh he gave me uh i can't remember what the solution was and he said just uh wash your house down with it	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
and then uh you know with a long brush and then just hose it all down and i had the whole yard was full of soap suds	2240	A
and he said just paint over that and we sold the house oh well twelve years ago	2240	A
and i don't think they've repainted since	2240	A
so that's held up	2240	A
<silence>	2240	A
and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh	2240	A
water base and then before we sold it there was another one and i'd wash the house down and all that	2240	A
and it's it's held up	2240	A
okay	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
well- well of course uh it depends i guess on what you're uh oh oh what you're you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're going to paint yourself uh	2240	B
i've painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i've painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and	2240	B
you know and i usually find it uh pretty easy and and it's cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it	2240	B
it's um yeah yeah it	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
well i- i nearly always use a latex base uh especially for interior uh the brands uh you know vary but uh Sherwin Williams makes a pretty good paint and Jones Blair and	2240	B
you know Kelley i think makes pretty good paint so	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah right right	2240	B
you know um	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
right	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
right yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
the what kind of what kind of equipment do you use uh i mean just brush and roller or	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
uh-huh	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah that's uh i- i did a had to paint the uh my brick my house is brick on the outside except for the overhangs and you know like a a little bit of uh	2240	B
what do you call the the eaves and stuff and uh	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah yeah	2240	B
but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller	2240	B
that uh it's really designed for indoor use but it's got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller	2240	B
and and it works pretty good	2240	B
well it's got a uh got a regulator on it that you just set the set the deal on it you know for the the flow and then it's got a trigger on it	2240	B
that you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah it's an electric- just a little electric pump motor that uh	2240	B
turns on and off you know builds up pressure so that it you know it kind of	2240	B
pushes the paint up this uh up the extension	2240	B
it's a uh Black and Decker brand and and it works pretty good like i said it was designed for indoor use you know for painting walls and ceilings but i found it worked pretty good for outdoors uh	2240	B
there's certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldn't do very well because of the temperature and stuff but	2240	B
but uh the right time of year it works pretty good	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
well if if you buy a good grade of paint uh you don't really uh of course Texas heat you know you it really gets pretty hot outside so you have to be sure and get a good grade of paint	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
for the direct sunlight and stuff	2240	B
right but uh	2240	B
but i- i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really- really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it	2240	B
and we painted one time since then but you know it's probably going to be time to paint again	2240	B
in a couple of years	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
right	2240	B
right so and uh yeah	2240	B
on the on the interior do you do uh do y'all have a lot of uh plaster walls that the the uh color is built into the plaster so you don't paint a lot	2240	B
oh	2240	B
yeah i- i watch uh some of these TV programs you know how to do it's you know you fix it	2240	B
you fix it so	2240	B
yeah This Old House and some of those and i- i really haven't you know haven't paid a lot of attention to to whether or not you do painting on on top of plaster or not so	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
so i hadn't hadn't really thought about that	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
well that's what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well they're white walls you know unless it's white if you want white walls then white plaster is uh doesn't need to be painted or that was my impression anyway i'm not sure	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
but uh	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
uh-huh	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
right yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah that's	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah well we really have uh our our bedrooms i guess are the ones that have uh that have to be painted uh	2240	B
we've got paper on uh our dining room and kitchen and bathrooms and then we've got paneling in our family room and game room	2240	B
so	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
but we don't have a lot of paint inside of course the ceilings are you know all all have to be painted	2240	B
but uh but they don't require a lot if the only the problem that i've seen in the past is like when you've got uh if you've got natural gas and heat of course you don't	2240	B
in the east i suppose you don't have a lot of natural gas heat but if you don't have your your heat adjusted your gas adjusted right	2240	B
then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know ceiling- ceiling-	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
right	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah so	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
if it's been a dry	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
yeah but the paneling and the wallpapering and the	2240	B
and that kind of stuff are alike	2240	B
the	2240	B
um-hum yeah it's and it's been nice to not have to worry about painting the these rooms that we've got to have the paneling on them_1	2240	B
	2240	B
so well we did do that we we stripped the paint off or the paper off of one of our you know off of our part of our house and then repapered it and it's that was not any fun	2240	B
but uh we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the actually put the paper up	2240	B
next time i think i'll do it the other way around let them strip and i'll hang the paper	2240	B
uh-huh	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah yeah that's	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah it's there hanging the hanging the drywall is not uh not a lot of fun you got to you got to really pay attention and and know pretty much what your doing with that to get it up and get the the uh seams and everything	2240	B
covered up just right and all that so it's	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
oh yeah	2240	B
they are	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
oh that's	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
well now that's	2240	B
and that's an oil base on the bottom and then a water base	2240	B
over that	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
um-hum	2240	B
yeah	2240	B
<silence>	2240	B
all right well on this subject i really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet	2295	A
but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home so i've always been involved you know in one	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
well i've	2295	A
yes well i can kind of see both sides you know i really can	2295	A
um nursing homes to me i- i would personally be the last resort you know i really- you know if i had to put someone in there	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yeah if it's a have to thing yeah i yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh	2295	A
yeah well i kind of think that's true too i guess because it's so under staffed you know	2295	A
that's like everything else though	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
 yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yes but yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yeah	2295	A
yeah i know because_1 i've always well my sister's involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job	2295	A
but still there's those little things that happens you know there really is which i think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that	2295	A
you know if you just can't take care of them_1 any more	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh that's it yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
other things	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i- i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at	2295	A
not just	2295	A
i do too	2295	A
outside's awful deceiving sometimes	2295	A
you know	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yeah yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
cares- yeah yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
off yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
to oh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
um-hum and everything you worked for- so hard for all your life yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
now there is some really nice ones there's also you know some private ones you know	2295	A
but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know i mean that's way out of my reach	2295	A
	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh the very same yeah yeah	2295	A
yeah	2295	A
but i there's i think there's ways around it though that you know	2295	A
like they could put it in one of their children's names or something	2295	A
you know but still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that you know it's their money	2295	A
you know that's how i feel about it anyway	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yes yeah	2295	A
yeah my mother's seventy now so naturally she's retired but she's still on her own i mean you know	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yeah	2295	A
i think that's wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
uh-huh they're not lonely	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
oh yes uh-huh	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
yeah	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
no	2295	A
<silence>	2295	A
around yeah	2295	A
but i really don't know what the other solution would be you know i really don't	2295	A
But no when the time comes i'm really hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents	2295	A
really do because i have been raised in one you know	2295	A
so there's lot of things i know to look for	2295	A
and i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either you know i really don't it really would yes	2295	A
yes and like- like i said my sister's still in it and i really don't think my mother want to be there either	2295	A
oh	2295	A
well it's been nice talking to you and i guess we'd better get back to work huh all right bye-bye	2295	A
	2295	A
<silence>	2295	B
uh-huh	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
how do you feel about them i mean since you've kind of been close to that	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
uh-huh	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
well i've had a touch of experience my um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him	2295	B
and uh she put him in but he wasn't there very long before he died but	2295	B
um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay	2295	B
but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
um-hum	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
 i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home but i've never actually been there and i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about	2295	B
but still i'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yeah	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
well sometimes you don't have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well family's tied up with	2295	B
their own lives and things and usually working and	2295	B
it's hard to	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
 yes	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
um-hum i think that's important too in fact there's a	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yes	2295	B
there's one uh close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to um	2295	B
walk in on your own in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um	2295	B
they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time	2295	B
but it's always uh well and they have a long waiting list too so there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door so you can't wait until you're too bad off	2295	B
but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yeah and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i'm you know i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment	2295	B
so it's kind of a that's a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
um-hum	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yeah that's the problem the expense of it all is	2295	B
and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately	2295	B
but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care	2295	B
	2295	B
so i don't like that aspect	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yeah	2295	B
	2295	B
this is	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
that's right	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
well yeah i've talked to my mother about that several times lately and i- i said well i want you to have control of your own business	2295	B
but you know what if	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yeah yeah my mother's uh seventy five	2295	B
and still has her own home and everything	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yeah	2295	B
that's true they have a lot of people around to do things with some of those places have wonderful activities and things	2295	B
you know lots of stuff going on and they'll take them_1 places and	2295	B
so i don't know it's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really	2295	B
have some problems if you can't get around and do things	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
no	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
um-hum	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
yeah	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
	2295	B
yeah	2295	B
that might be kind of tough huh	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
	2295	B
<silence>	2295	B
well you too	2295	B
okay bye	2295	B
	2295	B
	2257	B
i don't think we have any choice	2257	B
as long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam except jack around with it	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
i don't think there's ever going to be peace in in the Middle East	2257	B
mostly it it just that that region never had had peace even as far back in biblical times it's never been peaceful	2257	B
you know the Arabs just don't like the Jews and- the Jews don't like the Arabs and then half the Arabs don't like the other Arabs	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
no because you i- i don't think the Mideast has the educational background i- i- i don't think they're later they're rate of literacy is so low that they're still they still have a trouble mentality	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
well- well you don't find many intelligent people starting wars you know	2257	B
you know uh basically the more intelligent people do not want to fight one uh because they've already been there all you have to do is go fight one and find out it's not much fun i've spent uh over twenty eight months in Vietnam so and i mean it's not it's not a lot of fun	2257	B
uh it's as years go by it becomes more fun now than it was twenty eight years ago you know but uh	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
and you forget some of the smells and stuff like that but i think you know probably the probably the Middle East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality not only the Mideast but also in in the what they call the emergency African nations the third world	2257	B
uh as soon as one tribe gets the power they just knock off they're old ancestral enemies and it's pretty you know	2257	B
it's pretty much that way over the Mideast	2257	B
and you have the Palestinian question and there hasn't been a Palestine over there for God since you know	2257	B
two hundred years three hundred years before Christ was born and but but you have people that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork going oh yes we want a Palestine nation but there hasn't been one for you know well over two thousand years	2257	B
but you have this troubled mentality they all you know like the Kurds or the Shiite Muslims or whatever but it's basically all all based on the a a tribal network	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
out of some degree yeah to some degree but uh religion is a factor over there but uh i think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
well they have the same problem we do yeah- i mean you you know everybody there's Christianity and then you then we have subdivided Baptists and Lutherans and Protestants and Christians and Catholics and stuff it's basically all the same	2257	B
uh but but the Muslims are not as liberal in their interpretation of of the Kuran as we are in our interpretation of the Bible	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
you get the more the more i guess you call the more militant sect of the Shiites who you know if you're not a Muslim and and you don't adhere- adhere strictly to it	2257	B
then you're nothing and you're just you're you're just getting lip service much like uh the Ayatollah Khomeini	2257	B
he's a he's a prime example	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
oh i'd i- i will but seriously doubt that- that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war infections that are they can't even agree on which facet of of uh Muslim they want to follow	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
well we only we have two choices we can be involved or not involved if we're not involved then we're going to be sitting over here freezing in the dark	2257	B
uh we probably could with ultimate fuel supplies and uh some relaxation of our old uh policies here survive but we're not going to do that	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
no there's there hasn't been any real you know alternating energy situations- situations or or sources played out nobody wants to do it somebody has to make the hard decision and whoever does that will be a one term president	2257	B
yeah	2257	B
it's kind of like uh Texas income tax whoever you know whoever puts that up is going to serve one term that's going to be it because_1 your going to be gone they may pass the uh state income taxes but that'll be the last thing they pass	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
nobody actually wants to make the hard decisions have to do is basically what we're doing now is pick some of the moderate uh Arabs or	2257	B
you know Muslims as and uh support them because they're because they will have more uh encounter with us as far as the educational and sociological economic background goes	2257	B
if you look over there you're not going to you don't see any Arabs driving uh	2257	B
racing cars	2257	B
they want Mercedes or Cadillacs or Lincolns	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
yeah so you know who's who produces those the US produces those and i think after the war no that we're not going to see a bunch of the Arab nations buying Russian equipment because the Russian equipment has gotten blown out of the sky or off the ground	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
you know and uh we we pretty much proved our worth in combat as it were and	2257	B
where did they get the uh where where does the expertise come for for bringing a whole lot of ground and it doesn't- doesn't come from Russia and it doesn't come from Europe it comes- comes from the United States	2257	B
who's going to put out their oil fires the United States	2257	B
we have the technology when we have the people and we go do it and i think we're going to i think we're going to be a president in a a presence in the Mideast from now on	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
 i- i- i agree a hundred percent on that after- after after all you know i mean everything Bush said Bush put down a deadline if if it wasn't meant to be one he'd attacked	2257	B
and that's the way you're supposed to do it instead of doing like Jimmy Carter did you know say well- you know uh um i'm getting out of the olympics and i'm going to give you back Panama	2257	B
you know i mean you either make your stand or you don't if you can't back it up just don't say anything	2257	B
and everything Bush said he backed up of course he course he had some real good help	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
yeah it's like and like Collin Powell and the rest and uh yeah Dick Cheney those people were real smart they're a lot smarter that any body gives credit for	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
Cheney's hard core you don't get to be Secretary of Defense by being a wimp	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
but he'd served in the military	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
oh yeah the whole i mean the whole thing was done well it was just you know	2257	B
it was uh of course he had to fight that to beat microscope anyway	2257	B
but i hesitate to call it a war since i mean it was	2257	B
	2257	B
although i- i wish instead of turning south you know and- taking a right turn and going down Kuwait City i wished we'd just turned left and gone toward Baghdad	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
i think we should have because_1 because_1 we're going- if we don't do it now we're going to have to do it shortly	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
but the only thing that'll save that is we won't get the credit for or the blame for the massacre and- and then if we do have to to go back in it will be because_1 you know someone asked us to	2257	B
and of course now's the time to do it because_1 since we have the army over there i'd sure hate to you know spend eight months pulling them_1 out and then turn right around send them back over again	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
oh yeah they shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet	2257	B
they just- you know just- just level the whole place and let it go but we're going to have to be over there and we're and our presence is going to have to be felt and they've got to be strong presidents or presence uh if we don't then i think that we're going to be back there	2257	B
you know in the Jimmy Carter- uh Carter era you know wringing your hands and going trust me trust me	2257	B
<silence>	2257	B
<silence>	2257	A
okay so what do you think about us getting involved in the Middle East	2257	A
oh i don't think we did really either	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
well that's that's true yeah	2257	A
the uh the- the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and	2257	A
that really hurt the uh the people- uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
uh-huh	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
well do you think that um by uh going over there and doing what we did that uh it's going to give us a chance for peace over there	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah that kind of	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
well that's	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean	2257	A
isn't it logical that just any of the- that you can solve differences like that	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
so you	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
so you think it comes down to education or or something like that	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
 i suppose that's probably true	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
no	2257	A
oh	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah because_1 yeah i guess the uh you kind of think about the good things and not about the bad	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
right right	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
right	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
well isn't it also though based on religion i mean isn't that a a real powerful	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum well don't- don't you think though that uh because of religion it just enhances the differences uh of the tribes and makes it so that it's that much harder to get along	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
right right	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
	2257	A
that's true	2257	A
well since there's not going to be peace over there don't you think like getting involved as we have	2257	A
that that's going to mean that we're going to be involved from now on and so any war that breaks out we're going to have to be in the middle of it	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
it doesn't seem that way does it	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
 yeah i know	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah that's probably true	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
true they want the- the gas guzzlers yeah	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
 didn't it though	2257	A
yeah i- i got to agree with you there i think that does get a lot a lot of good there	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
hum United States right	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
let's say i'd have to say overall that the the war was was beneficial to the United States with with the change in attitudes and all that you know all that stuff i mean it's	2257	A
people think better about uh the US now	2257	A
and that's really going to i think eventually come back and and help with overall business standards i mean people are going um take more pride in their work and things like that i think it's going to really help out overall	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
that's right	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
oh yeah he had some excellent military people	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
 i- i was	2257	A
the person i was impressed with most i mean i- i really you know Colin Powell and and General Schwartzkopf they're military people but i really didn't know that Cheney was as military minded as he is i mean	2257	A
that's right i well he was what uh a Senator from Utah or something like that i can't remember where	2257	A
yeah and see i don't know that and it well- you know i was real impressed with his handling of this i know that	2257	A
oh yeah	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
 i don't think very many people are	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah there was uh there was a lot of talk about the idea that the even the uh Iraqis themselves the people wished we would have done that uh	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah well unless they finally do take care of it themselves but you know you kind of have to wonder whether it's going to be any better with uh you know depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or uh or the Kurds in power but uh you know	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
well that's true too yeah	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum yeah that's true	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
yeah especially the cost of that and- and uh uh the attitudes of the soldiers i mean they're there they- i think they could handle it better but if they came back and then had to turn around and go the attitudes would be just horrible	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
 yeah that's probably true	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
um-hum	2257	A
<silence>	2257	A
	2257	A
so do you think it's you do think it's a good idea for us to have uh	2257	A
well since you live close i don't know if you know um about what Lewisville's doing with recycling are you familiar with any of that	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
um	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
yeah i you know i read you know when they first started doing that in the paper and i read about that i was just praying that that you know that would be in our area because we've been recycling for quite sometime and	2264	A
 you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to Almetco you know which is a real pain so if they would come up with curbside recycling that would be	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
 well now have they moved them_1 behind Wal-Mart oh gosh	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
oh well that's really nice to know because we were doing the same thing because to take it to Almetco you have to take it when they're open you know which is always a real pain	2264	A
and so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart's parking lot we thought oh this is great and we started taking it up there and then all the sudden it disappeared you know i didn't realize	2264	A
 and we're going oh no there's our goes our recycling place well that's really nice to find out that it's behind there	2264	A
 well we pretty much do um uh plastic milk cartons and um um	2264	A
um newspapers i couldn't even think of what you call them_1 plastic milk cartons and newspapers and- and cans and glass i guess is the is really the four things that we do	2264	A
uh yeah yeah	2264	A
and really i think that's about that's- that's really about it is there anything- anyplace else that really takes anything other than that that you know of	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
oh really	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
i know i know we're kind of the same way and- you know at- at first i don't know about you at first it was a real	2264	A
it was a real hassle and i'm going are we really gonna do this but you kind of get i guess into a little routine you know and it just becomes- kind of is automatic now to to throw different things in different places you know	2264	A
so i've just got you know we have a a pantry- pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there you know and we just kind of dump things in each one as you know as we get them_1 so	2264	A
	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
oh really	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
yeah yeah	2264	A
yeah	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
oh well that'll be good	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
sure yeah let somebody get something out of it yeah that's true	2264	A
yeah yeah ha-ha well i was kind of hoping with you know- do you work for TI	2264	A
no	2264	A
yeah there was a uh that TI's got this this organization called TAD which is TIers Against Drugs	2264	A
and you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and uh you know just what you'd buy out of the machines and drink here and there's crushers out in all of the hallways you know and they're and that's and they use the money from that to fund this	2264	A
TIers Against Drugs program it's you know TI doesn't give them_1 any money all everything is made from that	2264	A
and they had talked about having a thing where like one Saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know	2264	A
and i'm kind of like you i wish they would do that because so at least i knew somebody you know was getting the money out of it you know that it- was gonna use it for good so	2264	A
	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
 sounds like you have a little one just like i do	2264	A
yeah mine was two in December well it was good to talk to you	2264	A
<silence>	2264	A
oh do they really curbside pick up i really hope they do that in Lewisville it'd make it a lot easier on all of us	2264	A
okay talk to you later bye-bye	2264	A
	2264	A
<silence>	2264	B
well i know that um we have some relatives that live um like around the Deanne area in there i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
no what i'll do recycle because we a there is some bins like behind Wal-Mart that take some things	2264	B
yeah because_1 i finally asked because we you know we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them_1 and they had it in front of Wal-Mart and i ask in Wal-Mart and they said they moved it just behind	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
um-hum	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
 yeah	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
yeah-	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
like aluminum cans or yeah that's about what we do too	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
well i guess um down in um kind of in North Dallas there's a place that'll take almost anything but	2264	B
	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
yeah	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
yeah i don't- think those milk cartons take up so much room yeah	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
 yeah	2264	B
no but i guess we kind of we started recycling after we moved here about a year and a half ago and- we were using baby food and there was just so many baby food jars that	2264	B
that's kind of what started it and plus some of our neighbors were doing it and- you know so when i found out some places to take it	2264	B
and- and like um they also take some things at um the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there and i know that they're gonna use you know the money for that to build some kind of um	2264	B
multipurpose field and that type of thing with put lights and stuff you know so you know if i'm not gonna get the money from aluminum i would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound to do something with you know	2264	B
	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
 no i don't a friend of mine told me about this program is the reason i-	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
yeah	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
<b_aside> what's the matter sweetie you need to wash your hands maybe Paw-Paw can help you sure <e_aside> sorry	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
she's uh she'll be two in July	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
so	2264	B
<silence>	2264	B
well it was nice talking- to you i know that they've started over in Richardson where my dad lives they pick up newspapers i think no so yeah	2264	B
yeah well it- okay bye-bye	2264	B
	2264	B
yes Jack have you had your car repaired lately	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
have you had your automobile repaired	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
was this a mechanical hitch	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
so you didn't have there was no welding involved	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
oh	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh	2297	A
	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
yeah yeah i know i've got a a similar problem i used to work uh believe it or not repairing cars about uh twenty years ago	2297	A
and uh didn't think of anything about doing my own repair work and uh i about twenty years ago i i got a real job	2297	A
and i've been doing it ever since and i've been away from it for so long now when i decided to do something to my car i couldn't uh my first experience was uh try to do something with the uh the exhaust system on my car	2297	A
uh try to work out in the driveway it's kind of cool outside no lifts so you had to work with a car jacked up and up up on blocks	2297	A
uh pulling the pipes apart not having the right equipment uh because i knew what right equipment i needed because i used to work in a garage i didn't have any pipe spreaders or chisels uh designed to do that	2297	A
and it would take me two or three times longer than it normally would to to you know to get the professional to do it	2297	A
so i started so i started taking my car to the garage and uh i had a little squeak	2297	A
in fact it was about a year ago uh when i applied my foot on the brakes and i i been experiencing this squeak for quite a while	2297	A
so i stopped at one of these speedy muffler places uh	2297	A
so they have them_1 look at my wheel bearing because my wheel bearing needed grease	2297	A
and uh after waiting a half an hour to get on the lift i uh	2297	A
i was there and he pulled the first wheel off the one that i said that was squeaking and uh he said the bearing looks good	2297	A
so he pulled the other left front wheel off and he says uh i think i've got a problem and he says i said what's that he says your brakes are no good	2297	A
so he says- says want me to pull the back off i says no and so he pulled them_1 off anyway	2297	A
	2297	A
so then he says uh-huh you need you need brakes on the front you need brakes on the back	2297	A
i said well jeez you know i only stopped here to get a wheel bearing put in and i says i didn't uh you know i didn't have uh	2297	A
slightest idea i needed brakes so he says well	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
um-hum	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
um-hum	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
oh so it-	2297	A
it was a continuous squeal	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
right what the	2297	A
yeah this is evidently it's a new technology that uh that came about after i worked in my garage twenty years ago they didn't have such a thing but what what they've got now is like a little metal tab	2297	A
that uh that that that is designed to squeak	2297	A
when uh you know before the thing that they used to use was uh if once your let me see once the pad reached the level of the rivet head	2297	A
then that was time to to change your brakes unfortunately you couldn't see it until you pulled the wheel off	2297	A
so they they needed an audible method of defining when brakes were needed so they came up with that	2297	A
but i didn't finish telling you my story- uh my story that was only the beginning	2297	A
after he pulled all my four wheels off he says you're going to need new brakes so uh	2297	A
i says well what is that going to cost so he said well let me figure it out so he says uh well probably a couple hundred dollars	2297	A
so i says well i said that isn't too bad i said why don't you go ahead and do it so he i says but give me give me an estimate- a written estimate so he went around and he says well your back drum is no good i can't turn it down because it's oversize	2297	A
and you need new this and you need new that and he come up with a bill of seven hundred and forty eight dollars i've got a i've got a Cadillac	2297	A
 so	2297	A
so i says no i says i don't want to do it i said put it back together he says i don't know if i can	2297	A
 so i'm stuck over there i've got my car all apart and he's telling me he doesn't know if he can put it back together again i says well i came in here with a car with four wheels on i said i'm going to leave with four wheels	2297	A
so he says well why do you want to put it all back together again if you know you need brakes because_1 he showed me and i did in fact need brakes	2297	A
and i was going to do it myself and i just you know it it i shuddered uh because_1 everytime i try to work on my car lately- lately i don't have all the right tools and it ends up taking my twice as long	2297	A
so then he turned around and says i can give you a fifteen or ten percent discount if you do it now so i says okay so it ended up costing me almost six hundred almost seven hundred dollars	2297	A
for that complete brake and i just stopped for a squeak	2297	A
	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
the the place that i've been going to because i own a Cadillac you can't go to a garage you have to go to a dealer	2297	A
uh they charge thirty six to forty five dollars an hour and uh i had trouble with my fan on my blower	2297	A
it my my high speed wouldn't would not work my low speed blower would work but my high speed wouldn't	2297	A
so i says i'm not even going to i'm not even going to try it i said i'm going to take it right down there and tell the guy to put it in so i uh i went down i picked it up	2297	A
picked up the car when it was all done and i says well how much is it	2297	A
and the part came to i don't know twenty seven dollars and the labor came to something- something like fifteen dollars	2297	A
which is unusual because i never get out of that place for for less than two hundred so i'm saying to myself if he only charged me fifteen dollars that meant that he only worked on it for about twenty minutes	2297	A
and and i said just for the heck of it i want to open up the the hood to see what he worked on	2297	A
honest to God the the blower a a two year old could have changed it it was right on top i didn't even bother looking because inside my car looks like uh	2297	A
all tubes and wires and vacuums and hoses and and this blower is sitting right on top of everything and it was only two little screws holding it down	2297	A
so it took him about five minutes and he charged me a half an hour's worth of labor to to put	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
no evidently they uh they gave me a half hour minimum is what they charged me	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
yes i am	2297	A
can you tell by the accent	2297	A
	2297	A
garage	2297	A

to visit- visit Dallas and put some presentations down there and everytime i open my mouth	2297	A
people	2297	A
people people want to hear me say the word car	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
Attleboro Massachusetts	2297	A
i'm in the uh TI field-	2297	A
uh-huh i well i gathered that	2297	A
for some reason the people down in Dallas don't know that they also have an accent- an accent	2297	A
	2297	A
well you are but you do have a southern southern uh drawl i can i can tell that you're from uh the southern uh	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
oh so you've got a you you don't have a strong uh a strong accent the people that i were talking to the guy that i was talking to last night had uh a a stronger accent	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh oh so that helped	2297	A
<silence>	2297	A
uh-huh	2297	A

uh-huh	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
uh-oh	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
uh-huh	2297	B

uh-huh	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B

<silence>	2297	B
Mississippi	2297	B
and uh driving at that time i had this uh little Ford Escort	2297	B
which tows like a little baby behind a a motor home	2297	B
and i dearly loved it for that	2297	B
but uh i was out driving around looking at the sights uh well this is Vicksburg uh so i was looking at the the Civil War battleground	2297	B
and i developed this hellacious squealing just like you did only the	2297	B
mine sounded like uh it was coming from the depth of hell somewhere that kind that kind of a squeal	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
where yes and it was more outstanding when i turned in one direction rather than the other	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
yes	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
yeah	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B

uh-huh	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
oh boy	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
well i guess i was pretty lucky it only ended up costing me eighty- eighty five dollars but of course all i got was the front brakes	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
uh-huh	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
um-hum	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B

<silence>	2297	B
oh for pete's sake	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B

<silence>	2297	B
uh-huh	2297	B
say are you from Boston by any chance	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B

<silence>	2297	B
oh oh well i'm down in i'm in Dallas	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
well i shouldn't have because_1 i'm a damn Yankee myself	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
well	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
i've spent better than half my life in Tennessee North Carolina and Florida	2297	B
Louisiana Mississippi	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
um well twenty five years ago i was in the radio business commercial radio	2297	B
and well i was a DJ at the time and i i really worked on losing- losing my New York accent	2297	B
and uh i like to think i managed to stay away from it but you're right i do catch myself every once in a while	2297	B
talk along with that Southern accent every once in a while	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
okay so uh	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
oh oh yeah that i do and i've been	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
uh-huh	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
well i do it on my motor home because uh it's it means uh if if i take it somewhere to do it	2297	B
i have to take it to an RV dealer	2297	B
because local stations just aren't big enough to handle a motor home	2297	B
and uh so i do the the i change the oil myself but something i have been putting off for too long now is flushing out the radiator	2297	B
that i've got to do this weekend i've been promising and promising to do it	2297	B
<silence>	2297	B
oh yes definitely i had uh oh a few years ago i had a	2297	B
a Ford 150 pickup	2297	B
and i didn't take very good care of it at all i i i must admit	2297	B
uh red facedly i must admit that i didn't	2297	B
take care of the basics	2297	B
and i never did drain i didn't even drain the radiator every winter i'd check it	2297	B
and uh well it was several years many years had gone	2297	B
	2255	A
do you have a favorite basketball team	2255	A
the Lakers LA	2255	A
okay	2255	A
uh how they doing this year i'm not i haven't even been following them very much	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
i know they lost recently to the Bucks in Milwaukee	2255	A
that's that's where i'm from so	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Mavericks do have problems without Roy Tarpley they're not going anywhere	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
they do they always seem to get the talent there	2255	A
well they i think yeah i think Milwaukee got lucky because Magic Johnson sat out that game	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
do you think the Lakers can win the championship this year	2255	A
	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
you don't like Mike Dunleavy	2255	A
yeah he didn't they didn't let him have quite the the flair that uh Mike Riley had	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
well Dunleavy's a good coach though he was	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
well-	2255	A
he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
no i'm pretty familiar with with Dunleavy because_1 he was an assistant at Milwaukee	2255	A
uh yeah and he uh when- when they had uh injury problems with some of their major players uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played	2255	A
they they signed him to a ten day contract and uh he became a player even though he's assistant coach	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
the guy knows basketball i think he'll do all right for the Lakers	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
oh yeah oh yeah it's fun i'm watching the i'm i'm busy watching the NC double A tournament uh the past couple weeks	2255	A
and the NIT semifinals are on tonight	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh	2255	A
yeah right	2255	A
so are any of those teams of interest to you	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
oh yeah well they're they're just	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Larry Johnson	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
right well they're just head and shoulders above everybody else this year	2255	A
oh yeah they're they're so much better than anybody else it's uh that they're prohibitive favorites in winning all their games	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
right	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
well it's it's just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now Arkansas played thirty four games this year that's almost half of a pro season	2255	A
it's too many for students	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
right	2255	A
they're talking tonight about this NIT game with Stanford and Massachusetts that the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing basketball	2255	A
they have an honor system there where they would- they had uh three hours to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess by- they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished	2255	A
send them out by Federal Express and fax machine	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah it's incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament	2255	A
but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles from- from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in	2255	A
	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yep	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
i don't know so do you think uh you think Vegas is going to win the finals then	2255	A
i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Kansas is a real surprise i didn't expect them to get that far	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh they beat Arkansas yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Arkansas just uh they had a rough second half	2255	A
they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers	2255	A
yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore	2255	A
and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because_1 they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won the- the championship	2255	A
but i don't think they	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah well they they are just that much better they've got so many stars	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old they've got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
guys that are playing for long time uh they're playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Duke's team is nineteen years old	2255	A
Vegas the average age is over twenty two so they've got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now	2255	A
but they're going to lose all those guys at the end of the season they're going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmon's a senior and Larry Johnson i don't think i think he's uh is he a senior or junior	2255	A
i'm not Larry Johnson i think he's coming out this year	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh and Anderson Hunt all their uh their best players i think are graduating	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
well maybe not graduating but at least they'll be entering the the pro draft	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
oh yeah for sure yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
George Akals and Stacy Augmon	2255	A
Anderson Hunt	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh well i wouldn't say that i- i think	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
their coach may not be there i think Jerry Tarkenyon may be headed for the pros	2255	A
there's some talk that he may be uh coaching for the LA Clippers next year	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
they have a great amount of talent but they just have poor coaching i think	2255	A
they've got some great players on that team	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
i just think that yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh well Houston's playing really well lately	2255	A
last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
sure	2255	A
i think Houston's playing really good ball lately	2255	A
ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem he added the H to the front	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
well uh i can understand that it's uh i don't know why he dropped it in the first place but uh	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
sure	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
so who do you think's going to win the NBA this year	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Portland- Portland's looking awfully good	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Isiah Thomas Detroit	2255	A
Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
they'll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Chicago's playing really good ball with Michael Jordan	2255	A
and i think they finally put things together	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah well Chicago they they've been struggling last couple of years and they've had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the play-offs	2255	A
i think this year they're going to really uh show some talent	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
oh yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
it's not true they have a good supporting cast	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
Boston Celtics right	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
yeah i don't think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year	2255	A
they've got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old	2255	A
he's still playing center	2255	A
and uh Larry Bird's talking about retirement here i guess in another year	2255	A
yeah	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
but they're bringing in some good young players too	2255	A
which is good	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
i'm i've always favored Milwaukee being from that area and they've made some good moves in personnel but i don't see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year	2255	A
they have to get by Detroit and Chicago i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
but yeah i don't think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
uh-huh	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
right	2255	A
<silence>	2255	A
	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
Lakers	2255	B
	2255	B
yes i'm from LA	2255	B
	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
they're okay they're not um out of anything yet they're still hanging in there	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
 yeah	2255	B
yeah that's about the i like the Lakers and uh Mavericks are okay but they they got a lot of problems	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
and see i don't think they should build up on one person like Chicago with you know with Michael Air Jordan and that's not good Lakers got so many different players	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
um-hum i guess that's why i like them	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
yep i'm not too much of a basketball fan but you know i watch a lot- i watch different games like	2255	B
play-off games and stuff like that	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
no	2255	B
 not since they're coach is gone	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
no	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
huh-uh Mike Riley was it and that's	2255	B
he's good it's just he's not he's not Riley and i think that's the biggest problem is eventually they're going to have to figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other	2255	B
huh-uh would uh	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
oh was he	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
oh my goodness	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
huh-uh	2255	B
that's all right then	2255	B
huh	2255	B
boy you you like basketball though don't you	2255	B
	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
uh-huh	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah see now i watch the the Final Four	2255	B
once it gets down to like the Final Four	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
UNLV i like them	2255	B
i guess because_1 well that guy is from Dallas that's probably about the only thing yeah that's it that's the only reason why i don't know anybody else	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
are they really	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
but then you know just like that man said in this final- in these in the NCAA- whatever it is the little play-off games they play so many sometimes i do think it's going to be more it's luck and ambition you know	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
see that's	2255	B
that's too many games	2255	B
you know and and then they supposed to be studying	2255	B
you know	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
uh-huh	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
are you serious	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
uh-huh	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
hum	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
i don't think that's good	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
uh-huh	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah i don't think that's i don't think that's good	2255	B
that and then you know the laptop that's how i guess they really stuck it on a disk	2255	B
the teacher you know with no answers and they could take it like that and then just print it out in fax and it would be okay because_1 you can put it on a you know on diskette	2255	B
and just have them take it but then who's helping them_1	2255	B
see now that's	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yep	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
in that the other one that upset- that was an upset was Kansas last night	2255	B
when they	2255	B
yeah i didn't think they was going to beat that team i don't remember the team but they shouldn't have beat them_1	2255	B
i didn't uh yeah that that i like i like Arkansas	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
and it was like they just died or something you know	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
	2255	B
huh-uh and	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
that's it	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
um-hum see now that's the that's the thing now	2255	B
everybody's waiting for UNLV	2255	B
and see if Kansas if Kansas-	2255	B
yeah but then you know it could be what if they're not hitting that night or they're low or anything and see i- i feel like the college you know it's kids- it's still kids	2255	B
so	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
they just take them_1 out	2255	B
think that	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
that'd be all right	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
um-hum	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
um-hum	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
who	2255	B
he's	2255	B
yeah he's coming out in the pros this year	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
um-hum	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
i don't- i think i think he's going to move i think he'll probably go he now Larry Johnson is definitely going to the pros	2255	B
and uh	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
there's some more that i don't i can't think of their names God my girlfriend she she gets me because_1 i can describe them_1 go you know that guy you know and she'll name them_1 for me	2255	B
yeah now they'll come out in the pros	2255	B
they'll come out	2255	B
they're half they're team is going to be gone now and see that's another thing for next year with UNLV they're not going to have no team	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
well i mean as far as the the top players you know like the ones they have this year you know	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah he's nice	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
uh the Clippers that's another team and i don't think they've ever done anything	2255	B
but um no coaching	2255	B
yeah that's all right	2255	B
that be all right between them and	2255	B
then there's that uh let's see i like the Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks i like them too	2255	B
i like probably uh the Houston Rockets shocked me the the- i think it was last year when they uh	2255	B
last- last year they beat LA last year	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
because_1 i know my sister's in LA see and she calls me up and tells me well LA's going to come down there and beat up on Texas you know and i said yeah and so when they came down so what happened it took them a long time they beat them_1	2255	B
but it was like four out of the three seven games they had to play the seven games	2255	B
for the for the thing you know just to beat them_1 so it was like one game over	2255	B
uh-huh	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
 his attitude i don't know i don't know them people	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
i don't either	2255	B
if it was his name he should have just kept it i you know that's your name that's your name	2255	B
	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
hopefully i don't think the Lakers are going to win but i think um oh what's his	2255	B
no not Portland what's that team with the little guy with- uh the no Isiah	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
i don't know i think they'll go i think they'll they're good but they're not great but i think they'll	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
but i think that's what usually happens to them	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
um-hum	2255	B
yeah they did good last night last night they had like a hundred and something to eighty	2255	B
so they they was playing real good last night	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
i think also because_1 they done took some of the pressure off of him	2255	B
you know they because_1 they always think it's all him and see there's not you know	2255	B
that's not good but i mean everybody's always looking at him that's just like Larry Bird and um uh God Larry Bird what team does he play for Celtics	2255	B
yeah see because_1 they put a lot on Larry Bird	2255	B
um-hum	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
hum-um	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yep	2255	B
	2255	B
well he's out i mean he's hurt this year	2255	B
so you know you never know	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
um-hum	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yeah	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
yep if they get by Detroit i think they can get by by- uh Atlanta	2255	B
<silence>	2255	B
well that's what i meant yeah they get by Chicago hey can get by Atlanta	2255	B
it would it if you can beat Chicago Atlanta shouldn't be that much different	2255	B
you just slow down Isiah Thomas and Atlanta is um	2255	B
they got what-	2255	B
all right now we used to be big time campers but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
well when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know we- we went like twenty or thirty at a time we took uh just our little tents	2248	A
and we did it that way then when we started having children we bought a camper you know and we did it that way	2248	A
so we've always enjoyed camping	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
yes- yes now we have friends with a van and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van you know	2248	A
like one night and the next night they'll stay at the motel you know or something like that and they enjoy it	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
	2248	A
oh yeah	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
oh	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
yes yes	2248	A
oh but now i enjoy it every once in a while i mean it's not something i'd want to do real often i'm a sissy i either want to do it in the fall or spring you know	2248	A
yes	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
well not really because usually it's when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so it's usually like that	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
just about	2248	A
just about	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
oh it really is it really is also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family	2248	A
it's a lot easier then	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
oh uh-huh	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
yes	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
oh i'd like to go anywhere you know i just like to go	2248	A
i really do	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
no not really not that much um we've been well	2248	A
we've been to Wyoming you know and Kentucky and Montana and you know places like that but usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long	2248	A
you know like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on	2248	A
but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i'd rather just go to Galveston	2248	A
you know	2248	A
yes yes	2248	A
yes	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
it is my children really enjoys it they really do but by the time we really get a chance to it's July you know and it's so hot	2248	A
and our camper does- doesn't have an air conditioner	2248	A
yeah it's one of those pop-ups i'm sure you could put one in probably but we hadn't did that	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
yes we all enjoy camping and they're you know they're in like R As and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also	2248	A
at least their daddy goes with them i don't when they do that but	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
that really is	2248	A
well how old is your boys your children	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
oh yes yeah yes	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
it really is mine's eleven and eight	2248	A
so they really enjoy it too	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
 yeah	2248	A
yeah yes yes	2248	A
oh but i have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp	2248	A
you know they love to go camping they could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because there's nothing holding them back but i'm just not that involved in it	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
yeah	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
oh	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
me i haven't really as far as entertainment i don't know what you would do if	2248	A
you know but i guess	2248	A
my entertainment's television i guess	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
<silence>	2248	A
oh i don't either	2248	A
uh-huh	2248	A
yes but they probably live in a city also don't they	2248	A
well see we're in a real small county area and you know that makes a big difference	2248	A
because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know	2248	A
that makes a difference	2248	A
it was nice talking to you too and we'll probably be talking to you again okay okay bye-bye	2248	A
	2248	A
	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh what type of camping did you do	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
oh uh-huh	2248	B
oh how neat	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh well i know i have um i just have a tent and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent and then i bought a van and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
right	2248	B
yeah	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
yes i don't i don't think i'm a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping all the bugs and stuff but i i try	2248	B
 but but i try you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy	2248	B
and it's all over him the poor thing you know so there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at	2248	B
oh shoot	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
yeah	2248	B
right right definitely when it's cool well have you done much camping around Texas	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
yeah well have you camped all over the United States	2248	B
wow see now i haven't so that i bet you that's an experience there	2248	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
right right	2248	B
well i know my parents like to camp a lot and they uh they've been going to Gulf Shores Alabama	2248	B
and uh which is really really neat they said they've got the white beaches and the sand and it's not real populated so they can they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean and uh from what i understand from them it's really really pretty there	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2248	B
well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
right right	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
yeah	2248	B
 oh yeah yeah yeah rent a beach house or something yeah that's that's my idea of camping	2248	B
but we're uh we're getting more into it and we've done uh we've done quite a bit and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can um so that's good you know they're they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
right	2248	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
oh yeah	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
uh-huh uh-huh yeah well that's really neat	2248	B
well	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
yeah yeah oh that's neat that's really neat	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
well i well i have um a son that's uh going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter that's thirteen	2248	B
so they're they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too	2248	B
and that's that's really neat	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
yeah yeah	2248	B
yeah i i agree with you they like to get out there and but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to to get out there and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy and it got all into his eye and it was really swollen and uh so they had to give him shots and everything so	2248	B
oh well maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular	2248	B
	2248	B
trees or what bushes whatever they are	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
no now i like to go out like several times a year but not on a on the regular basis i have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season uh and and i just couldn't do that you know	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
yeah yeah	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
just getting away	2248	B
yeah right right see i see they just want to get away	2248	B
but every Friday night they'll go home you know straight from work and they'll pack up and you know and then they'll leave and i'm just going you know by Friday night i just want to crash you know and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot so	2248	B
but anyway that's their life	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
yeah yeah that's true	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
uh-huh	2248	B
now that's true that's true	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
yeah that's true	2248	B
well it was nice talking with you okay	2248	B
<silence>	2248	B
okay well take care bye-bye	2248	B
	2248	B
	2235	B
okay	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
hi	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um yeah sure um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back	2235	B
if you can't pay for it you shouldn't have it period	2235	B
and	2235	B
that's just	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
well	2235	B
	2235	B
i don't have a master charge thank you	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
right but that's the problem see as our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own	2235	B
or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt	2235	B
then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight	2235	B
if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us	2235	B
that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford	2235	B
which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds	2235	B
but i feel like the generation after us would- oh man it i would be so good	2235	B
it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what- what they could afford to save to buy	2235	B
and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
uh-huh	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans	2235	B
and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it	2235	B
i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it	2235	B
and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans	2235	B
don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just	2235	B
so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know	2235	B
but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy	2235	B
including new vans and so	2235	B
so i guess i've seen it done and i know you can do it you know	2235	B
but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van	2235	B
and that's where Americans don't like to do it and so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
what	2235	B
	2235	B
	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
	2235	B
i know	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
yeah	2235	B
i know	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
uh-huh	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
yeah that is true	2235	B
because_1 i always think the mail never comes on these days and you're like well what is it	2235	B
you don't even know it's a holiday	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
but isn't that federal in the federal budget	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
but isn't it part of our income- it's not part of our taxes	2235	B
it's not	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
	2235	B
	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
those stamps are valuable now	2235	B
	2235	B
that's funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that	2235	B
that overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because	2235	B
i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to	2235	B
be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order	2235	B
and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money system- we already have new bills printed for US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean i've seen them_1	2235	B
and so i know that the long-term vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh	2235	B
but i'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know	2235	B
that's a lot of power for one or two people to have	2235	B
and so um i guess because_1 i- i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like	2235	B
you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i don't think Americans are willing to do it	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
i don't i don't feel we should loan them money if i- i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things	2235	B
and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesn't work are they gonna	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
but it's not but it's not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that	2235	B
i mean our our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them	2235	B
and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation but because we're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back	2235	B
it be do you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but	2235	B
because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things	2235	B
our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back but because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks	2235	B
use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation	2235	B
you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations	2235	B
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them	2235	B
and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know	2235	B
do you understand	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
yeah	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
yeah	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
	2235	B
right long what- long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know you can't alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
that's my opinion my opinion's the latter	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
i know but what's yours do you agree or do you disagree or i mean what do you think long term	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
yeah	2235	B
yeah um	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
yeah different	2235	B
ethnic groups	2235	B
yeah i know what you're saying	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
um-hum	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
uh-huh	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
uh-huh	2235	B
<silence>	2235	B
<silence>	2235	A
hi	2235	A
okay you wanna start	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans	2235	A
uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something	2235	A
master charge	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
uh true but uh uh uh without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles or they wouldn't be able to own a house	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
well now i agree and uh i agree with you one hundred percent i'm just taking the other side just so we'll have a discussion	2235	A
here	2235	A
uh but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
um-hum	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
uh-huh	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget	2235	A
very simple	2235	A
just take all these civil service employees and and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them_1 like Columbus Day President's Day	2235	A
i mean they get- they get all these days off now give them_1	2235	A
what a a week i think we here at TI get a total of eleven a year	2235	A
and that's about uh three or four less than civil servants get	2235	A
now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
well now don't forget the mail is something else again that has nothing they're not civil servant people	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
no no they have their own budget they go by	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
no you know that's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
you know i could	2235	A
i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
yeah they probably hey i ought to go looking through some of my old mail	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments	2235	A
how do you feel about that	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a give- a giveaway	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
no that that's true i- i understand that France still owes us money from World War I	2235	A
and uh World War II debts have never been repaid i think the US just wrote them all off	2235	A
and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that Polish debt here uh last week	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the Poland debts	2235	A
to help them	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
uh-huh well uh i've got to respect your opinion you have some uh solid ideas	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
well i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world	2235	A
uh that's	2235	A
asking for trouble people are too different	2235	A
i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the US and find tremendous differences between the peoples they have their own ideas how things should be run	2235	A
so therefore i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world there's too many societies involved uh the language barriers	2235	A
uh oh sure they- somebody said years ago well let's make it English uh an international	2235	A
uh language	2235	A
that's a big laugh we can't even make English a a national language here in our country	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
we've got too many uh uh	2235	A
uh immigrants	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
a well yes yeah but uh	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
my grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century	2235	A
<silence>	2235	A
and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger	2235	A
he uh was supposed to serve some time well he did serve his time in in the uh the militia	2235	A
and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you	2235	A
<silence>	2274	B
um-hum	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
they have socialized socialized health care	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
how do they pay for it how is it financed	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
oh	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
well i feel like something needs to be done here and i'm definitely in favor of the government i just think medical- you know medical costs have as i've seen over the years just go up and up and up and already just this year	2274	B
you know i'm a single parent and you know i have to pay for medical insurance and	2274	B
it's just outrageous my son you know has got allergies and he's got this and he's got that and he broke his arm i mean and you know it's a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there	2274	B
and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
or they can't yeah they just can't	2274	B
yeah i've been in positions before where i've had to wait a few days you know to have a prescription filled because i just didn't have it	2274	B
and i don't think that that's fair i don't think it's fair you know to the kids and and to the people that are sick and i know that you know	2274	B
every city has you know their you know their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those	2274	B
i've been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and still- wait you know it's hard to see a doctor from what i've heard	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
well yeah there's a lot of people that um you know don't work	2274	B
you know and don't have it you know any other means they've and so they either don't- again don't have it or they have to take it out themselves and pay an arm and a leg for it	2274	B
you know i'm thinking of you know i just did my tax return for the last year you know if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your income	2274	B
you know it's worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first year we reached that mark	2274	B
where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just	2274	B
you know i just did it it's very frustrating a hot topic for me	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
um-hum	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
um-hum	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
oh at least at least	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
oh it's out it's outrageous and then a lot of companies you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but	2274	B
you know that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and i	2274	B
 know people at the end of the year you know that have had that money checked out regularly and then it's like well let's see i guess i could go get a new of glasses you know	2274	B
you know get a big crown done you know things like that but	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
i know	2274	B
yeah um do you think that that that the insurance and all they've got in Europe does it cover dental or is it just medical	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
um-hum	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
what motivates people to go into medicine are the doctors you know how how do the doctors	2274	B
	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
they do so they're getting paid	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
i yeah i don't know either	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
yeah right	2274	B
i- i don't know it's going to be hard to switch i think that we're going eventually end up end up that way though i just don't see how we can yeah i think it'll take	2274	B
i agree it'll take a while but i think we have to be headed	2274	B
have to be headed in that direction	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
nice talking to you too	2274	B
<silence>	2274	B
first person from not from Texas that i've talked to	2274	B
you're the first person not from Texas that i've talked to	2274	B
	2274	B
okay you too bye-bye	2274	B
	2274	B
	2274	A
um regarding health care it's funny because i have a sister who lives in Europe and in Europe that's the way it is health care is just	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
right exactly and um the the interesting thing is that it seems that they don't even think about it	2274	A
it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
well um i think the government subsidizes most of it but i- i believe that that again just people are taxed	2274	A
a little bit more but it's just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there	2274	A
you know what do you feel about it	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
yes	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
the twenty percent	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
and and the sad part is that people to to you know combat this they just won't go to the doctor or they won't fill their prescriptions	2274	A
i mean that you know that's the alternative	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
i know	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
oh yeah um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
oh you did	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
wow	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
i know well and well you know you're not the only one though um i'm in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits	2274	A
i thought great you know can't get any better and then slowly each year you know now they're down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up	2274	A
but um you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i- i don't have kids so i'm not worrying about family coverage	2274	A
but once you get into family coverage it's crazy	2274	A
it- it's just crazy	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
yes	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
right they have a hundred dollars to spend in December i know what you mean	2274	A
yeah we do that too we're fortunate though this year somehow how it's only March and we've already used up our entire amount i don't know if that's good or bad	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
i don't know um	2274	A
i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know	2274	A
major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
i don't know i really don't know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status	2274	A
 i don't know i guess they're getting paid for it one way or another and and i would imagine although i don't know maybe there still are private practices there i don't know	2274	A
i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean	2274	A
health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know especially- that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills	2274	A
you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now	2274	A
yeah	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they won't jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know let's increase it from there	2274	A
i don't know but	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
it'll take a while maybe our grandchildren will know it	2274	A
yeah	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
um-hum	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
well it was nice talking to you yeah maybe one day we'll all have health care	2274	A
<silence>	2274	A
it's what	2274	A
oh i know like i said everyone's been in from Texas all righty well take care okay bye-bye	2274	A
	2274	A
<silence>	2294	A
okay Jim um can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
yeah	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
well you've you've got a point there but um do you think one appeal is is too stringent	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
okay	2294	A
now um what do you think about about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
 yeah well i kind of think we're too lenient number one	2294	A
now i work in Massachusetts but i live in Rhode Island so the the legislature just come out and said that because of what with	2294	A
treating the prisoners so-called brutally because uh the state prison's overcrowded we have to release them_1	2294	A
so they took the offenders with the the minor crimes and they let them_1 go they didn't have to serve the rest of their term and which is absolutely incredible	2294	A
um	2294	A
i think number one my opinion is that the judges are too lenient	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
but yet you get some of the jury trials and and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person	2294	A
they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well that's it you know we're going to kill you	2294	A
so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now	2294	A
and the other thing is i'm not sure about Texas but like in Rhode Island if someone breaks into your home	2294	A
you have to do your utmost to leave so you can't cause a confrontation with that person you can't shoot him you can't do anything with him i'm not sure what Texas is	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
yeah it's	2294	A
yeah and ours	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
yeah and see in our case it's you have to you have to exit you have to leave and if you have to leave your home to get away from this individual that's what you should do	2294	A
so	2294	A
what choice have you got	2294	A
you know as far as as far as	2294	A
our laws go up here	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
yeah you're fading-	2294	A
you're fading away Jim	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
huh	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
that doesn't make any	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
right	2294	A
right	2294	A
and so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time when when the act was was performed but he knows he's going to go back and do the same thing over again	2294	A
you know when he's straight so so-called	2294	A
so people like that any one i believe you if you murder someone i believe in an eye for an eye	2294	A
and i think probably uh	2294	A
uh maybe the majority of the people do at least the people that uh that i talk to	2294	A
you go out there and you kill somebody you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot somebody	2294	A
you deserve to be killed also	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
right	2294	A
right um you're subject to one appeal i- i kind of don't agree with you on that i think probably you should have at least two appeals	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
yeah	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
that's yeah right common sense has to has to set in some place it's just like uh uh organized crime now they know all these people they know that the the leaders of organized crime and all that sort of stuff why can't they do something about it	2294	A
because they can't if they if they tape something they can't they can't bring it into the court as as evidence	2294	A
and they know	2294	A
they just had this uh i don't know if it's been in your newspapers but um the guy that got out of prison here to go to a mafia um swearing in ceremony	2294	A
and they got uh	2294	A
uh somebody and i'm not sure who who it was what organization- what law enforcement agency	2294	A
they got a movable bug a a a court order for a movable bug which means that you can take it any place and put it any where	2294	A
and now they're contesting that movable bug because they didn't state that they were going to put it in this particular home where this meeting took place so there's a technicality there but they know outright	2294	A
that these people are murderers and whatever else you got and yet they're not going to let that evidence in you know as admissible evidence in court	2294	A
so that has to be looked at too um i don't know who they're protecting they're not protecting the innocent that's for sure	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
that's true that's true um self-preservation of the species i guess right	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
well the	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
you're kidding	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
because of because of what because of overcrowding or	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
huh	2294	A
now the pendulum's going to swing	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
more and more people	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
yeah because you look at the statistics now and i'm sure it's in your your newspapers just like it is in ours that	2294	A
every major city now the increase of crime is is escalating i mean there are more look at the look at the people there are being shot now	2294	A
i mean every day there's there's dozens of dozens of people across the nation they just get blown away for no reason you know stray bullets or	2294	A
California they were going out there and they were shooting and they get these guys and they don't do anything with them so i kind of i kind of agree with you i'm kind of you still in the in the uh prison system	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
how do you like it	2294	A
well	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
that's incredible	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
do you uh you carry a firearm in when you're in there	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
nothing	2294	A
not even a uh uh billy club or	2294	A
huh	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
what's the purpose of that so they can't take it	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
yeah well i don't know so you going to make a career out of it	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
oh okay is it uh was it uh civil service	2294	A
<silence>	2294	A
<silence>	2294	B
uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're going to give the man the death sentence	2294	B
go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence	2294	B
if you're going to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it	2294	B
plus costing the taxpayers twenty five thousand dollars a year just to keep the guy locked up	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
no	2294	B
i do not think one appeal is everybody's entitled to one appeal	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state we've got a very weird situation going on we're under federal supervision	2294	B
and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i don't for first time offenders everybody's entitled to screw up once we'll give them the early release credits we'll give them the good time credits we'll give them the early parole	2294	B
second trip down whether it's for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day	2294	B
third trip down this is where	2294	B
my views on it goes way far beyond what the law states	2294	B
third trip down if it's for the same offense or for a totally different one this individual has proven that he does not want to conform to the rules of society so you kill him period end of story	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
uh Texas has got it rigged to where i can't shoot- the guy can enter my property and i can't shoot him but once he's physically inside my house	2294	B
uh the law reads to where you can defend yourself if you feel your life is being threatened yeah at two o'clock in the morning if somebody's in my living room i feel real threatened so i'm going to come out with guns blazing	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
well the the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures they've swung so far away from	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
there there is no such thing as justice in this	2294	B
country anymore we only have situation ethics	2294	B
i said yeah the guy robs the liquor store and yeah he shot the owner but he was under the influence of narcotics	2294	B
that that should make absolute zero difference you shot the guy you get the death penalty period	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
but that's what's got our system bogged down so bad now they've appealed everything to where if they've got one typographical error where in their	2294	B
in one line instead of spelling	2294	B
they've got one word misspelled i mean it's a very minor clerical error they couldn't tell they they'll appeal the hell out of that and that just throws another wrench and it takes two years to work an appeal	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
uh-huh	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
since so people that came up with the laws that made all these loopholes and technicalities take a look at your congressmen and senators you'll find that the vast majority of them are practicing lawyers	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
that's it what they don't realize the time is coming and i see it coming over the horizon that the majority of American people- people are getting fed up with their BS and are demanding- are going to demand real justice instead of this	2294	B
in Texas- in Texas we're getting to a point where a guy gets a fifteen year sentence he's going to serve fifteen months and he's out	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
one month for one year actually assigned	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
overcrowding	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
overcrowding	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
we've gone too far to the left it's fixing to come back hard right	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
yeah i've been with them for about four years now	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
all things considered i'd rather be a cop on the street because_1 once i walk inside the gates the inmates have more rights than i do	2294	B
say an inmate swings at me or he's raised his fist threateningly toward me i've got to let him hit me before i can hit him back to be justified have it called what they call a justified use of force	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
thank uh federal judge named William Wayne Justice	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
no in inside the gate i do not carry any weapon at all	2294	B
nothing	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
so they can't take it away from you	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
i seriously doubt it	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
oh it it it all boiled down to when the opening for this came up it was the best deal going it was paying so much more money than what i was making before i couldn't turn it down	2294	B
<silence>	2294	B
uh actually really- really	2294	B
<silence>	2259	A
well how how do you feel about the immigration laws	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
yeah well i'm not real sure why i got this topic because i don't think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
 oh	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
uh-huh	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
hum	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
no that doesn't make a whole of lot sense	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
um-hum	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
	2259	A
yeah	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
well uh my uh my family is from uh Europe from well from England and Ireland	2259	A
and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years	2259	A
so i don't have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all they were all born here	2259	A
so i don't have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws i don't because i don't	2259	A
i don't have any personal feelings about them_1 and i i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
uh-huh	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
uh-huh	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
yeah i- i	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
well i agree with that i- i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted	2259	A
uh not only would would the United States become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly	2259	A
i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
i was not aware aware of that	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
uh-huh	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
yeah	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
i think so	2259	A
well i've enjoyed talking to you	2259	A
okay thanks	2259	A
bye-bye	2259	A
<silence>	2259	A
<silence>	2259	B
at currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries um	2259	B
i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern Europe for example	2259	B
uh particularly the uh the Jewish uh uh people from Russia i think we could permit more of them in than we have uh permitted in the last uh several years	2259	B
and i think we have uh uh	2259	B
too much restriction on the uh on the Orientals also	2259	B
but of course that's just my opinion	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
um-hum	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
um-hum	2259	B
well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly South American countries and uh	2259	B
there is no uh uh i have nothing of course against uh the uh the South Americans or uh	2259	B
or Hispanics in that sense but i think we uh are more restrictive of the um so called eastern uh European countries than we uh	2259	B
	2259	B
and uh	2259	B
so i think uh you know the um embargo we placed on the uh on the Russian Jews although we spent- of uh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we	2259	B
simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds so	2259	B
i do not quite go along with that but	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
no	2259	B
and i still think you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so	2259	B
i'm a little touchy every now and then about that	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
um-hum	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
oh my	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
uh-huh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
	2259	B
although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country um	2259	B
i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um	2259	B
some quotas of course my family and i again again that was you know my uh grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas so they had to wait uh	2259	B
you know in uh certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over	2259	B
so you know but uh	2259	B
i think unrestricted immigration i think is not uh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
is not best uh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
um-hum well you know there's another aspect of this too they're also uh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
well yes there are were some uh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
regulations over i don't know whether they're laws passed or or whatever they're called uh just recently where	2259	B
uh	2259	B
people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from immigration AIDS is one for example and uh recently uh	2259	B
tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also	2259	B
so i think in in some- some aspect- some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense but uh	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
i think we should be a little more circumspect about it	2259	B
again my opinion	2259	B
<silence>	2259	B
think we've talked long enough	2259	B
 all right	2259	B
or i- i- i have talked long enough	2259	B
	2259	B
	2259	B
thank you	2259	B
good-bye	2259	B
	2259	B
<silence>	2253	B
oh i just read for escape well i mean it's	2253	B
yes it's that's simple i read to escape and i don't read any Parents magazines either so	2253	B
well i just finished just i just finished one last night a great book	2253	B
it it's very a typical for my reading though but a great book one called The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien	2253	B
and it's uh God i don't know if i would call it	2253	B
a collection of Vietnam war stories or if i'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories	2253	B
strange book beautifully written	2253	B
just beautifully written	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
yeah a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier so he considered himself to be you know a a true Vietnam soldier	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
yeah so what's the latest one you've read	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
uh-huh	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
i have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
have you are you a Civil War buff at all	2253	B
because_1 i finished one	2253	B
i think this is like two years ago	2253	B
and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy women's novels set in the Civil War John Jakes one and the novel didn't do that much for me but boy the period of time was fascinating	2253	B
so i then read	2253	B
was it Battle Cry of Freedom	2253	B
yeah i think it was Battle Cry of Freedom it's kind of like a historical compendium	2253	B
of the Civil War and it's not a story of the Civil War it's a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that led	2253	B
to of the events that brought about the Civil War and it's fascinating because i had always you know have been raised on this you know Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War	2253	B
 there was a lot more to it than that as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
oh yeah	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
um-hum	2253	B
well you know what else really surprised me now i'm married to a native Texan and i'm not	2253	B
uh	2253	B
 yeah i'm glad you put it that way and i have two native Texan children too my husband is always you know talked about Texas being a uh rebel state and oh my God all this Civil War pride	2253	B
i kept waiting for where's some reference to this God damn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War they might as well have not even	2253	B
been there you know they weren't a state and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know who's going to be going there and i keep telling my husband that and he keeps saying oh no i thought okay	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
oh i'll bet they did	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
well you know why they actually held them_1 off	2253	B
none of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar	2253	B
now you didn't hear me say that outside of um	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
yeah	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
boy don't tell that to a native Texan though i mean my God they fought and won the whole thing	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
ooh	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
that's a beautiful state that's a beautiful state see i was raised in the Midwest which you know hell we didn't even you know	2253	B
we didn't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was and besides you know if corn didn't grow there it didn't matter	2253	B
Iowa and Nebraska	2253	B
yep and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts so you know what does that make me an honorary Yankee or	2253	B
God knows what	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
 well then she's going to come out well rounded but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that i've really gotten into reading	2253	B
i think this is because the kids are getting to me	2253	B
is science fiction	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
well i've gone to the point where my husband my husband travels i get out like you know two or three books	2253	B
and i i'm trying to think of	2253	B
oh Isaac Asimov Robot series	2253	B
	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
you know i think i read Hawaii when i was about ten years old or so which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things and i still even then i was so so disgusted with it i- i tried to read	2253	B
i don't remember which other one it was whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller	2253	B
and i just i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more i thought i can't do this	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
yeah	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
no	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
 is that a big thick book	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
what the what the hell for why Kingsley Iowa	2253	B
oh okay	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
well	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
now that's one	2253	B
that's one i don't know see i had never really been into science fiction that much until uh	2253	B
somebody gave me Mist of Avalon probably about five or six years ago i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
well i loved that novel and then somebody said oh God this would have been even long ago because i was in Boston and it was raining all night and i had a hole in my roof and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and uh i was reading Dune	2253	B
which seeming rather ironic	2253	B
and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten gallon buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little Freeman Steel suits and	2253	B
i think that's probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that i've ever read and the movie was awful oh yes it was just terrible	2253	B
it was it was beyond	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
i don't know i just remember Sting was in it	2253	B
yeah and if you were trying to follow any type of uh	2253	B
plot it it total- even having read the book and i've read that book probably three times watching that movie i couldn't figure out what they were talking about	2253	B
at all	2253	B
i was real disappointed in that well i'll tell you another good book do you like scary things	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
have you	2253	B
that's true have you read The Silence of the Lambs	2253	B
ooh	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
well see i'm i'm debating whether or not i want to go see the movie after having read the book i mean the book is is chilling just chilling	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
then i won't tell you	2253	B
 it's just that if you're ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
that's the one yes	2253	B
<silence>	2253	B
yes because the character- the the character that is so horrible is another human being And you're just drawn into his	2253	B
 his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him	2253	B
that i mean	2253	B
no no This guy's smart and he's suave and he's all the characteristics- all the characteristics yeah all the characteristics	2253	B
yeah the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh	2253	A
uh i guess	2253	A
okay with two little kids i can understand that	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
oh	2253	A
what uh what kind of	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
hum	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
oh	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
by uh somebody who was there or	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah well any of the guys that were ground yes yeah i can imagine	2253	A
yeah well i tell you what i'm a kind of uh a history	2253	A
nut i'm trying to think back now i read an awful lot of uh	2253	A
periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference book and uh the last uh i'm embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i cannot	2253	A
right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the Michener uh Lone Star or the the Texas History Book	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
oh well i've had similar problems it does tend to to	2253	A
yeah as a matter of fact yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
uh-huh	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
uh-huh	2253	A
	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
uh-huh	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
uh-huh there was a lot more to it than that weren't there	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah well it was a political move it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern	2253	A
support because you know it was uh if you read it it only emancipated those who were in	2253	A
areas uh in rebellion against the United States all the other areas which would i think at that time would have included West Virginia and	2253	A
oh may have been Kentucky a few states you know that were not part of the South but still had slaves they didn't emancipate them	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
i've got the same problem	2253	A
	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
isn't isn't much there is there	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
they supplied some uh you know they were some groups	2253	A
uh the Vicksburg if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg the battleground at Vicksburg	2253	A
uh there's an area there where there was uh some Texas uh	2253	A
groups and they had an interesting time there	2253	A
and down there at Sabine Pass uh i can't think of the guy's name but he held off the	2253	A
you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union	2253	A
navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
 that could be it could be it	2253	A
	2253	A
and then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde you know over there on the Texas border you had a lot of	2253	A
of groups heading for Mexico and they were cut off at the pass more or less at Eagle Pass	2253	A
and they didn't get across the river there so they're the last and that was actually after the war was over but it was the last	2253	A
organized battle between the two units was in Texas so	2253	A
yeah Texas participation in the Civil War was uh minor at uh	2253	A
at best yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah well my wife's from Galveston so	2253	A
yeah Well i'm from New Mexico so you know i was	2253	A
	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
it sounds like Iowa or something	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
hum	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah on yeah	2253	A
oh well my sister's living in Illinois right now so	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
i've always kind of enjoyed it i- i used to read a lot more than i do now	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
i just turned around and looked at my brief at my briefcase my uh bookcase up here and i see Armageddon up there	2253	A
and uh the Shadow of Blooming Grove	2253	A
and Two Thousand and Ten and Grant Takes Command and The War in the Year oh Space gee that was the one i was trying to wade through was Space James Michener	2253	A
didn't get very far on that	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah it really the the books are kind of uh imposing to say the least	2253	A
no let's see here's one called Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of New Mexico now not too many people have read that one i don't think	2253	A
and there's The History of Yoakum County Texas there	2253	A
i've got uh	2253	A
yeah and i've got yeah and i've got a History of Kingsley Iowa	2253	A
well because_1 that's where my folks all came from and they had a centennial here awhile back	2253	A
i read the Grant Takes Command that was pretty good	2253	A
that was part of that trilogy that uh Bruce Canton did	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
sometimes it's awful hard some of those get very philosophical they can be in any setting	2253	A
they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting you know the	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
oh	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
uh-huh you're reading Dune	2253	A

yeah i'd i didn't see it but uh	2253	A

Patrick Stewart was in that i guess the guy that's on the new Star Trek series was in that thing uh	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
oh really	2253	A
uh	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um-hum	2253	A
couldn't	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um well- well some history books are pretty scary but yeah	2253	A
no somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen they didn't sleep all night	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
yeah i have no idea- i don't have the foggiest notion what it is about so	2253	A
okay yeah but	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
um-hum that's the one	2253	A
even better than Jaws and some of that	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
	2253	A
yeah	2253	A
<silence>	2253	A
oh	2253	A

so i am super whenever we go down to Galveston to the beach or something like that you know i look kind of stupid i'm out there in a T-shirt and everything else	2258	A
pretty much covered up but uh you know i'm never going to let my shoulders and back get sunburned again	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
um-hum	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
well it is March after all you know you're not supposed to worry about sunburn in March	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
	2258	A
that's right	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
well yeah i hope so yeah we're going to go to Lubbock they'll probably have another sandstorm out there you know	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
big Lubbock yeah are you a native type Planoite or you been here a while or	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
okay well well where did you come from originally	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
oh okay well i'm a Tech graduate so	2258	A
yeah i grew up over in New Mexico at Roswell	2258	A
and my wife is from Plains if you know where Plains is	2258	A
it's on the it's on the road where do you know where well you go south out of Lubbock down to Brownfield and then you like you're headed over toward Roswell Plains is right there	2258	A
uh about fifteen miles in from the New Mexico line	2258	A
so so yeah you talk of little towns in west Texas yeah i'm	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
okay yeah i know where Panhandle is that's north up there isn't it yeah	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
yeah i had a friend who lived in Dumas	2258	A
so	2258	A
yeah so anyway yeah we're kind of familiar with that part of the world now there's where the weather's interesting i think it's kind of dull around here compared to	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah my mother still lives in Lubbock and we talked to her the other day and they said Friday they had or Thursday or Friday they had a you know one of the world class sandstorms out there that happens every once in a while hadn't had one like that in a couple of years	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah i recall a {snirtstorm} out there one day where about this time of year that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in the air and then it snowed a little bit	2258	A
and uh	2258	A
i can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than i could in Lubbock but still anywhere out there it could happen	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah i we like i said i grew up in New Mexico we lived in Albuquerque- Karen and i both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and then i went to work for TI here	2258	A
and i came here in sixty nine and then seventy two they opened or seventy three they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock	2258	A
and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there	2258	A
ended up coming back but uh	2258	A
yeah the weather out there was uh-huh it it could get a little bit a little bit interesting now and again	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
uh-huh	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
well if you've been here for three years you didn't get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four	2258	A
oh wow that would have been six or seven years ago then	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
um-hum	2258	A
with the ice yeah	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
well the uh	2258	A
was it i guess it was three years ago that they had the real right before was it right before Christmas or	2258	A
where	2258	A
yeah- yeah got down to around zero somewhere and then warmed back up and killed everything off	2258	A
yeah that was that was bad news we're still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed them_1	2258	A
well they all come back from from the bottom	2258	A
so i'm getting kind of convinced that if something doesn't grow naturally here there's no sense in planting it because eventually you're going to lose it	2258	A
and you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now the native trees	2258	A
	2258	A
they're they know better they know better yeah	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
um-hum	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
um-hum	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
well you're just about there i think it's	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
um-hum	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
well we moved into this house it was a year old and the landscaping was {semi-in} but there was still a lot more to do	2258	A
and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know that's the best stuff in the world	2258	A
well i am somewhat less than enthused about that i've got some out here that's	2258	A
five six years old now and still doesn't look a whole lot different than the day that i put it in	2258	A
and then and i noticed that a lot of the garden well you know that Indian Hawthorne that didn't work out quite as well as we thought you know so now they're pushing something else	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
	2258	A
 plant yeah	2258	A
this uh photinia	2258	A
the red tipped photinia	2258	A
it seems to do pretty good we've got some here that's really taken off	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
um-hum	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
that and uh the little dwarf yaupon hollies you know they they seem to or just yaupons period seem to do all right	2258	A
we've got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and of course they're	2258	A
they weren't native to this particular spot but they seem to have done pretty good and	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
and uh	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah it's it's it's a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's doing because_1 right now is when it's dropping it's leaves	2258	A
and you go out there and look at your tree after a good windstorm and the thing is bare and you think oh no	2258	A
but you look look real close and there's all the little new leaves getting ready to come out so it holds it's leaves all winter then loses them in the spring	2258	A
that and that red what is it red oak	2258	A
we're thinking about putting one of those in	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
uh-huh	2258	A
well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that	2258	A
but most of the time that's the way that the native ones grow because they don't get the water they don't get the they're they're growing under bad conditions	2258	A
and uh if you bring one in and put it under good conditions they'll grow about as fast as any tree	2258	A
so yeah	2258	A
so anyway that's that was i guess he was talking about some of the other kinds of oaks i don't know	2258	A
whether the live uh live oaks is not really an oak i guess it's something	2258	A
oh	2258	A
yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because_1 it's got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it	2258	A
but uh i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and	2258	A
pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing they they'll grow a lot faster	2258	A
well i guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but that's	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
well are you with TI	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
how many these have you gotten very many of these calls at home	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
okay well i got the first one this evening that i had gotten at home i	2258	A
i'd made a couple at work	2258	A
you know but uh made- made several from work but i'd never uh i'd never gotten one yet i was just	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
yeah	2258	A
	2258	A
well	2258	A
 you know you'd think that this crazy system if you're going to talk about something about the weather they'd have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody	2258	A
	2258	A
yeah weather difference between east and west Plano	2258	A
	2258	A
clear across town	2258	A
<silence>	2258	A
well when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights	2258	A
you know it would be snowing up in our area and then the sun would be shining and it would be hot down in the	2258	A
downtown but uh that's not the way Plano works	2258	A
	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
well i tell you what it is it's warm where i'm at	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
uh west Plano	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
okay	2258	B
good deal well i tell you what uh yesterday i went out and played a little golf and uh i paid the price my neck got got burned to a crisp	2258	B
yeah	2258	B
but uh it was it was beautiful out	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
oh Lord	2258	B
	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
exactly	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
all covered up	2258	B
	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
well i tell you i'm the same way i tell you i- i knew better i should have put some sunscreen on uh yesterday but i don't know it felt so nice out	2258	B
well that's right that's right they shouldn't even be selling suntan lotion yet	2258	B
but uh hopefully uh you know it's going to stay warm for this weekend	2258	B
and uh	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
 so you're going to go to the big city of Lubbock huh yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
no i just been uh up here in Plano for about uh i guess close to three years now and uh	2258	B
i grew up in a small town right outside of Amarillo and uh then when i went to school at Tech there in Lubbock	2258	B
are you okay	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
i see	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
i've heard of Plains yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
i see okay	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
well no see i'm from a town named Panhandle	2258	B
yeah yeah	2258	B
right right right up there by Amarillo	2258	B
so uh	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
okay yeah on the other side of Amarillo yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
well that's right because_1 uh one day it'll be eighty and the next day it'll be about thirty below i tell you what and uh	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
oh Lord	2258	B
 that's one thing i do not miss about uh being in Lubbock i tell you	2258	B
because_1 one i i'll never forget uh one spring we had a real big dust storm come in and it started raining and uh it was like raining mud out there you know	2258	B
and uh	2258	B
	2258	B
oh Lord	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
that's exactly right i tell you	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
i see	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
oh it sure can because_1 uh the you never just you just can never tell what it's going to do	2258	B
and uh it's just hard to plan anything	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
uh that i did	2258	B
this	2258	B
okay	2258	B
yeah uh my first year down here uh uh that first winter i remembered TI was closed one one day uh	2258	B
that yeah with the ice but that uh that's about the worst worst winter i've been been through down here	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
yeah where it got just real real cold	2258	B
yeah	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
oh Lord	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
that's right because_1 the weather's going to get it exactly	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
that still don't have any leaves on them_1 yet that's right that's exactly right	2258	B
and uh my wife and i are going through that process now we just bought a house and we're trying to decide what we want to do with our landscaping and we still have to put a yard in	2258	B
and uh i'm still trying to decide when when the best time's going to be to do that so uh	2258	B
that's that's right you know i'd i'd like to get the yard in before all the rain start and uh you know if we could get it up a little bit and then the rain would really just help it	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
i see	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
oh is that right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
oh Neil Sperry hasn't been pushing that real hard and heavy here lately	2258	B
	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
 that's worth planting huh	2258	B
that's exactly right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
 red tipped bush yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
well yeah i- i- i know everybody in our neighborhood has has those bushes and uh	2258	B
like i say really seem to to do well	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right holley- yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
they sure have and that's a good tree it sort of stays green most of the year you know and	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
 the thing's dying	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
red oak yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
only thing is those things grow pretty slow you have to	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
oh is that right	2258	B
yeah	2258	B
so if you really fertilize it and	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
huh well that's surprising	2258	B
that's good to know	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
i think it's just by name yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
yeah huh	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
 at least we had a good conversation anyway yeah	2258	B
but uh	2258	B
yes i am yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
um probably about three i guess yeah	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
i see	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
gotten one at home huh yeah i've gotten about three i guess	2258	B
so	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
split it up a little bit	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
like New York or somewhere yeah that's right	2258	B
but uh	2258	B
 exactly	2258	B
clear across town but uh	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
right	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
	2258	B
<silence>	2258	B
	2236	B
good morning	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
yes	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
i- i always turn on the TV set and it seems like i catch that program in the last five minutes and	2236	B
i- i think it you know what i see is fascinating and i kind of enjoy it	2236	B
uh	2236	B
i've always had that hobby ever since i was a child	2236	B
and uh	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
i refuse to get involved because i never had space for a permanent layout	2236	B
and then here about five years ago we bought a big old house out in Oaktown Virginia	2236	B
and there was uh there was two basements	2236	B
there were two two separate furnace rooms	2236	B
and so i took the smaller furnace room and now it's full of trains	2236	B
	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
um	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
do you still have the uh train set	2236	B
he has it	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
um	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
put it on display	2236	B
well those uh the early Lionels can be quite valuable	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
yeah	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
well some of those around the war years were uh kind of difficult to get a hold of because_1 Lionel got involved in manufacturing a lot of uh uh war equipment	2236	B
and uh i think they almost discontinued production uh in	2236	B
nineteen forty two and forty three	2236	B
so some of the pre-war models are quite valuable	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
well i managed to sweet talk my brother out of uh his Lionel train set that uh dated back to about nineteen thirty three	2236	B
and uh he's kind of unhappy i've got it now	2236	B
 but i'm not going to give it back	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
and i had a uh	2236	B
post uh World War version of the Pennsylvania Electric uh GT1 locomotives	2236	B
and it happened to be one of the rare paint jobs	2236	B
so i understand that that locomotive is worth around seven hundred and fifty dollars now	2236	B
so it's it's sitting on display on top of my bookcase	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
yeah	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
um-hum	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
well Pennsylvania used to have uh some commercial displays	2236	B
there was one place that was halfway between Harrisburg and Allenstown Pennsylvania in a community called Midway which suggest it was halfway	2236	B
and uh	2236	B
they had a huge room which was probably uh forty feet wide and a hundred and forty feet long	2236	B
uh and the central portion of that room was occupied by one huge O gauge layout running uh uh Lionel train- and American Flyer trains	2236	B
and they had done a lot of work on that with uh scenery and buildings	2236	B
and they had trolleys running around and uh a lot of animation in there	2236	B
and uh it was in business for a long long time i don't know it it still maybe in business	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
yeah	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
yes uh i bought a uh Bristol thirty five five for my wife	2236	B
and we keep it on the Chesapeake Bay	2236	B
and uh starting next weekend i'm gonna have to go down and uh	2236	B
fill out for the summer season	2236	B
we have a cruise plan to sail from uh Solomon to Maryland up to Philadelphia this summer	2236	B
about a two week cruise and uh two or three lay days in Philadelphia	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
they have a a new waterfront uh marina in Philadelphia it isn't as developed as uh Water Side in Norfolk or the Baltimore uh waterfront	2236	B
but uh the marina is only about uh two or three blocks from the historic district	2236	B
so that's quite uh handy for our our youngsters we can take them_1 up and	2236	B
show them_1 Independence Hall the Liberty Bell and uh Franklin uh	2236	B
Franklin Square	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
um	2236	B
well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the British Virgins	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
uh that's uh that is almost an ideal sailing area uh	2236	B
if you have a little- even a little bit of experience uh i've seen a number of people go through a uh a cruising class in Annapolis	2236	B
where they might get uh maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing experience go down to uh uh British Tortolla	2236	B
and charter a boat for a week	2236	B
and they take it out and have a grand time	2236	B
uh it's fairly sheltered waters right there and uh	2236	B
you don't need any fancy navigation equipment because you can see all your destinations from one spot	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
um-hum	2236	B
uh i've been there several times uh the first trip uh	2236	B
we flew down and uh chartered a uh Morgan uh forty five	2236	B
and i had fun that then a few years later a guy i was racing with uh decided to take his boat down for a winter season	2236	B
and so i went offshore with him to uh Saint Thomas	2236	B
and then we cruised uh the American Virgins for a week before i flew home	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
i think the better sight seeing is in the uh British Virgins	2236	B
uh there's uh some very nice places like the bass which is a uh sort of a huge monolithic rocks that you can	2236	B
you can walk up the beach and into these uh enormous caverns that are partially submerged and you can wade in the pools and so forth very popular tourist spot	2236	B
uh	2236	B
the Bitter End is an excellent resort up in uh	2236	B
which is very easy to get into and there's some very nice reefs in that uh vicinity if you like snorkeling and uh scuba diving	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
and uh there are some very nice resort hotels so you can go in and uh enjoy a very classy dinner	2236	B
uh the Peter Island Yacht Club is uh extremely exclusive	2236	B
like uh i think they're probably charging five hundred dollars a day for a room now	2236	B
	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
and uh	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
it's there kind of a nice place to visit uh	2236	B
uh it's better being on a boat than being on land because uh your boat becomes your hotel your uh your dining room your taxi cab and uh everything else	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
well i'd recommend it	2236	B
<silence>	2236	B
<silence>	2236	A
uh hi	2236	A
you mentioned model railroading that uh i've been watching a program on the Public Broadcasting Station here uh about model railroading have you ever seen that	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
uh well it's been very interesting	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
uh-huh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
yeah	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
wow	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
	2236	A
 you should have taken the larger one huh	2236	A
well uh my uh brother had a Lionel train set he was a a bit older than i and	2236	A
so when i came along i was interested in uh fooling with the train and since he was- was past that stage why he didn't have any objections and	2236	A
uh in fact i started doing a layout uh in our garage at one time but	2236	A
	2236	A
but uh i've always enjoyed uh the train and	2236	A
you know fooling with it and all	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
he has it	2236	A
yeah i mean since it was his i couldn't very well keep it forever	2236	A
but uh actually i have had an idea not long ago uh hope to build another house some day and i was thinking i might uh incorporate some sort of a display space and ask him if he would	2236	A
let me put the train up you know not not as a working type of thing but just to	2236	A
uh-huh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
yeah i don't know what year his was bought but probably around	2236	A
nineteen forty forty two maybe i'm i'm just guessing but something like that i would think	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
uh-huh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
oh really	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
yeah i don't know i don't know if i don't know if he knows i know there's some uh booklets and things you know showing different models and stuff	2236	A
that are quite old that were with it but i don't know if they were original or if they were picked up you know in later years	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
um	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
	2236	A
yeah that's probably the way it goes sometimes	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
oh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
wow	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
	2236	A
it has a prominent spot huh	2236	A
well i think those things are neat and and as i say i watch that show and there are some uh really interesting museums around that uh have good displays and uh	2236	A
i said that well if i ever took a trip i you know might ignore some of these museums because a lot of them_1 are called childrens museums or toy museums and	2236	A
that wouldn't really catch my attention but if i knew that they had you know really good train layouts i would wanna go and see what they had	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
um	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
wow	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
huh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
it might be	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
well um you mentioned another hobby sailing do you have a sailboat	2236	A

<silence>	2236	A
right yeah	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
uh-huh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
yeah	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
right uh it just sound fascinating to me i would love to just go down i've always liked islands and water and that sort of thing anyway and um	2236	A
been on a couple of big cruise ships so uh you know i kind of had seen it from that point of view but i- i think i would like the sailboat	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
um	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
which do you think is best American or British Virgins	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
uh-huh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
uh-huh	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
yeah yeah that's neat	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
ooh	2236	A
	2236	A
that's getting up there	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
 everything	2236	A
yeah that's why i think it would be neat um	2236	A
<silence>	2236	A
sounds good	2236	A
	2236	A
	2256	B
um	2256	B
i think uh	2256	B
i like to listen to a program called Focus on the Family with Doctor James Dodson	2256	B
and from what i understand it's it's a new thing- good about families these days um	2256	B
especially spending time with one another i know if if i were to have children i would have trouble	2256	B
because i work and uh i have my dogs and i have a hard enough time spending time with them you know	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
uh-huh	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah really	2256	B
there's a lot of single parents too that are trying	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
and uh i'm not sure or i just wonder when we'll know what the effects of day care	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah i've heard that they they call them_1 uh that they say that they're more um	2256	B
creative that they're really just more rebellious	2256	B
from the day care	2256	B
because uh the people don't have the time to give that one-on-one attention	2256	B
and and i just wonder if maybe day uh the home schooling is going to come	2256	B
into more and more	2256	B
uh homes	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah because	2256	B
really if you have a good curriculum	2256	B
do you really need to have that certification	2256	B
of a teacher i taught- i taught school for a year and it was like	2256	B
whoops you know it's not for me	2256	B
because_1 i- i just don't have that discipline with children that uh you need for them to learn	2256	B
and uh i one day i was i like found myself	2256	B
uh telling them to write their spelling words a hundred times each and i just heard this comedian say that you know something that that's how you know you're a bad teacher	2256	B
	2256	B
and i was doing it just keep them occupied	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
 using it as a baby a babysitter	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
will numb you out	2256	B
well i've i've heard some uh there's a book out now called The Saturday Morning Mind Control	2256	B
and uh he raises some serious questions about why do they have these really a lot of money goes into the advertising for children's programs	2256	B
and yet uh children can't buy uh what's the deal	2256	B
 right	2256	B
	2256	B
i know it	2256	B
and boy the price of toys these days is ridiculous	2256	B
and they all have to have the same one you know	2256	B
say	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
	2256	B
	2256	B
i wonder how long that last	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
they didn't have a TV at all	2256	B
were they Pentecostal	2256	B
	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah they just	2256	B
 yeah	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah it is	2256	B
it's very good i think TV has really had some bad effects on all of us	2256	B
i've	2256	B
yeah yeah	2256	B
and you can't control it you you know it's the cable channels sometimes you can but	2256	B
boy the cable TV they'll just show anything	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
and that's coming right into your homes	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
uh-huh	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah yeah	2256	B
and there's a lot greater instance of uh children committing murders too isn't there	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
killing their parents and so forth they don't they see these things happening with no consequences	2256	B
you know	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah yeah like Double O Seven he's supposed to do it	2256	B
and it's okay	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
so i	2256	B
huh	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
no huh-uh because_1 i'm like forty three	2256	B
and so it's uh it's too late	2256	B
you know i wonder- sometimes wonder if i'll ever	2256	B
if i will regret it when i'm old but uh i just can't see myself as a parent	2256	B
you know it's	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
really are you married	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
<silence>	2256	B
yeah	2256	B
well i wish you the best	2256	B
it's good talking to you bye-bye	2256	B
	2256	B
<silence>	2256	A
uh-huh	2256	A
okay	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
	2256	A
yeah i i'm i'm pretty busy myself i'm in graduate school at State and i	2256	A
i can't see even having time for a pet let alone children	2256	A
but um	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah i think day care seems to be uh	2256	A
a real big issue	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah well actually there's been some studies that say it has some positive effects that the students- the the kids get you know exposure to other kids their age at an earlier time	2256	A
so they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group although they don't have real good uh role models	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
um-hum	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
i can i can see that happening	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
no	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
right	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
um-hum	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
	2256	A
um	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
i think another problem with the families uh	2256	A
is is the role of television	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
um i don't know it seems they're using it as a babysitter instead of a learning tool	2256	A
that really that really annoys me because i think i don't know i think my parents probably did that to me a little bit	2256	A
um	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah it's just	2256	A
go watch TV you know	2256	A
leave us alone	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
which	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
um-hum	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
oh yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah but they can they can whine and squeal and complain	2256	A
i'm watching Ninja Turtles	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah i could be	2256	A
	2256	A
	2256	A
i can see having kids and not letting them watch TV and making them toys out of wood	2256	A
	2256	A
here kid this is this is all you're getting	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
well i- i used to babysit for this family that didn't have a TV and their their kids turned out fine	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
they they had no TV	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
no	2256	A
i mean they had a nice stereo	2256	A
they listen to stereo they were into Michael Jackson	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
they just didn't watch him on TV	2256	A
which i thought was pretty neat	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
especially the the violence on it	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
	2256	A
i think TV can be good if if the family watches it together on they're watching good shows	2256	A
PBS or whatever i mean even some regular network TV is okay	2256	A
if the parents there and you know helps the students or help the the kids understand	2256	A
that yeah this that happened in the TV show but probably doesn't happen in real life	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
huh	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah you see it on TV The guy gets up and lives afterwards	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
you going to have kids in the future	2256	A
you going to have kids in the future	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
okay	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
uh-huh	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
yeah	2256	A
i'm still pretty young i'm twenty five but	2256	A
i don't know i don't see it for for at least a few years	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
no i'm single right now and i'm you know sorting things out which way i'm going to go with my life before i	2256	A
have kids you know career to to much into my career you know	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
okay well it's good talking to you	2256	A
all right bye-bye	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
	2256	A
<silence>	2256	A
	2293	A
okay	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
uh i don't know- there's a lot of air pollution	2293	A
um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it	2293	A
and with uh	2293	A
i guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um i'm north of Pittsburgh so	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
 yeah	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
yeah	2293	A
um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff and i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but	2293	A
the fine is nothing you know it's like nothing to them	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
yeah yeah	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
uh-huh	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
oh my God	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
uh-huh	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
uh yeah but	2293	A
i don't know what they can do to really prevent it you know like how can- what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait what you know i mean they fine the the industries but	2293	A
you know that doesn't seem to stop them there i don't know what else they can do	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
yeah i i yeah i just don't understand you know what else anyone can do about it i don't think it's something that people really think about either	2293	A
you know it's i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because_1 it's- it's doing a lot of damage but i it's something you know i don't think many people really think about it because it's nothing they i don't think we really have too much control over it	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
yeah exactly	2293	A
well i really don't know	2293	A
too much else about it	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
yeah	2293	A
yeah we have tried i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the mills that have	2293	A
i know- i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things but i mean every now and then it breaks you know and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or two till you can get it fixed and stuff	2293	A
so you know it's something we we have tried to help but yeah	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
um-hum	2293	A
<silence>	2293	A
 yeah okay well um-hum it's been nice talking to you yeah- okay bye-bye	2293	A
	2293	A
	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
well um discussing air pollution today i guess	2293	B
um	2293	B
uh well give me your first impressions	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
yeah	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
um-hum	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be	2293	B
but uh that stuff going on over there what- what uh what part of Pennsylvania are you in	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
okay- okay	2293	B
okay so it's it's- it's amazing too you know you- with that with the oil wells burning over there that's that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess	2293	B
but uh in Dallas we've got	2293	B
we've just uh	2293	B
brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas everybody loves their car and	2293	B
you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours that seems to be our biggest problem down here um	2293	B
you know there's uh	2293	B
there's a lot of industry around but uh it's not it's any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air it's typically water type situation	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
um-hum	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
yeah it's it's yeah like like two hours of output or something like that yeah that's true that's true	2293	B
yeah i uh i grew up in South Dakota so i was never i was never exposed to anything of of the of the sort um	2293	B
there were always the EPA people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results uh	2293	B
there was there was dust in the air during uh planting seasons and what not but uh that that was all we ever saw and then	2293	B
five years ago i i moved to Dallas and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about	2293	B
it uh	2293	B
it's it gets it's real depressing um	2293	B
in the morning sometime uh just you- you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh you- you can be on the road and still not see it	2293	B
 and uh	2293	B
you know i mean it's not uh i don't think Dallas is considered uh a a real bad	2293	B
place for for air pollution but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when it's when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color	2293	B
and uh it it's a little it's a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you're breathing	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
right	2293	B
right it's- it's	2293	B
that there really isn't a whole lot it's- it's one of those uh	2293	B
 it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and uh and every- you know every- every little bit does help i i do believe that	2293	B
um but i also believe that uh the earth is is a kind of a self-regulating system and uh it will clean itself up eventually	2293	B
it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess let- let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
um-hum	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
right and it's one of those things it's- it's- it's so hard to measure uh what- what what the damage is it's it's kind of like uh	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
oh i guess it's kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know it- it	2293	B
it it could go on for years and years until they they start- start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing it's doing some damage and and something's got to be done	2293	B
um there's you know there's a lot of things like that it- it it you can uh	2293	B
you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks but until it breaks you don't really know that there you were doing anything to it	2293	B
but uh	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
yeah well that's it you know i i i think we both agree it's it's one of those deals that uh i just think there's a lot of other problems right now and uh we've done a lot to take care of it	2293	B
and uh	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
oh sure	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
sure	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
oh there's no doubt about i don't know if you if you ever happened to see uh	2293	B
some of the like Twenty Twenty and what not about uh Romania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for twenty and thirty years	2293	B
and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted	2293	B
that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country and that's that's why i think that you know it's- it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh	2293	B
i think it's all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it's it's it's pretty much under control	2293	B
<silence>	2293	B
all righty	2293	B
well you bet	2293	B
bye	2293	B
	2293	B
	2243	A

<silence>	2243	A
hum i've got a uh	2243	A
i've got a few i don't know i don't know i don't even know if they're real but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins that somebody gave me as i when i was a kid	2243	A

<silence>	2243	A
um-hum	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
i keep meaning to do that everytime i go to a show i keep saying well i'll take them_1 with me and let somebody look at them_1	2243	A
they just they just feel phony you know they feel like they're made of lead or something	2243	A
and uh they don't have any sort of it's- it's got a it's got a like a picture on it	2243	A
but there's no uh inscriptions or or dates or anything else	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A

no sort of identifying marks or anything	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
no i don't no they're not they're it's it's too heavy for silver it's it's more like lead i think fairly soft	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
yeah i think they're fakes	2243	A
	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
probably i don't know where they got them_1 from they just came up gave me a whole bag of these things	2243	A

<silence>	2243	A
huh	2243	A
gosh all these years i've been thinking they were fakes maybe they're real	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
um-hum	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
um-hum	2243	A
	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
sounds like some of the coin dealers i know	2243	A
	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
	2243	A
right i used to be a coin dealer so i i i know i know those guys you know	2243	A
yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them_1 last night	2243	A
here's a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year	2243	A
	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
yeah that they they are gold they're just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value	2243	A
and amazingly enough you're you're into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon	2243	A
yeah	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
yeah still is	2243	A
yeah that's sort of like a cottage industry- industry over there	2243	A
uh and and there's some very specific things you can find you can even narrow- narrow it down to where it was made	2243	A
i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one	2243	A
and uh you you can almost tell the area	2243	A
somebody probably even knows the guy who made them_1	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
yeah well the yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them_1 sell these things	2243	A
and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit and that's always very difficult	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if it's an unscrupulous dealer he'll just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know it's yours	2243	A
course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but you'd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldn't	2243	A
fraud is very difficult to prove	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
because_1 you have to you have to show they knowingly did it	2243	A
and that's all he's got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin	2243	A
so you know it's his word against mine	2243	A
	2243	A
that's one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
um-hum	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
 yes	2243	A
yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh	2243	A
grading systems have changed over the last few years that's primarily what got me out of it	2243	A
they they kept changing the grading systems on coins	2243	A
and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection	2243	A
and you've graded it at the current grade and then the next year they've changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them_1	2243	A
you know it's just it it just got- it just got ludicrous after a while	2243	A
uh	2243	A
what- what- what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years	2243	A
and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them_1 as M S sixty five then by golly they're M S sixty five i don't care what you say	2243	A
and they'll keep them_1 until some fool comes along and buys them_1	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
at inflated prices	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
oh yeah yeah i mean it's really- it's it silly i mean i i i used to have people walk into my shop with um	2243	A
Indian head pennies you know	2243	A
and they say wow you know this is really old	2243	A
yeah well it's not worth anything	2243	A
	2243	A
	2243	A
and even- even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces	2243	A
and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars	2243	A
oh yeah yeah they're cheap they're super cheap	2243	A
um	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
several i mean it's- it's- it it's funny the way the business works because there're so many things that are enormously out priced	2243	A
um	2243	A
some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them_1 are are worth hundreds of dollars	2243	A
you know and and the coins themselves aren't worth very much at all face value basically	2243	A
uh	2243	A
and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else	2243	A
uh	2243	A
you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and it's traded for silver	2243	A
yeah	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
no it's it's more of a uh it's a commodity purchase really	2243	A
uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them_1 because_1 you do find some	2243	A
some uh	2243	A
nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books	2243	A
can fill a whole bunch of them_1	2243	A
with these uh with these bags	2243	A
uh especially you- you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves	2243	A
uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things	2243	A
i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um	2243	A
i'd give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced	2243	A
um but i used to go through- i i'd get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh about- about twelve bags of these things	2243	A
and i'd gone through all of them_1 and i found a couple of them_1 i found a nineteen O nine VDB	2243	A
and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce	2243	A
i found several good ones out of there	2243	A
<silence>	2243	A
people's giving it to me for two cents i uh that's okay	2243	A
turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars	2243	A
	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um basically i my preference is Arab	2243	B
coins	2243	B
and ancient coins	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh very interesting	2243	B
um over the years of course by uh my grandparents used to give me silver dollars so i've got a few of those tucked away but	2243	B
um your Greek and Roman coins might- you know if if they're um	2243	B
in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them_1 out and	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
that would be the Greek ones	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
okay because_1 i think most the Roman ones have	2243	B
right right so this	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
um it the are they silver or	2243	B
bronze	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh interesting	2243	B
	2243	B
did did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could have picked up some fakes pretty easily	2243	B
oh	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
gee that's	2243	B
 you might be sitting on a gold mine	2243	B
right um i don't know a lot about um Greek and Roman although i'm a member of an organization and that is the the primary interest of some ancient uh Numismatic Society Club	2243	B
and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek so every now and then we have a program so i've picked up a bit	2243	B
but um if it if they're really soft and very early they could be uh i think they call them_1 Lydian coins	2243	B
and um	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
	2243	B
right i don't uh you know i i guess they say that a lot of people in the in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes	2243	B
you know if you go to um uh a fight and then	2243	B
the people say oh look what i just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last night	2243	B
but um	2243	B
i think that's fairly recent phenomena probably	2243	B
	2243	B
now now they're supposed to they're supposed to be licensed and the um above board	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh i see	2243	B
oh and you made your own	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
	2243	B
was uh was the gold worth i mean was it really gold	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
right	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh really	2243	B
is that uh still- still true	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
wow	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
you mean make-	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh	2243	B
i suppose he he has to protect himself too so that somebody can't say	2243	B
you know when he's selling them that somebody else made it i mean it's	2243	B
so that he gets his own profits	2243	B
	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh i see otherwise the the buyer is	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
responsible- i mean responsible-	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
uh-huh	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
right	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
right right	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh that's interesting because i'm more interested in the research and i'm doing some dye link analyses of of these early coins from the	2243	B
six and seven hundreds and so- and so i'm not into the the buying and selling business	2243	B
um it sounds like i'm wise	2243	B
	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
right	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum i think that's that's the the hardest thing is that	2243	B
people who don't really know feel sometimes a sometimes- for example i know um you know the ancients better but	2243	B
because it's old they figure it's got to cost you know thousands of dollars-	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh	2243	B
	2243	B
right right	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh really i didn't know that	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh that	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
so basically if if someone isn't really interested in the coins it's not some an investment	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
oh	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
um-hum	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
right	2243	B
<silence>	2243	B
	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
anyway uh	2286	A
uh	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
well i did uh and i'm currently uh consulting now so i'm with this you know a smaller organization um so my benefits are	2286	A
pretty basic uh	2286	A
medical um	2286	A
i don't get any	2286	A
profit sharing and stuff like that so	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh	2286	A
is they are now offering	2286	A
you know flex flexible benefits	2286	A
where you have more control and allocate uh like you can	2286	A
uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can	2286	A
can do other things and uh	2286	A
they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits	2286	A
so it sounds like they're going to get very- more	2286	A
flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah are you single	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
okay uh	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
but	2286	A
no i i'm uh single i'm uh	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
never been married so	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
no i said i've never been married i'm- only i'm only twenty six so	2286	A
	2286	A
i still got a few years	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
and	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
so what are the most important benefits to you	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
uh-huh	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
the but the medical stuff itself uh	2286	A
the health plan you're with it only- it only covers fifty percent	2286	A
ouch	2286	A
that's the worst i've ever heard	2286	A
it's usually the eighty- basic eighty twenty	2286	A
besides your initial deductible that's what varies the most i guess uh	2286	A
ha um	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah co-payments type stuff	2286	A
yeah	2286	A
well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important	2286	A
uh coverage uh	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
of the you know you may not even go in	2286	A
to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously you- you know to get covered is important	2286	A
um	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
uh-huh how about any matching programs	2286	A
you ever	2286	A
you know what i mean where they contribute- contribute- contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a 401K	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
okay	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah	2286	A
but that that's a nice i think that's an important benefit	2286	A
uh i don't get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i	2286	A
didn't make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
so	2286	A
but uh	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
uh-huh	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
with an annuity	2286	A
yeah	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is	2286	A
when i was in school still	2286	A
i was down in Florida working and	2286	A
uh during- during the summer	2286	A
some how i got a hold of	2286	A
involved in a a marketing organization that marketed	2286	A
uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could	2286	A
and uh	2286	A
the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity- an annuity and uh	2286	A
they would uh you know analyze it	2286	A
the person's current policy and get a computerized- computerized you know statement of	2286	A
uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the the term life with annuity and the whole life	2286	A
was you know there's fairly big discrepancies- discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end	2286	A
and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but	2286	A
uh so i know a little about_1 uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but	2286	A
you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty thousands- or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to to	2286	A
yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you don't want to be a burden to anybody else uh	2286	A
and uh	2286	A
so i think	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah i mean i'm not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount uh and you know that's fine but uh	2286	A
uh you know to get that coverage and know that i'll get you know	2286	A
uh	2286	A
you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i haven't made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh	2286	A
see i've i've kind of moved around from my home originally and um my family's out in Florida now most of my family and i'm out here in Phoenix so	2286	A
but uh anyway as far as benefits um	2286	A
what else is important- important uh obviously i think uh	2286	A
a profit sharing is is uh	2286	A
is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term	2286	A
um	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah there's the smaller the the companies it's either	2286	A
the smaller company	2286	A
you- you- you're in to into the consulting side and they'll you'll finish up a project and you'll get the little bonus that type of thing	2286	A
um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing	2286	A
um	2286	A
but um most you know most medium or small	2286	A
probably don't	2286	A
do that much profit sharing	2286	A
and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
yeah they couldn't share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but	2286	A
i wasn't qualified- qualified for my first year something you know after	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
so	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
little over three years now	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
versus what	2286	A
<silence>	2286	A
	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
do you work for a large corporation- corporation	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
uh-huh	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
i uh i work with a medium size company and we don't have profit sharing but i would enjoy it since we uh it's a service based organization so	2286	B
it would be nice but	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
that would be nice	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
well people with families have different objectives than single people or no no i've got a family two children	2286	B
yeah	2286	B
alright do you have children are you single	2286	B
	2286	B
	2286	B
you are i	2286	B
oh you never have	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
	2286	B
we uh we've we just kind of started young in life but uh uh we uh my husband's still with the same company for ten years and as a result	2286	B
it has worked out so he's got a real nice benefit package	2286	B
but um	2286	B
it's uh it's nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
oh the hospitalization um	2286	B
is the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because it's a good well rounded program it's you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductible's reasonable	2286	B
i think it's three fifty a year for the family	2286	B
whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductible's i think five hundred a year	2286	B
and it costs a lot more i'm with a smaller company though	2286	B
so	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
that's right	2286	B
	2286	B
yeah it's not very good	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah yeah or you can go with a HMO you know Health Maintenance Organization where you pay a certain amount a month	2286	B
and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah co-payments that's what they are	2286	B
	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
um-hum	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
um-hum	2286	B
well if we uh one of our children is just is just turned two and her first	2286	B
eighteen months of life God well she had one operation she's been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean she's she's just expensive the other one wasn't nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those	2286	B
kind of sickly kids that has a lot of accidents	2286	B
	2286	B
no oh	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah yeah my husband's got that available that's great	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
 i think it's fifty percent up to four percent or maybe it's fifty percent up to eighty percent	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
i'm not exactly sure	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah that's great	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
	2286	B
yeah uh it it's nice we uh we we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is	2286	B
money that you can touch but it's tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in CD's and gets life it's a it's a term life policy also	2286	B
	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
uh-huh	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
really	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
uh-huh	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
uh-huh	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
until you get your dependents it just doesn't matter	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah right	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
right	2286	B
but as far as being able to really leave anything	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
are your family-	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
oh	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
i've never	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
i've	2286	B
my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn't and	2286	B
i'd really like it if my company did they turn quite a profit at times but	2286	B
it's not part of uh what's available so	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
um-hum	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
um-hum	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
 it didn't help any to share	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
yeah	2286	B
<silence>	2286	B
so have you been- have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah	2286	B
yeah	2286	B
at uh	2286	B
it uh quite a different world isn't it versus being- life before real world life in college-	2286	B
	2283	A
so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you or do you like to do it	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
well that's pretty good my my sister is very over zealous too she's got	2283	A
some really nice flowerbeds she puts a lot of time into them_1 this is my first year in a in a house where i	2283	A
thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff	2283	A
oh we i've always had crude ones at my father's but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house his house is more like a farmhouse its not on a main road	2283	A
my house is on a main road and it has nothing i mean nothing but uh what i do do is now i've always done it is at my father's house	2283	A
we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens i think we figured out total	2283	A
um	2283	A
this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre so we each have a third of an acre we do	2283	A
that's a lot	2283	A
	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah well it's my dad's and we've had it for over- he's been there for a long time so	2283	A
um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it but um they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy	2283	A
and we grow a lot of food	2283	A
uh i enjoy it	2283	A
um the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them_1 now that the	2283	A
and we've tilled them_1 so much but they're still	2283	A
we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing	2283	A
boy i wish this phone would stop screeching	2283	A
yes	2283	A
i'm trying i don't know if it's my phone	2283	A
this is bad it's not getting any better	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
oh okay	2283	A
i don't see i don't think my phone really does that	2283	A
but every time i have this phone is a little weird i mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah we we grow a lot of um the basic corn- corn potatoes	2283	A
she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow basic- corn potatoes and uh	2283	A
acorn squash are good winter keepers	2283	A
i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we just too much she she starts her own plants she plants a lot of tomatoes	2283	A
i let her do a lot of the planting and putting and i- i do a lot of the uh	2283	A
a lot of the the back- the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out	2283	A
beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know something	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
no it's just they don't like you to something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans i guess it's	2283	A
it it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other	2283	A
i mean she she reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
they	2283	A
yeah	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
oh that's really weird	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
i will put i've put my uh	2283	A
cucumbers are down at one end of the garden and like	2283	A
like i'll make an L shape i've put cantaloupe so they've been pretty close together	2283	A
but i don't think the vines have they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
oh	2283	A
i know	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
some something weird	2283	A
this year we didn't this last season it was it was too wet up here	2283	A
we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield was really bad because_1 of the water	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah- yeah	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah i- i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in	2283	A
with some topsoil	2283	A
and i'm going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i don't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something	2283	A
to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there i- i mean i guess it'd go for my flowers but	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering	2283	A
and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah but they put some kind of	2283	A
chemicals in there too	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah well i'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so i'm not going to not going- i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there	2283	A
but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground	2283	A
they don't	2283	A
it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush	2283	A
there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and	2283	A
said yep that's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush	2283	A
and he's cutting it down so that's all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding	2283	A
yep that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast	2283	A
some people uh would really like to have them_1 and then the people that do have them_1 they spread and they sprout all over their- their lawn	2283	A
so they're kind of a pain but you know people who don't have them_1 think they're great and people who do have them_1	2283	A
curse- curse	2283	A
another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard as a matter of fact there's three of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all	2283	A
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do	2283	A
	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them_1 they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a chain saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yeah because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin it's worse than a rose- a rose bush	2283	A
many times worse because_1 of course it's a tree	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
yep my uh dad used to work on them_1 so i don't think i'll have a problem my husband will have problem borrowing one	2283	A
 even	2283	A
<silence>	2283	A
well if that's not the problem it	2283	A
	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah well i um	2283	B
about a or just over a year ago i bought my	2283	B
my own house so this has been the first opportunity i've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden and uh you know and	2283	B
back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden i i'd hate it you know now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks and uh so i don't mind doing it so much anymore	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know i've got some uh bushes around the foundation- you know the foundation planting things like that and then there's some uh	2283	B
uh just some little flowerbeds and my mom grows she's an avid gardener and she starts her own stuff from seed now and uh	2283	B
she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the winter time and and starting them_1 uh	2283	B
she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them_1 all in her garden they have a huge yard and a huge house and so she brings them_1 up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras	2283	B
yeah	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
geez that's a that's more than	2283	B
that's more than than the property i have right here that you've got as a uh a garden that's amazing	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
right	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
oh geez	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
	2283	B
are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah i can't even hear what you're	2283	B
geez it's gone	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
well i- i don't know there was well whatever it was i- i couldn't- there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but um	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought it sounded well	2283	B
guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh uh doing this work but um	2283	B
yeah i mean that's a uh heck of a plot you must have uh a lot of different stuff you get out of it especially up in Vermont there you should have uh some really nice soil	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
um-hum	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
oh really is because_1 of like the cross pollination or	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
what	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
huh my mom uh	2283	B
put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers	2283	B
near each other once and they got cross pollinated by the bees	2283	B
and we ended up with these these like	2283	B
things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers	2283	B
and	2283	B
and yeah i mean there these were like some mutant	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
no it's just the like the bees and insects will do it	2283	B
um either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something	2283	B
yeah	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
oh well	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah when i uh	2283	B
my family used to live in Littleton Massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet	2283	B
backyard and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden so we trucked in uh	2283	B
i think it was seven	2283	B
what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards i think that's how they measure dirt but	2283	B
yeah seven yards of sand i got to shovel it all	2283	B
lots of fun	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
sure	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
right	2283	B
well it seems	2283	B
i've seen a lot of people use them_1 you know for flowerbeds but i don't know what whether they'd have creosote would	2283	B
do anything i mean	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
um-hum	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber	2283	B
oh that's right there's even there's bad chemicals in those too	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
alright	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
right	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
well it's not that you can see it a little better and it stands out	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
oh geez	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
rub up against the siding uh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
um-hum	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
 right	2283	B
right	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
uh-huh	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah because_1 it like i- i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
 give you room to get under it sure	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
yeah	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
hm	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
oh a chainsaw is always something very nice to have	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
	2283	B
then you got to get him to if he's going to do it you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it	2283	B
<silence>	2283	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh what a some subject uh oh	2267	B
it's it's i think it's almost as bad as religion talking to somebody like gun control with everybody has everybody has such ideas- ideas on it	2267	B
what what do- what do you feel about it	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
really are you from a big city	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh i no no kidding	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
uh-huh	2267	B
oh no no i	2267	B
no i i agree- i i solely agree- agree with you there i i i think i think automatic weapons	2267	B
is it's kind of ridiculous if there's not some kind of control on those	2267	B
because_1 there's no reason to have automatic i- i- i mean i mean deer hunters do not use automatic weapons you can't tell- you can't tell me that they're good for anything but but killing people	2267	B
but um but there there can't- you can't take gun you can't put total control because_1 the criminals- the the law abiding citizens won't turn will turn them_1 in and the criminals won't	2267	B
so it's it's a real messy subject it it it- it's there's just doesn't seem to be any good solution even though i do think that the uh	2267	B
the what's that seven day waiting period till they checkup on you until for- for buying a handgun is a is a really good idea that- that- that they're trying to push through Congress right now but uh	2267	B
i don't think they'll ever get it done	2267	B
i i just i really don't think they will you know and what what what uh what is going to hurt a waiting period so and you know for an FBI checkup to see if your not a mass murderer or something	2267	B
i don't think that's going to hurt anything	2267	B
no but	2267	B
but i i i agree with you um	2267	B
 because_1 i live uh just north of Dallas	2267	B
and this- this place in in Dallas is a mess we we moved out of Dallas last year	2267	B
uh my husband was transferred up here north of	2267	B
north of Dallas and to uh McKinney's a much smaller town and it's about oh forty five minutes north	2267	B
and uh Dallas is a mess i mean it just it's one of the worst- most- top crime	2267	B
i mean it may be no it was the number one crime	2267	B
yes last year	2267	B
yeah oh yeah it's it's it's- it's bad and- and well in certain parts of town	2267	B
bad	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
um-hum	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh	2267	B
nice	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh my that that's frightening that	2267	B
	2267	B
yeah yes	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
uh-huh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh it-	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yes lock the doors	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
 i don't care if you have a flat and you can-	2267	B
	2267	B
well when you get lost- there's a saying down here all roads lead to south Dallas when you get lost so	2267	B
	2267	B
 oh it's- it's- but it's uh well-	2267	B
it seems like the sirens just going all the time and you just uh people in the you'd- you'd every once in a while you'd hear what you	2267	B
was that a gun was that a gun	2267	B
	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
uh-huh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
 oh gosh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh ooh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah i we don't we don't own any guns but uh you know the temptation has been there you know	2267	B
to to go out and- and and and get something for for protection because_1 as much many break-ins and stuff as	2267	B
as there are i mean and and and they just don't stop with breaking in i mean usually they'll kill you you know for for twenty dollars in your pocket	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
so it's it's a it's it's a frightening situation	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
um-hum	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
uh-huh	2267	B
oh yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
of course	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
uh-huh oh yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
no	2267	B
 oh yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
ouch well yeah and a situation like that you know your your reflexes aren't good your senses aren't good i'd be	2267	B
you just- you- you- you just don't know what you'd do	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
uh-huh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
um-hum	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh my	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
that's true uh yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah being close- close as close as to it to a a situation as he is	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
i can i can see why he would and you know everybody ought to know how to how to shoot- how to shoot a gun and- and you know just you know just in case i never have	2267	B
but um my my husband's- uh husband's family has always had guns guns- uh hunting guns and plus antique plus antique weapons his his family uh uh	2267	B
collect some of antique ones he can load- he can shoot a muzzle loader real good but uh that- that but um	2267	B
um but i have a two year old and one on the way and uh that's that bothers- it bothers it would make me really nervous to have a gun in the house no matter	2267	B
where it- even- even if it was locked up it would really make me nervous	2267	B
oh	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh yes i would too	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
um-hum	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
i know i had- i had a college professor that went i went to school in in Missouri that's where we're from and he went to DC on a conference- for a a big conference he's a political science uh	2267	B
professor and he got kidnapped outside of a deli and was taken to taken to one to a a lovely part of town and stabbed and left for dead	2267	B
but uh he he recovered and you know i mean in amazing- amazing amounts of time and he was stabbed and was back before the semester- the the semester was over and he was	2267	B
that	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah well they robbed him- it it was they um robbed him it was it was a robbery	2267	B
they just wanted his money because_1 they could probably you know he was a college professor he looked you know like he had money and	2267	B
oh i- i mean they they really didn't worked- worked on him bad and it it just it was	2267	B
horrible	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yes	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
yeah	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
oh yes- oh yes well- and it's always children that it happens seems like	2267	B
<silence>	2267	B
uh	2267	B

oh really	2267	A
oh i didn't even know that	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
yeah well that's the way it is i think anywhere	2267	A
because like- like just in in DC like my fiance said like um he went to the doctors one time and it was located in DC and	2267	A
he had to park his car you know and his car was like two blocks away from the the clinic	2267	A
and the clinic had someone escort him to his car	2267	A
because_1 it got dark it was after sunset	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
yeah now that's- that's just ridiculous you know i mean that that's just	2267	A
	2267	A
we went through this one section and there were you know all the people standing on the corner and	2267	A
	2267	A
	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
is that's awful	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
uh-huh	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
yeah exactly like i would call my fiance and	2267	A
well he moved now so he's in a much nicer area but he lived like twenty minutes out of downtown DC	2267	A
and i would be talking to him on the phone	2267	A
and i could hear sirens and i could hear yelling and screaming and i'm like what's going on and he'd go to the window and he'd watch a policeman chase someone down the sidewalk	2267	A
and- and i'm just like and he and another thing was he lived on the ground floor of an apartment building and i was just like would you please move	2267	A
 just get out of there please i	2267	A
i mean i just don't think it's safe	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
yeah	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
exactly yeah	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
yeah well um i come from a large family and all my brothers hunt so we have hunting guns	2267	A
but they're always locked up at all times other than when they're being used and even whenever like you know like	2267	A
like if three of them are out hunting and there's still three guns left it's still locked you know it's locked all the time but	2267	A
	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
yeah but uh i know my um roommate	2267	A
she's from Latrobe and that's right out of Pittsburgh and her father is a state policeman	2267	A
and she has mace you know even to carry like i'm i'm at college so	2267	A
even for her when she goes out at night if her and i are out like if we walk to another building or something we always take the mace with us	2267	A
you- you know just because you know two girls walking but um her mom sells real state	2267	A
so her mom has a gun in her purse at all times	2267	A
because she has to pick up strangers that you know people that she's never met and take them to these houses and they're in her car	2267	A
so she he taught he has three daughters he taught all three daughters and his wife how to shoot	2267	A
and and i can very well see his point	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
yeah	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
uh-huh	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
but then and and you know and sometimes- you know i think that like	2267	A
when whenever i graduate i'll be moving to where my fiance is and i'll definitely want to have something if we're even	2267	A
a half hour away from DC i will want something you know but then again you know	2267	A
you would always want to keep it locked up or something then you know well then what's the sense of keeping it locked up because then if something would happen	2267	A
are you going to have time to actually go and unlock it and get- you know and you- you you hate keeping something laid out like that	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
oh my gosh	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
no	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
why would i i just don't people are sick for doing that	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
they just wanted his money	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
um-hum yeah	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
it's- it's- gun control- it's just always one of those iffy situations i think people should be allowed to protect themselves	2267	A
but then you know like you know so many families you know you don't want to let a gun out because accidents do happen	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
if- if	2267	A
um-hum	2267	A
um-hum yeah like i had a neighbor and uh	2267	A
he got shot in the stomach with a gun and to this day they declare that the gun was not loaded	2267	A
and i just cannot get that out of my mind now obviously the gun was loaded	2267	A
you know but to this day they swear the gun was not loaded	2267	A
and i'm just like well he has half his stomach missing	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
i i i'm just like well well then where did his stomach go you know i mean he survived you know but he was lucky that's all there was to it	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
uh-huh i i i just think it's an iffy situation	2267	A
<silence>	2267	A
<silence>	2287	B
yes we uh uh i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote	2287	B
uh did you get to vote at the last one	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
oh uh-huh yeah and sometimes the the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that uh they should be	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
right so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
 and it's it's they're and also they're fed up with the system and they say well why should i even vote	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
right	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
right the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it oh i know it the last gubernatorial race was oh that was awful	2287	B
but uh so i don't know i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh	2287	B
few years go	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
yeah i think well it's it's definitely a problem and i think it could get worse	2287	B
you know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote	2287	B
and then uh you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um-hum	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
right uh yeah we can get uh	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
yes	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um-hum	2287	B
yeah and uh who's the other guy LaRouche- uh LaRouche LaRouche- uh	2287	B
that uh is sort of the uh	2287	B
socialist not socialist but communist- uh uh he's so off the wall that uh he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and uh but he's got he's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe	2287	B
yeah Lyndon LaRouche that's it	2287	B
and uh so yeah	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um-hum	2287	B
right if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that	2287	B
they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guy's got everything together you know i like what he says you know it'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him	2287	B
and uh you know i think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because_1 because_1 uh the guy did get elected correct that's what i thought	2287	B
and uh	2287	B
so you know it uh but you know they can always fool us you know they might do a good job	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um-hum	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
oh yeah	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism	2287	B
and uh	2287	B
i know here you know you don't have to have any reason you can just go and vote	2287	B
and uh the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks uh the hours are good and it they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays	2287	B
and so you- we've got plenty of time to go uh because_1 uh down here in in Houston it's uh	2287	B
the lines are long	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
so uh but uh	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
uh-huh	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line	2287	B
and uh you know that vote's just as good as you know the one on election day	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um-hum yeah	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um i've yeah i've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the	2287	B
of the Republican party and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
the not the ballots but uh	2287	B
my mind has gone blank i've been wrestling with a child all evening uh	2287	B
what- uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh	2287	B
you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and uh you know on and on and on and uh it's it's interesting	2287	B
but	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
huh um-hum	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
uh right and uh there for a while that would that works we've uh	2287	B
i i know i have uh i'll stick to uh to uh you know sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy	2287	B
but uh if it uh gets down between two then i'll i'll vote for the party if i know you know something about the other guy or you know they're both just as bad then i'll say well	2287	B
i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party and um	2287	B
but yeah you know that's not uh the best way but	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
right- right but it gets to the point where i mean you've got to	2287	B
have the time- find the time also to read- read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
right or what you've heard on TV which i think is just outrageous i i don't agree with how the uh media handles elections	2287	B
i you know i'm i'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day	2287	B
they break it out it's just- it's just- ridiculous	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
um-hum it really could and uh	2287	B
uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could	2287	B
hamper the uh outcome of an election for the guy that should have won	2287	B
yeah so uh	2287	B
they really do i i sometimes think that that should be limited more	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
oh yes or they uh	2287	B
you know i i agree with the freedom of of the press and that's you know all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
no they don't	2287	B
and	2287	B
<silence>	2287	B
well i enjoyed talking to you	2287	B
all right thank you bye-bye	2287	B
	2287	B
<silence>	2287	A
okay did you vote in the last uh national election	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
oh that's good	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
i voted in the last national one yeah i'm not sure if i got the last local one	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah and you're not sure where to go and vote and all that	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
right or you don't know what they stand- you know where they stand or anything like that	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah i think you're right	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah or sometimes they don't like either of the choices	2287	A
for the candidates so they think well you know why vote	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah really especially in Texas	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
it really was yeah it was a mess	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
did you think it's a serious problem that half the people don't vote or	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah it also seems like maybe another- another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah it's kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected kind of scary when you think about that	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
oh gosh	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah people'll will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected next thing you know you've got him	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
right yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah i think so	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
right	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah he sure did	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or	2287	A
something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
uh-huh	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
right	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
uh-huh	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah i'm in Dallas and they're long here too so	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
right	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier i think- i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
uh-huh	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
uh-huh	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every	2287	A
you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on on what issues so i just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote	2287	A
but that	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
uh-huh	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
no i guess it'd be best if you knew what each person and what they stood for and why and everything but	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not and	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
oh yeah	2287	A
yeah the press has a lot of power	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah oh but boy you try get into that you'd really open a can of worms	2287	A
<silence>	2287	A
yeah seems like they should regulate themselves a little bit and i don't think they ever care to	2287	A
well i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting	2287	A
to talk about well it was good talking to you um bye	2287	A
	2287	A
	2281	B
<silence>	2281	B
oh Agatha Christie how about John D McDonald- uh John D McDonald you ever read him	2281	B
<silence>	2281	B
oh yeah he's very- he uh of course he he's dead now seems like most of the good ones are	2281	B
<silence>	2281	B

<silence>	2281	B
it's fairly facts whoever he talked to knew what uh the had had been in the program uh it that it was probably factual he's kind of overdone a lot of it but um but you have to do that to make the books	2281	B
<silence>	2281	B
um	2281	B
<silence>	2281	B
um i hadn't heard that one i hadn't uh	2281	B

<silence>	2281	B

<silence>	2281	B

all kinds of stuff and uh he he writes it it's it's history from the Indians point of view starting back when they first got the horse when they first captured the Spaniards	2281	B
and it just kind of follows forward and i got i got hooked on it and there's like about sixteen or eighteen	2281	B
	2281	A
i kind of like mysteries like Agatha Christie and that kind of stuff	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
no i'd actually i plead my ignorance- my knowledge- lack of knowledge i'm not familiar with him what is he is he an American novelist	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh-huh yeah i know they don't write anything like they used to the classics	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and have you been reading him a long time or	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
that long we won't talk about that	2281	A
yeah	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
i'm that's one of mine my husband's a little more inclined toward that but i'm not real uh interested in self-improvement books at all i think everything's too topical nowadays	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
yeah and i like a lot of things that are uh have to do with politics and uh history there was one a few years ago called the Public Palace about what goes on at the Pentagon	2281	A
did you read- are you do you interested in stuff like that or	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
oh okay	2281	A
 then you probably know even more than i do	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and i don't know have there been any good books- books published on that i know World War two my dad was a uh paratrooper in airborne one oh hundred and one um but i don't think they have done anything good on Viet Nam	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh-huh	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and is it true i mean is it um	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
i- i kind of one of my interests is um i've i'm interested in law and uh i just got a book for Christmas called Law and Order it's the history of the justice system and tracks um the the history of uh crimes and of	2281	A
things that have impacted just the the you know evolution of um how we punish people and why things are um judged the way they are	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
oh action adventure i probably	2281	A
you're not talking your Danielle Steele female by any means but on the other hand um i won't uh i can't uh Sidney Sheldon's does come off the shelf for light reading for	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum i've heard again i'm not familiar with reading him but i've heard of him	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
a real positive	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
there's one a book i just got i got it as a gift and i just started it's a little bit heavy but it was kind of interesting it um was on the best seller list for a while there it's called The Closing of the American Mind a little bit heavy about political philosophy	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
that's kind of what's happened- it kind of does happen yeah uh i'm trying to think of any self-improvement books i've read	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
yeah that's exactly right it's kind of like all the talk shows i think i got to get	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
oh um no i didn't but i- i- i have it and i haven't read it	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
that's exactly what happened to us we were living um in Minneapolis at the time and we were getting ready to come back to Texas um	2281	A
and	2281	A
i went i mean into a Waldon's and stood in line for like six hours it seemed like but i haven't read it there is a good one out though that we've had for a few years that i've actually read more than once it's called The Kingdom of Sound	2281	A
and it is really- really good about the um Saudis and just tracking their families and the Arabian culture	2281	A
it's well written actually	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and i think there're going to be more huh	2281	A
	2281	A
that's too bad that's not the topic i know self-improvement i think is the only one i got something like that when i got i'd been out of school for quite a while i think um back when it was again real topical um	2281	A
uh women my age about then were maybe having trouble with parents or mothers and a friend of mine bought me something called My Mother and Myself and i tried to read it and i went	2281	A
this is i did the same thing i went this isn't anything	2281	A
uh yeah	2281	A
yeah in fact i just started her a friend a friend of ours turned me on to that i always i always looked at spy novels and went eh	2281	A
military stuff just never really did anything to me unless it was history	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
the um China the red the i think it was the right author you'll have to help me out here	2281	A
Hunt for Red October the one i went to see the movie for	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
i was a little bit bored with it compared to some of the other stuff that i've heard he'd done	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh-huh	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
yes that one i've we actually have that one my husband's read that it that one seems like it might be a little more interesting	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh boy	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh-huh	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
that's what i- i was impressed with how much documenting he does	2281	A
how much how much um he's so much like Michener he's not as bad in terms of going into so much depth but he he's i like the way he writes	2281	A
and if it's not something that moves with me in the first two or three chapters something like that i just won't keep it you know	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
 that's	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and his action anecdotes weren't very good at all he he had he jumps around he in that particular book i don't know how his other ones are but in that one he jumped around a little bit	2281	A
in terms of subways and just just the general transition i mean it i didn't you know i really you have to be interested in the subject too i think that was part of my problem	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
anything to be real interesting yeah well it's good to talk to somebody i don't read as much as i used to um my husband's a TIer and i'm in journalism so i do a lot of writing um during the normal course of my job and it's kind of um	2281	A
sad when you find out the you know i thought i would get more toward reading and i'm getting less	2281	A
any of all years	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and what line does he write under what genre does he	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
oh	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh-huh	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
oh that might be kind of interesting is it	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and does he uh in terms of their- in terms of their practices and and their culture i mean does he does he document it or is it strictly	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
oh okay	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
does he tell it in narrative form or in third person how does he present it	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh-huh	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and then you still get information too	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
and what's his name again	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
Van- Van Lustbader okay	2281	A
yeah	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
Lustbader i'm going to write that one down yeah because	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
looking for something different yeah it's you know you walk into a store and you just like you said you're overwhelmed by how much there is and you just i don't know if you're like me you you you're more- much more voracious in terms of how much reading you're doing obviously but i go in and i like	2281	A
to me it's like being in a bakery but then i just don't find anything i like i pick up like eighteen things and then i'm not sure so i walk out	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
uh no that's more no that's not i do actually i like Asian cultures that why i was that's funny that you mentioned that	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
i thought that was uh do you like Michener at all	2281	A
he's good did you ever read he wrote Texas a few years ago	2281	A
that was good and Poland yeah and i've done some of those yeah i like i like things that are those are a few of the ones i can take of his i like it when they actually are giving you information in a novel format i guess would be the	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
Trail of the Spanish Bit okay	2281	A
yeah	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
oh my	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
um-hum	2281	A
<silence>	2281	A
	2276	A
where do you get most of your current events	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
uh-huh	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
yeah yeah i was i was uh we don't have cable so we were watching C N N a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control	2276	A
we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
it was extraordinary yeah we um um and then you know couldn't wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the uh the time of Watergate and just couldn't get enough of it	2276	A
but uh	2276	A
yeah um i it was the first couple of nights sitting up and watching T V late into the evening and you just wanted to get the latest news what was happening	2276	A
huh	2276	A
yeah yeah you just couldn't you couldn't put it down- you couldn't put it down	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
it did yeah it was like you know that what was it two steps forward one step back	2276	A
and uh but occasionally you know you'd stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and uh you really became addicted to it for a while	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
i try to um the newspaper comes uh in the morning and i leave for work at seven huh yeah yeah and uh i usually don't get a chance to sit down until after work	2276	A
and at that point i try- at least try to get through most most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
uh-huh	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
 where do what what newspaper do you get uh there	2276	A
how does it how does compare have you can you compare- like how does it compare to the Post	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
yeah that's funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something um and we pick up a local paper we're really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it's really provincial	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
is it really i mean	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
that's maybe- that's maybe because we get so you know we're so jaded with the Post uh	2276	A
	2276	A
but uh i probably do watch more T V because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o'clock news	2276	A
i watch that usually uh before we settle down uh depending what time we get to bed we'll usually watch the ten or the eleven o'clock news we have a ten o'clock news here at night and that's ideal	2276	A
because- because by ten thirty i start to fade	2276	A
so uh	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
what are you studying	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
like yeah i remember when i was in school	2276	A
yeah	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis	2276	A
uh i we could just we were all centered around that television yep	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
that's exactly right and i'd	2276	A
yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson	2276	A
uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
oh that's true yeah	2276	A
yeah	2276	A
that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
uh-huh	2276	A
yeah yeah	2276	A
does it does it bother you that uh at this point in your life that you're not getting more direct news or	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
what are you studying	2276	A
okay yeah um i guess	2276	A
yeah how old are you	2276	A
okay then i'm see i'm about twenty years older	2276	A
and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and uh i- i guess i regret i don't get enough local- really local we get some local papers but i guess i'm more interested in the national or international	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
overload- news overload	2276	A
<silence>	2276	A
yeah	2276	A
but	2276	A
well it's hard- i'll i'll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and there're so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it	2276	A
and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking talking to you okay	2276	A
i hope so	2276	A
take care bye-bye	2276	A
	2276	A
	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
oh well when the war was on i was watching the T V a lot	2276	B
 but um	2276	B
	2276	B
i haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
uh-huh	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah C N N coverage was really good	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
it kind of get wrapped up in it	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
kind of like watching the Olympics	2276	B
kind of like watching the Olympics	2276	B
	2276	B
yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
right right	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
do you uh normally read the newspaper every day	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
the what the Post	2276	B
	2276	B
 pretty good newspaper	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
uh-huh	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
i don't i don't regularly watch	2276	B
news or uh	2276	B
newspaper i- i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there's a war going on oh okay	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
uh just the Raleigh local paper	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
oh it's it's it's not even a comparison	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah the news is the same way the news- the local news here is kind of lousy	2276	B
it's not much different than when i lived in Roanoke Virginia which is really small town	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
	2276	B
that explains it	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
right	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
right	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
uh-huh	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
um	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
	2276	B
i'm in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i don't and i don't- i don't really don't have time for T V and newspaper just i wouldn't i wouldn't have time to read it so i'm	2276	B
finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most uh time effective	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
what's neat is seeing history happen you know	2276	B
i guess that's it	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
um in North Carolina there was a lot lot of service men from here you know and people really saw that	2276	B
saw it first hand	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
 yeah some of it got a little i- i don't know i thought it was a little too personal that they were digging each other life	2276	B
little too much maybe	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
uh no not really	2276	B
i'm in computer science	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
i see it as information age	2276	B
i'm twenty five	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
uh-huh	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
it's almost getting to the point where there is there's too much that	2276	B
yeah you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don't know it's a little near sighted but uh	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
yeah	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
okay did it work out your first time all right	2276	B
okay alright bye-bye	2276	B
<silence>	2276	B
	2262	B
well i um i haven't really lived in a lot of big cities i mean i'm living in Dallas now Plano is outside of Dallas but um	2262	B
so i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution	2262	B
but i know when i lived down in Houston um on the outskirts of Houston there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries	2262	B
and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something	2262	B
there would just be dumping this huge amounts of	2262	B
smoke into the air and and it always smelled really bad we know that that was	2262	B
really um really really bad for the atmosphere	2262	B
what have you got up there	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
uh-huh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
uh-huh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
oh no	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
sure	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
yeah	2262	B
and it's just i mean	2262	B
it's just so bad that there is just so much	2262	B
going into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up	2262	B
and plus all the problems in	2262	B
uh the Middle East with all that smoke and stuff and	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
yeah so it's just um you know why are why are we doing this to ourselves i just don't know but um i you know what really amazes me about like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries is	2262	B
that there would be houses and people living just really close to it i mean between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood and	2262	B
you just thought well it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there and what comes up must come down and	2262	B
and we	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
yes and and how you know if they have all of those um	2262	B
toxicity	2262	B
i mean it there's signs around saying how dangerous it is and then here you are living close to- next to it doesn't make too much sense	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
huh-uh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
huh-uh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B

um-hum	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
um-hum	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
well um individual companies and things are so selfish and their desires to save a few dollars and and that they don't care about the environmental impact that they make	2262	B
	2262	B
uh-huh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
yes	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
um-hum	2262	B
well have you ever visited um like Los Angeles or any place that's ever it's kind of known that it has uh pollution in it's air	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
um-hum	2262	B
uh-huh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
well it's	2262	B

<silence>	2262	B
um-hum	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
yes	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
that's really true and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like i've heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests and things and	2262	B
how they've had to how it's so much more expensive and things and i thought well it's so much better	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
uh-huh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
oh you don't	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
hum	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
uh-huh	2262	B
	2262	B
well i really think it must i think every i mean well think about how many automobiles there are	2262	B
and each is putting out like we have a car an older one of our cars is an older car and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement	2262	B
and you know that that is a sign that it	2262	B
yeah and that's all all cars are doing that and it's really polluting the air	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
huh-uh and it's also that	2262	B
it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things	2262	B
we sure wouldn't want	2262	B
so much more people suffering from that	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
huh-uh	2262	B
<silence>	2262	B
huh-uh	2262	B

<silence>	2262	B
no no it's scary it's scary	2262	B
it's really awful well i've really enjoyed the conversation it's helped me to think more about	2262	B
some issues that i need to be thinking more about	2262	B
huh-uh	2262	B
and it's you know uh instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say it's important to be involved ahead of time well you have a good day	2262	B
thank you	2262	B
bye-bye	2262	B
	2262	B
	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
well i i live out in the country so that part is good uh we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh which has a lot of pollution from their plants	2262	A
and right now in our area were fighting against a uh toxic waste incinerator	2262	A
and uh it won't be too far from where we live and everybody's really been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we don't want one any place	2262	A
we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh	2262	A
waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh	2262	A
the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much	2262	A
you know the uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
oh that has to be terrible over there	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
yeah	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
yeah yeah and we're breathing it we're we're breathing it all the time	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um-hum um-hum	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
no and i i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it So	2262	A
and they've shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that that they have	2262	A
uh they've reused some of it uh it can be recycled a lot of their things	2262	A
and that they've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more	2262	A
but once they get started it's really it saves them money in the end and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way	2262	A
and if they would all that's what that's what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
they're greedy it's money is what it is it's it's the money	2262	A
they're making fantastic amounts of money on these things and uh even the the incinerators	2262	A
the money and the income that they're going to make off of this is	2262	A
you know just astronomical	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
we've never been we went as far as like uh Las Vegas and Yellow Stone Park we we didn't go we should have gone the whole way over but we didn't	2262	A
but i understand that we have an aunt that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw	2262	A
she said they couldn't see those things out there	2262	A
because of the smog and everything else	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
no i've never been in New York i don't want to go there	2262	A
have you been there	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
oh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um no i never heard of that one	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
we're near Pittsburgh uh Clarion University	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
it's kind of northwest- kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
you sound very young are you a young person	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
thirty one you're young	2262	A
 no you're young you have a lot of life yet and and these we have some people who say well this isn't going to affect me this air pollution	2262	A
uh older people or	2262	A
they think they're far enough away from something	2262	A
that it's and they don't realize that these things are going to affect everybody and if if you're older and it's not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends	2262	A
uh everybody is going to be affected by it	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
they say it has really made a difference though	2262	A
now see we don't have that here yet	2262	A
no we don't have uh that testing in that down here yet	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
but they i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater	2262	A
and that it has made a big difference	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um-hum um-hum	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um-hum	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um-hum um-hum	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
something's coming out yeah	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
yeah	2262	A
yeah	2262	A
if if you have to put a price on it which is more valuable life or paying a little more-	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um-hum	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um-hum	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry	2262	A
we're paying industry to make the products and we're helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace	2262	A
then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesn't work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again	2262	A
now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
or the the where they want to put the the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion the two water sheds that- that feed Clarion river	2262	A
and you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because	2262	A
if that water gets contaminated it will go on down into Pittsburgh it will you know it it it affects so many people	2262	A
and it's just hard to think that they could allow	2262	A
them to do things like this	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
it really is	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
it is really a big concern	2262	A
its a	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
huh-uh	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
um-hum	2262	A
<silence>	2262	A
well you too	2262	A
huh-uh bye	2262	A
	2262	A
<silence>	2272	B
so regarding this proposal um	2272	B
personally i guess my my initial feeling is that it- it would be a great experience for kids um i- i don't think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community	2272	B
through school through college i- i just don't think people have that opportunity anymore	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
i think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that they- you know they they don't get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after school and they feel like they're producing um	2272	B
i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate in something like this you know	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum that's true	2272	B
that's true i mean it might turn people more off than on if they're forced to do something that they don't want to do	2272	B
i guess a year is a long time maybe six months might be a little bit more reasonable	2272	B
but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some people that had never thought of maybe going into social work or	2272	B
or that sort of thing um and gosh we all know that there's a need for that	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum that's true	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
i think it would be nice if they could	2272	B
you- almost give it as course credit	2272	B
you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh	2272	B
people are feeling like they're getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
right	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
yeah when i was in college i worked um with a group and i actually ran a Big Brother Big Sister program	2272	B
and	2272	B
besides just you know having this extracurricular thing i really noticed that it gave people a sense of commitment	2272	B
you know they learned that they need to if they make a a if they have a responsibility especially if it's dealing with another person	2272	B
you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that	2272	B
you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someone's relying on you you need to be there	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
oh it's really it's true	2272	B
yeah	2272	B
well i- i work at a in a personnel agency and um i've just found the work ethics of people to be disgusting	2272	B
i mean you know i'll someone might not show up for work and you'll call them and oh they overslept or oh they just didn't feel like going to work and so i lose my job i'll get another one	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
i- i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work you know	2272	B
but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before people develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but	2272	B
but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we're making them do that	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
yeah	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
yeah	2272	B
yeah it is i don't know i think it's a very interesting	2272	B
um discussion you know and and there's certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it	2272	B
um i i wish i had that sort of choice i mean maybe maybe it could end up being a choice	2272	B
and things that um you know what- the problem is that now it's seen as almost a punishment like when somebody um i don't know remember wasn't it Zsa Zsa Gabor that had to do community service work for like a year	2272	B
right- right or something like that and a lot of um you- felonies felony people you know have to do this sort of community service	2272	B
and i think it's getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldn't be looked at as a punishment	2272	B
it shouldn't be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did	2272	B
i- i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive	2272	B
um light towards it and have it look as something	2272	B
you know that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits out of it and not as something that you know oh you you did it instead of going to jail for three months or something like that i mean that's that's a feeling i get now and	2272	B
i i wouldn't want it i wouldn't want to be one of those people that's being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
um-hum	2272	B
but bad enough right yeah that's true	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
yeah right yeah	2272	B
<silence>	2272	B
really important yeah that's true-	2272	B
well this has been interesting	2272	B
you too take care bye-bye	2272	B
	2272	B
<silence>	2272	A
okay	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
uh-huh	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah probably not as much so	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
right i guess my i you know i come out am sitting on the fence but i have some concerns about uh you know if you require someone to do this for a year or two	2272	A
that's a big chunk out of someone's life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned	2272	A
but on the other hand you know how do you enforce it or what if they are just totally against it then does it really	2272	A
benefit anybody you know	2272	A
so	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
right	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
um-hum	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
right	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
or might teach them a little more empathy towards those who you know have problems and need help with things	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
well i was thinking too um we usually think of the Peace Corps as going overseas to do something but	2272	A
if they required this where you stay in the US and you know benefit the people here and perhaps too the fact that we have more elderly people now	2272	A
uh you know it could be an advantage to them	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
um um-hum	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah yeah	2272	A
well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this	2272	A
this is giving me some benefit as well i mean they they might not express it in words so much but just sort of get in step with with uh what's going on and and really enjoy it	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
hm	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
uh-huh i think a lot of our young people need to learn that	2272	A
	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
um-hum	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah i don't understand that either that's that's tough	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah well	2272	A
another thing too is if you have uh some young people who are really gifted and who are leaning towards maybe the uh math and science and that sort of thing which they say we have a shortage of	2272	A
taking them away from that which they are centered on might	2272	A
you know be a a bad thing to take a couple years out of beginning you know their life in that respect they might you know get off on some other track but you know it's hard to say	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
um-hum	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
um-hum	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
right	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
yeah	2272	A
but i guess that's not a terrible alternative if you've	2272	A
you know you've done something that's not too terrible but they want to slap your hand a little bit -so	2272	A
better than just sitting in jail all day not doing anything but but yeah i agree with your point it	2272	A
	2272	A
<silence>	2272	A
well i	2272	A
yeah enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye	2272	A
	2272	A
<silence>	2277	B
no but my husband's mother was in a nursing home	2277	B
and she was in there she got sick	2277	B
and they put her in a nursing home because_1 you couldn't we couldn't afford a nurse	2277	B
to- you know all- all day nurse	2277	B
yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts	2277	B
you know that's sixteen hours because_1 one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn't need one	2277	B
you know because_1 she would be sleeping so i would be here then	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see	2277	B
and the nurses aren't no	2277	B
see you have to pay that	2277	B
and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that's another thing i	2277	B
you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people don't care most of them_1 don't care some of them_1 do care	2277	B
the work that you know the the nurse aide that what the problem is i think it's the nurses' aide they don't pay them enough to keep them_1 there	2277	B
and to do the things that they need to do	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
uh-huh	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
oh yeah it's gets bad some of them_1 and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is	2277	B
you know because_1 they have some nursing home that don't have anybody that's not	2277	B
walking you know	2277	B
and it just depends on how bad that person is	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
you ought to do your job	2277	B
and if you can't if you can't i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
well	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
they steal- yeah that and they steal	2277	B
uh oh yeah i used to take uh every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh people um that work there	2277	B
you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because_1 she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them_1 in wheel chairs	2277	B
and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here	2277	B
because they went to the washer we didn't find it i said you all better find it	2277	B
and you know bedspread- her bedspread she- i took her a bedspread because she- a comforter because she was always cold	2277	B
and so uh you know then i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread i'm talking like it's	2277	B
it almost you know on both sides so that they can't turn it over and put it on somebody else's bed	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
huh-uh	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
yeah well see this- this one i- i is more or less first hand you know she just died um	2277	B
we buried her February but she had been in there at least i know for-	2277	B
seven years eight years	2277	B
and he didn't want to put her in there but he can't afford it	2277	B
and that's another thing you know	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
but you don't have- it depends on when didn't you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes	2277	B
sometimes you don't	2277	B
and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them_1 every time but don't tell the people	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
you have to do one of them_1 you know spontaneous things like maybe three o'clock in the afternoon or one o'clock in the afternoon and stuff like that because_1 they're not expecting you	2277	B
you know they expect you Saturday- like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week	2277	B
hum-um	2277	B
it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die that's about what it's for	2277	B
and it's really not some people don't need to be in there	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them_1 like a retirement home	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
don't	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them_1 every day you know go by and see what they need	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
little place to live you know even just a little room	2277	B
or whatever	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
sometimes yeah it depends on the patient	2277	B
and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals	2277	B
because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didn't have one	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
<b_aside> get my purse uh <e_aside>	2277	B
but it it it you know it just to me nursing homes are um	2277	B
bad news unless you can find a really good one	2277	B
and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones	2277	B
i mean	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
i told my husband well is this weird because see what people don't understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day	2277	B
and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them_1 that's the way i feel yeah	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
or maybe that won't not make it that far in life	2277	B
for what they did to somebody but	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
that's the whole that's what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh	2277	B
there's two people that i know you should not mess uh abuse and that's a child and a someone- person that's elderly you shouldn't abuse anybody but but down right	2277	B
them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what i'm saying	2277	B
you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody grown- uh say my age you know you know yeah	2277	B
because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone	2277	B
but they so old	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don't know	2277	B
and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh they're just senile	2277	B
you know huh-uh and that ain't right neither	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
so	2277	B
it it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in California	2277	B
before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones	2277	B
but now my mom and them had to pay for that too	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more	2277	B
if she you know since it was like my my grandmother had	2277	B
thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month	2277	B
which was better but see my husband's a only child	2277	B
	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
if yeah see and then there's another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if if one of her brothers didn't send in their check	2277	B
she would have to pay it	2277	B
you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it you know	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
um-hum	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
um-hum	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
just pretty	2277	B
oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house	2277	B
in California with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
um-hum	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
yeah	2277	B
and then you know it's like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life	2277	B
you know but not him he's never happy and i think that's that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more	2277	B
which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay	2277	B
you know	2277	B
<silence>	2277	B
<silence>	2277	A
have you had to put anyone in a nursing home	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
um	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah twenty four hours	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
oh	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh	2277	A
nursing- nursing home wouldn't it	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
oh and the nurse at home isn't oh okay i got you	2277	A
yeah i didn't know that	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A

in one for a little bit and uh he just he couldn't handle the things he had to do	2277	A

<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
well seems to me if a person gets into that area	2277	A
they i- i don't know it seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it	2277	A
uh	2277	A
yeah and um	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah i i've heard a lot of bad things about them_1 mistreating people and uh	2277	A

<silence>	2277	A
yeah they steal from them_1	2277	A

<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A

<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
what time you going to come in just come in uh	2277	A

<silence>	2277	A
yeah well i've heard uh some things you know uh i- i don't know where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment complex into a	2277	A
what you're saying for people who can take care of themselves but they they uh need a little help in doing it	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah each of them_1 have their own little apartment or little	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah well do they share rooms in nursing homes	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
um	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
bad news	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
well- i'll i'll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i'm never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all i've heard about it just not and i've heard	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
well if it ain't uh well you know uh	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
well	2277	A
yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that uh God will take care of them	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
true	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
or mine yeah i got you there	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
 or you can force them_1 to do it if you know	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah uh	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
no it's not	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
well	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah and then- and he'd have to pay it all	2277	A
yeah i know what big families are like and how they can get together if you if they're really cooperative and wanting the best	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
yeah	2277	A
well i know my mom from a uh family of at least sixteen i've lost count uh and my grandmother just died sometime last well about_1 two years ago	2277	A
and uh they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the uh	2277	A
hospital costs and stuff and uh you know there's some of my family that's not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close	2277	A
and uh then there's others who is uh-huh lots better off	2277	A
and	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
you know well in California too i've got a friend that lives out there and uh she's got a little two three bedroom house with a garage- a double car garage and it's costing her a thousand dollars a month	2277	A
California is high	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
that's what we keep saying	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
uh well that's	2277	A
<silence>	2277	A
well that's a good initiative uh i guess if if but	2277	A
 do you are you on a regular- regular exercise program right now	2229	A
	2229	A
oh well i'm kind of off and on	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
right now i'm kind of off	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
okay what type of exercise do you do	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
okay i guess you don't enjoy that very much	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
you find that uh to be boring	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah	2229	A
well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring	2229	A
but i	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah i haven't decided whether you're whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don't know if you've seen those advertised on TV	2229	A
it's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine but i haven't really sat down and used it much yet so it's collecting dust right now	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
i used to jog somewhat	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
uh-huh well that's good yeah my parents have a treadmill it's when i go visit them uh i'll get on that thing every now and then	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
um-hum no i just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought i'd better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
but uh yeah i need to start jogging again i've always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so i really don't ever keep a a program up consistently	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
no i never have well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go about a mile or two	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah it's it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
have to have the right type of uh shoes too that's very important	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
but	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah i don't have to buy jogging shoes all too often mine don't get very much use	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
uh-huh	2229	A
ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program	2229	A
so i'll i'll bicycle i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile but then i'll get tired of doing that and- maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week	2229	A
but uh that gets old too in a very short order i'm i'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh	2229	A
uh change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh start some type of uh regular program	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going	2229	A
uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise and uh one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine	2229	A
lifting weights and uh working out like that	2229	A
and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks	2229	A
i found that to be uh very helpful	2229	A
uh i need to i haven't started yet but it's a thought	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
sounds like something i should do	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
uh-huh	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
okay how far about how far do you go walking	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
okay	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah that's good well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging	2229	A
it	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
sure well if you keep up a a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going uh	2229	A
yeah	2229	A
	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah	2229	A
but it's a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
um-hum do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on TV	2229	A
okay which uh shows do you watch on TV	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
oh okay okay like a Kathy Smith workout or Jane Fonda	2229	A
 okay	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
right i will- every every now and then i'll watch uh ESPN i i get cable on TV and they have uh a couple of shows called Basic Training and um what is the other one called	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
uh-huh	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
Bodies In Motion that's that's the name of the one i was thinking of	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
with Gil Janklowicz	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
	2229	A
they're always in in in Hawaii someplace on on the on the beach	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah well they they do low impact stuff now they're on everyday	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah every morning	2229	A
it's on ESPN uh at what time i can't remember what time	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
it's uh	2229	A
-well i can't remember offhand what time	2229	A
they have that show on	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
yeah every now and then	2229	A
 um-hum	2229	A
 well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on TV	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock everyday	2229	A
Monday through Friday	2229	A
case you're interested in that	2229	A
 i actually taped a few of the sessions that they had on there but uh i haven't done so much as uh watch the tape that i made	2229	A
so i'm kind of bad about that myself	2229	A
<silence>	2229	A
 okay well i sure enjoyed talking to you about uh exercise and fitness	2229	A
so all right good night bye	2229	A
	2229	A
<silence>	2229	B
yes and i hate it how about_1 you	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
off and on well i guess i've been kind of off and on i've um	2229	B
had some health problems that have led me to uh stay more on than off	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
not not really	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah- yeah and time consuming i mean it's	2229	B
it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming it's uh you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
i know you go through this this is something you go through like every year	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
hum-um	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
 yeah a lot of things do that i have a negative- i had an exercise bike i used to have one and finally got rid of it because_1 i never used it but i do use my treadmill	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah i can't ride a bike so	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
oh	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah it's too nice been too nice of a weekend	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
uh	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
you had any injuries from jogging	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body and- and that you know	2229	B
you can end up getting hurt worse	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
um-hum	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah that's not quite so so easy yeah yeah	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
 well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months	2229	B
so	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah well don't let it collect dust you	2229	B
	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
well	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah that that'll be good	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
um-hum	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
oh	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
um-hum	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
so are you gonna do that	2229	B
	2229	B
well that sounds like something good to do then	2229	B
yeah	2229	B
nice way to start off the spring	2229	B
get back in shape	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
well i do i switch every other day one day i walk and one day i do the aerobics	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
 well i'm trying build up my tolerance now i just- surgery um less than two months ago and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half but i try- try to workup to three miles	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah it takes it's just- that- it takes longer to get the same effect yeah but	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it	2229	B
no i- i just do it on TV i have a cassette	2229	B
um it's just- a it's a tape- i use tapes	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
Richard- or Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
uh-huh	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
there was one guy i used to watch on ESPN i don't know if he's still on it anymore or not i don't i don't know if i get ESPN or not	2229	B
but um well yeah i used to watch one- watch one on the air but that was back	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
that was yeah	2229	B
yeah yeah i watched that cause he was cute	2229	B
	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
yeah yeah but then that was back when um you know the high impact and	2229	B
do they are they- yeah okay- they're so they're still he's still doing it then huh oh i'll have to tune in	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
i'll have to check it check check it back up then but- the thing is is everybody always looks so good on there show least on some of the other ones not everybody has a picture perfect body	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
i haven't watched any other ones on TV um just on some of the tapes so	2229	B
	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
now that's a thought	2229	B
<silence>	2229	B
 well that's a thought i hadn't thought about doing that	2229	B
 well they're gonna beep us pretty soon	2229	B
 uh-huh nice talking to you okay thanks talk to you later bye	2229	B
	2229	B
	2269	A
camping uh is a pretty vague term it seems to encounter or cover a lot of different kinds of	2269	A
of uh shall we say over night trips or sometimes not even over night uh anything from no provisions to uh going with what you can carry on a backpack uh maybe even a tent	2269	A
go up to uh state parks with six shelters and little screened in areas and then travel trailers and all the way up to conference center type campings that have uh you know air conditioning like hotels with uh	2269	A
uh ski boats and whatever else may be around some people uh they they still call that a camp so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that kids do at those camps but then go to their little hotel- air conditioning room at night	2269	A
so uh i've been through most all of that i've not done much of the no provision survival type but i've done backpacking in tents and state park shelters and travel trailers and uh camping camping with nice air conditioned rooms	2269	A
and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones with more entertainment than uh survival in mind	2269	A
uh one of the times that we were at a uh state park we went up into Oklahoma and went to a place called Broken Bow and	2269	A
rented a few canoes with a church group we were with bunch of college age kids	2269	A
 and we took these canoes into a river that would feed it that would bring us back down toward drove up upstream and then	2269	A
worked our way back down toward the campsite that we were at	2269	A
and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the water was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and	2269	A
at one point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the branches that were over the the	2269	A
 uh river part there and you could see debris in those branches where the water had just been a couple of weeks prior	2269	A
so it was you know ten or so feet uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the	2269	A
camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water	2269	A
well that's encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about you'll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it uh it was a little bit laborious instead of a a six to eight hours worth of canoeing we ended up only	2269	A
surviving about uh half the trip and it took us us about ten hours so we we got in our car half way and and went and got the rest of the vehicles and brought them up stream and	2269	A
loaded it all back up and went back to the campsite exhausted but uh i have had better camping canoeing trips uh as it were uh like the Guadalupe down in South Texas it's got some real nice uh	2269	A
canoeing uh water in it have you been camping much	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
um-hum	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
 that's true	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
hum	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
um-hum	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
yeah	2269	A
i wonder if uh being from uh	2269	A
Dallas area i- i wonder if if it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping i- i seems like back packing goes well with	2269	A
mountain and sceneries- sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you were in when you left so	2269	A
uh unless you go over toward East Texas where there's a considerable- considerable amount of woods or if you go	2269	A
uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a	2269	A
a either a lake that you'd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do uh	2269	A
but there's not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks there are in more of the the eastern part of the state where there's woods worth worth seeing but uh that's interesting i hadn't	2269	A
all the people that i know that do back packing usually go up to Colorado or go up somewhere and you know get away from the state to actually do that kind of uh camping	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
that's not too bad	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
that's not too bad at all	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
um-hum	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
	2269	A
yeah	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
huh	2269	A
yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was	2269	A
oh the campsites were uh	2269	A
not perfect but they were you know basic rail road ties and laid in sand so it wasn't just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some	2269	A
you could uh drive a stake in fairly easy and and get the thing nailed down but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge	2269	A
and uh the very first time we went up there with this group of people we all set up these tents most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular one works and how this one works and it's eleven o'clock at night and it's you know your doing it by the head lights of the cars and	2269	A
and about uh oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said	2269	A
huh yeah yeah doing- doing just fine you know it's a little windy but i'm doing all right and	2269	A
and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and uh	2269	A
then it started to rain so we didn't get too wet but uh it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and	2269	A
woke up a little late the next morning but uh when we finally got back from that that outing one of the uh parents of one of the kids had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the	2269	A
the radio and they clocked a ninety seven mile an hour winds on the dam right in front of that lake and there's really nothing to stop it it's uh thirty or forty miles wide it's a huge uh	2269	A
lake right on the border of Texas and Oklahoma there and	2269	A
and it had a the little little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the water with uh nothing blocking us from this wind it's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that but uh i'm sure that was just uh	2269	A
the top speed of the wind but it it did manage to take all our tents out	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
yeah yeah	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
yeah that's for sure	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
yep	2269	A
<silence>	2269	A
that's true	2269	A
on that same lake there's another portion of it that's uh	2269	A
real uh carved out the the the	2269	A
shoreline- shoreline is	2269	A
uh up against rock and it's it's pretty far cliff i'd say shirt or forty feet worth	2269	A
and the campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the little rail road ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach	2269	A
and that was uh a that particular campout	2269	A
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
right	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
huh	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
huh	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
huh	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
 i mostly do uh back packing	2269	B
uh as opposed to any of the other sorts	2269	B
um	2269	B
though i guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type	2269	B
uh-huh the uh yeah i've	2269	B
done things uh i guess mostly	2269	B
upstate Michigan the Adirondacks White Mountains um Appalachian Trail kinds of things uh i prefer going out either	2269	B
with one other person or by myself for about a week	2269	B
and i guess i just look at it as i time i can get away from it all and	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
kind of rely on my own resources a bit although i guess i haven't gone survival camping where i actually got to scrape together all my food i've always carried it with me but uh	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
still it's you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and	2269	B
enjoy the wildlife	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
huh	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum yeah i end up well yeah i mean i do a lot of like even weekender kind of things i go out for just one or two nights uh it's not my favorite thing but i can do it a lot more often so like over at the uh particularly in the uh	2269	B
the fall and spring when the insects haven't come out yet uh where they're already gone uh	2269	B
you know i spend almost every weekend up in the mountains and i guess i live about five hours away from	2269	B
some place to go hiking where i am now	2269	B
um	2269	B
pardon me	2269	B
no no it's not bad and uh yeah i mean if it's if you can find somebody who's uh	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
you know willing to go out for several days you know and can handle that sort of thing uh which	2269	B
isn't everybody you run across obviously who's willing to	2269	B
you know put seventy or ninety pounds on their back and go hiking uh but uh it can be a lot of fun	2269	B
and uh i there's certainly other people who go out uh canoeing i mean there's usually lots and lots of ponds uh particularly	2269	B
uh for canoeing and you know there are places you can drive in and park and they've got the usual kinds of campgrounds and stuff but uh you can also just you know {bushwack} or go on semi trailed areas	2269	B
and just get three days from any place that's civilization	2269	B
and that's kind of fun	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
oh boy	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
huh	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
yeah it's funny when you talk about you know this it sort of reminds me that every time i'm	2269	B
telling somebody about like a camping trip and i've i've done quite a few say with my sister is the stuff that you remember isn't you know really so much the uh	2269	B
	2269	B
	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
um-hum	2269	B
<silence>	2269	B
	2292	B
hi Kay	2292	B
i uh was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
 yeah	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
uh-huh	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
sure	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
yeah i don't ever want to have to worry about that that's real important to me um you know we have that that Aetna	2292	B
um that's what we the insurance that we have right now when we were in Colorado they had um a different type of HMO there that i really liked a lot	2292	B
it was um not that kind of HMO's where you have to go to their they're sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an HMO where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular	2292	B
hospitals and all that but it was with a certain list of of doctors that you know participated in the HMO	2292	B
and um you know then you only had to pay the it for us it was a five dollar copayment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions	2292	B
and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time that those prescriptions can be very expensive	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
um-hum	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
do you-	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
do you have the basic plan or do you have the the other one	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
right	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
the one that's like you get additional they'll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures we just have the basic right now and	2292	B
for most things it tends to cover it we don't have too many major um expenses at this point but we have been able to find	2292	B
doctors- dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays a couple of times we've had to pay oh i don't know three to five dollars but that's not that bad	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
um-hum	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
no we don't like that either	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
is his office in Plano	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
oh that's not bad	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
right	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
oh yes you're not kidding	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
that's right	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
well that- those are some of the things that are very important to us too um	2292	B
we we'd like you know other benefits that are provided um the athletic facilities that that you can sometimes take advantage of um	2292	B
i think that's that's pretty nice but i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that but that's a that's a nice benefit to have	2292	B
	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
right	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
yeah that that's one of the i think the hard things right now i mean they're going through some some tough times to say the least uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um guidelines um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think it's often	2292	B
in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times	2292	B
smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company it's hard to do that because_1 there're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that	2292	B
just one of the things that that happens when someone when you're dealing with a large company	2292	B
but	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
um-hum	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
right	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
how long has he been in his present position	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
uh-huh	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
well i was going to say it sounds like you you picked out a lot of good things you know for him to to have- to uh to choose in a position that has a lot of thought put into it	2292	B
in a big company though you also get moved around a lot he may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time or or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know	2292	B
	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
uh-huh	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
right	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
yeah we're very	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
we're very far from our families and it's really hard families- little children and um they were the only grandchildren	2292	B
	2292	B
i loaded the kids in the car and we went downtown and met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket and i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
yeah i mean it's- it's hard i mean to to just for us to snatch a half hour like that is is a special occasion for us so um	2292	B
it's nice	2292	B
it's nice that you can have your family close like that	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
yeah sometimes it can be	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
that's good	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
okay	2292	B
well i have too	2292	B
<silence>	2292	B
okay you too bye-bye	2292	B
	2292	B
<silence>	2292	A
hi	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
uh-huh	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
well um i we just recently graduated from Rice University and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things and some of the things that were important to me	2292	A
my- uh when my husband was looking for his job was um	2292	A
hours you know we he had been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all so i was you know didn't want him to have a job that	2292	A
would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things so that was important to me and also insurance	2292	A
for the family- our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
uh-huh	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum us too	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
well that's nice	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
uh-huh that's good	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
oh i know we just went through that ourselves	2292	A
we just you know were like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum the	2292	A
yes	2292	A
yes it's pretty bad well yeah and we um we were interested in having dental- dental insurance too because um well- having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff and	2292	A
we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
we have um you know we're at Aetna with uh an we have like the	2292	A
medical- the dental insurance is separate is that what you mean and i don't think it's the basic i think it's the other one	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum uh-huh	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
uh-huh no that's great yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too	2292	A
yes and let's see besides insurance other things that we looked at um	2292	A
well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or something	2292	A
 so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well he's uh you know he's at the one that's at um	2292	A
seventy five at uh six thirty five and so well- by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away and	2292	A
especially- especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting	2292	A
and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving	2292	A
and um so that was something that was important to us and because_1 like- like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know	2292	A
made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum that's true that's really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement	2292	A
i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be having- having now but when	2292	A
when could uh your salary increase and	2292	A
is there was there somewhere to go	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
yes that- that we can make our mortgage payments and	2292	A
yeah that's really true	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
uh-huh	2292	A
but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he	2292	A
felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for	2292	A
	2292	A
thinking he could um work under those-	2292	A
oh just since last- last summer it's only been not even a year yet so	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
yes we're	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
 oh yeah	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
you never know we're hoping that that won't be the case we	2292	A
i think one of the most- one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um	2292	A
my husband was raised in Irving	2292	A
and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean it's not that far but	2292	A
people would have- we didn't have anyone in town that was our family and although we had really good friends and and we had church and school support and things um	2292	A
we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that	2292	A
so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose TI and chose to move this way	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
	2292	A
	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
oh that's nice	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
yeah and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family and	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
um-hum	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
well that's definitely the way we feel	2292	A
<silence>	2292	A
we're really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family but it's turned out really good and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and	2292	A
we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us	2292	A
	2292	A
	2292	A
why do you think so few people vote then	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
what part what part would you say the big brother aspect plays the people that don't want to be called for	2230	B
jury duty or or things that they've heard that says you know well they use this registration for this purpose or that so they just don't bother	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
hum	2230	B
okay_1 and then what about the smaller election say some of the city elections uh even down to the uh school board type uh elections i guess there are so many	2230	B
that you can uh weed out the ones that you really want to partake in	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
 right	2230	B
well it's a shame that uh that even the politician who wants to give give out good information about himself	2230	B
uh has trouble in virtually everything he does say that's positive or or even mediocre gets attacked from the other side	2230	B
such that he spends more of his time defending than he can putting forth any decent information	2230	B
uh and then once you get off the candidate's personal information then you want to get into an actual issue and then how the candidate feels about that	2230	B
there's there's very little room for or very little time to handle all the different things you'd like to know about a candidate and then unfortunately after you do get some of that information you may find out it weren't true to begin with so	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
i would say that it's much easier to deal with the the the public the uh media that's that's giving the information to the public is much easier to deal with uh any personality quirk or any negatives that they've found or any skeleton in the closet	2230	B
than to try and first educate the public to the point where they can	2230	B
listen to either side of a given issue	2230	B
uh and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues lets say that Texas- uh Texas State uh Railroad Commission has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
right	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
right	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
so hence more apathy i guess or confusion	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
hum boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important doesn't it	2230	B
yeah a lot more appointee's i guess makes him carry a lot more weight	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe one man who can at least get his party together	2230	B
so hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
right	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
did you go early in the morning or	2230	B
after work	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
hum that's interesting	2230	B
well where- in my little district fortunately it is literally across the street i could walk over there as it were we live across from the school and so we	2230	B
i drive out of my complex early in the morning and go over there usually before the polls even open and and vote right at the you know number one or two sometimes the third or fourth person in in line	2230	B
and i wait longer to to watch them_1 set up than i do actually in the in the line itself but that gets me out of there at a time that i can go down Central and not be bothered by the the traffic as it were	2230	B
because_1 normally i'm i'm at work before seven so uh just stay a little later that as it were and and make the the effort to vote	2230	B
uh but unfortunately since there are so many other things that uh our city wants to vote on	2230	B
they don't they they tend to make the elections if it's a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles	2230	B
so i don't always i don't always vote at the same place so it's a little bit more trouble for me to well this election's going to be held this date and i've got to go over here	2230	B
and i've got to remember uh you know on this election i'm in this district in this election i'm for here and uh you know this precinct votes here	2230	B
and i would just assume in holding still and all vote in the same place as many times as they want	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
right	2230	B
probably wouldn't even hurt to have a section that says here's how this particular office affected you or could have affected you over the last several years you know these are the kinds of decisions that this particular judge or this particular	2230	B
uh Railroad Commission for instance does	2230	B
if if you know if he he does do something or you pay attention to this or this is the guy to to blame for this if uh you didn't like what happened	2230	B
you are right there is no uh no such deal other than the small publication that uh	2230	B
uh League of Women Voters puts out it supplements that newspaper that i get a local newspaper they they published but uh nothing per se in the major newspaper and as hungry as they are for things to print you'd think they'd want to do that	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
um-hum	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
right	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
that's true	2230	B
with so many elected officials i guess there's just so many people to go around in some of those cases	2230	B
hum well i hear someone calling me so i better let you go	2230	B
yeah at least bye	2230	B
<silence>	2230	B
<silence>	2230	A
why do i think so few people vote i	2230	A
i think a lot of it is uh apathy um um	2230	A
for example uh when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people	2230	A
figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal	2230	A
um and in others cases you know they they see themselves as one voter in a million and they think what difference is it going to make whether i vote or not they they feel like one vote doesn't have an impact	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
and i think a lot of cases like a lot of our	2230	A
minority issues the we had the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in Dallas a while back	2230	A
and it lost well that was decided by a very small margin	2230	A
um and there were a lot of of minorities that wanted it to go	2230	A
the way that it didn't go	2230	A
but they also had very low voter turnouts especially_1 like in the Hispanic community	2230	A
and i think in that case they've just they developed a distrust of the system	2230	A
and so they've chosen not to participate in it	2230	A
and i think that's part of it	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
what do you think	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
 oh	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
i've i've heard people say that i know it's it's a real thing and i think it makes a difference	2230	A
as to how many people vote apparently not being a citizen not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them_1 that they don't want to have any say	2230	A
in uh politics	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
well	2230	A
last November was my first election in Dallas i've only lived in Dallas a little over a year	2230	A
and i went down this long list of judges that i was voting for	2230	A
and	2230	A
i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know what the responsibilities of the judges were i didn't know anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet	2230	A
and i'm going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here	2230	A
so what's the point in voting for these people i- i mean it you know i get just as good of results as if i through darts at a board	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
um-hum	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah you you think then that uh part of it is because the uh it flashes too much on the personal uh characteristics of the candidate rather than his uh	2230	A
job performance issues	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
um-hum	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
i'd i'd say	2230	A
yeah i'd say there's a large number especially of urban young voters that don't know what the Railroad Commission does	2230	A
and so they go you know who- who who what does it matter who i vote for	2230	A
i think well that's one thing i've noticed i've i've lived a couple of different places i've noticed Texas seems to have more elective offices than any place i've ever been	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
well a lot more confusion you know i in- in other towns i've never been called upon to decide all this long list of judges i've never been called upon to decide	2230	A
you know we're we're voting for Railroad commissioner and and uh Land commissioner and that sort of thing and in other state these would be appointments of the governor	2230	A
we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
well it does	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
um-hum	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different departments pulling against each other	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
the- the- the big problem i guess with the mass media is you know	2230	A
uh you don't have time to educate the public on these matters because the public is not going to sit still and soak the message in	2230	A
i mean anything that can't be covered in thirty seconds or less they're not going to care about it	2230	A
or or if you can't dramatize it and put it on Unsolved Mysteries then they're not going to you know they're not going to want to hear it	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
uh the the line what i waited maybe ten minutes in line	2230	A
it was- it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly	2230	A
worth it to me i think	2230	A
i went right after work so that was when the line is the longest	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
uh-huh	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
um-hum	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
hum	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
so you have to go a little out of your way huh	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
um-hum	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah i would also like better	2230	A
information on	2230	A
on what on you know what am i voting on and and who some just general statements about the candidates i guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers	2230	A
and i didn't see much of it	2230	A
like you know i see- you saw a lot about the major races but a lot of the minor ones that you're being called upon to decide there's very little information on	2230	A
as far as you know what what is the duties of this political office and uh and what are the characteristics or what- what are the	2230	A
issued statements and	2230	A
uh spoken goals of the uh candidates	2230	A
i'd like to get	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
um-hum	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah well they the Dallas Morning News did publish a a section that covered the major races and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of	2230	A
better informed decisions	2230	A
but still uh	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
you know it it left a lot of the the the local races the races unique to my precinct	2230	A
uh up in the air there is one thing that that did annoy me and that is the the my congressman last fall didn't have anybody running against him so basically i had no choice	2230	A
and i think uh	2230	A
in some districts you know there's a a party one party or another that has such a lock on it	2230	A
that uh you know why vote when it's decided already	2230	A
that sort of attitude	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
yeah	2230	A
<silence>	2230	A
well we used the five minutes up	2230	A
 okay	2230	A

<silence>	2237	B

and then i put uh like a black plastic it's really not a black plastic it they call it Weedex and i put that down and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that	2237	B
and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week	2237	B

<silence>	2237	B
yeah	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
all right	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B

<silence>	2237	B
so you all are into	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
so you all are into the lawn big time huh	2237	B
yeah i only got well i guess i got um my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre	2237	B
and i have a pretty nice backyard and you know i've got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other odds and ends	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
no and it's nice i'm just inside the city limits i'm probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits and i'm only a mile and a half from work	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
yeah it's pretty nice	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
i have the room outside i need and i don't really have all the room in the house i need but	2237	B
no	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the are they called uh roly-poly bugs that's what my son calls them anyway	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
roly-poly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball	2237	B
i don't know what they're called	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
they look like they've got yeah no no it's not like a no	2237	B
you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it's moist	2237	B
and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball	2237	B
i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see	2237	B
i i don't know	2237	B
yeah under bricks or under	2237	B
wood or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there they usually come out at night but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up been laying around no	2237	B
a slug is actually kind of slimy and- and these are just he plays with them all the time he picks them up and rolls them across the patio	2237	B
no	2237	B
no they're not real hard	2237	B
they're like a water bug of sorts i don't know what they called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
but i'm plagued with those	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
you know i think it's because- probably because we're in more of a tempered zone you know we don't really we only freeze down here in January and February at the most you know	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
yeah i got fire ants too	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
and you spray in one part of your lawn and they just move to another part so you got to spray your whole yard and then	2237	B
your your neighbor gets them and then he sprays his yard and you get them back again so yeah but we're not doing too bad down here really you know the daffodils are out and and uh	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B
yeah	2237	B
<silence>	2237	B

<silence>	2232	B
well let me preface it i'm a i was a staff officer in Vietnam in sixty nine and seventy	2232	B
and i'm in active reserve now so	2232	B
uh i'm probably not going to have the opinion you think i would have	2232	B
um	2232	B
it's it was an interesting	2232	B
in that i think that he gave the American people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians	2232	B
uh i are you old enough to remember the war	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
yeah uh	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
well December seventy two was when uh we bombed North Vietnam and	2232	B
and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that that time frame	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
i think the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf	2232	B
well they	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
well	2232	B
what what's your perspective on it	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
yes	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbor's keepers	2232	B
and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and whether it's in a uh you know Chicago or	2232	B
uh or or Dallas i- i think if we see it you know we see John Wiley Wiley- Price hollering injustice i think that's wrong now the question is is was there injustice in Vietnam or was there injustice in Iraq and Kuwait	2232	B
the difficult i point is is to where do we step in and and i think that we	2232	B
that's that's the part i have difficulty and the the other part is that the the when when your when your	2232	B
when you're looking at Vietnam and you say well	2232	B
is fifty eight thousand lives worth it	2232	B
and i don't know that anything is worth fifty eight thousand lives	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
well the other issue is is is how do you allow uh how how do you allow injustice just like the the policeman in in Los Angeles	2232	B
how could how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy	2232	B
if your brother or your sister were being beaten	2232	B
by the authorities do we step in well	2232	B
in some cases we would and i- i think that's what makes it so difficult	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
but	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
yeah but but the other the other difficulty is is that it's just if if you take the admonition to to feed my sheep	2232	B
and the question is who are my sheep	2232	B
and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
but	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
yes uh they did the	2232	B
i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian economy like South Vietnam was that in reality uh the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes	2232	B
and the question is who was he going to pay it to	2232	B
uh the Communists or the uh alleged Democrats uh democratic form of government and i	2232	B
i think that's i think i think uh that's a little was a difficult part there and and i we didn't understand the culture we couldn't uh we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our	2232	B
in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and and the people looked like children i mean you couldn't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and	2232	B
and and do these kind of things i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people you just couldn't believe that they would	2232	B
that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and and napalm them_1 you know if	2232	B
and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions and i think that if anything that when Schwartzkopf he was saying the idea that we learned we learned- we learned a lot from Vietnam	2232	B
now it was it was it was in general bad but and i don't know the problem is now i'm i'm concerned a little bit that that now that the Gulf War is on that we're going to think it was a good war and it was okay	2232	B
to go beat up on people and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home i'm not sure how we get that whether there's a connection there but	2232	B
in any event	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
well the difficulty is is if you look in the Old Testament and and the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the Promised Land	2232	B
that they that they uh they didn't destroy everybody and that that's	2232	B
and	2232	B
and that that you know and you i think that's one of those things when we get to Heaven we're going to ask God	2232	B
	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
what do you	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
yeah	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
well and i- i and even at the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted	2232	B
what do you do turn the other cheek	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
yeah	2232	B
<silence>	2232	B
	2232	A
okay so what are your opinion on it	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
not- not much i'm twenty eight so no i really don't remember anything about it i guess i was about ten when it ended right	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
i was born in sixty two so when did it end	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
yeah	2232	A
so i was ten and i don't remember a lot about	2232	A
anything at that time in my life very much in great detail	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
no i didn't	2232	A
but i- i did read the book i have- do have i have six years of college	2232	A
so i did read and study about the Vietnam War though so i am pretty familiar- you know i'm more familiar with it than	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
mine i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that	2232	A
i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there	2232	A
and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on	2232	A
i don't i don't know i don't really i'm tired of pacifist though see on the other hand	2232	A
i'm a pacifist- i'm really struggling with it i'm a pacifist physical pacifist i'm a Christian	2232	A
and i believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein or the North Vietnamese but it's in spiritual kingdoms	2232	A
and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees so	2232	A
in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist but i'm really not you know what i'm saying	2232	A
i don't think just lay back and not do anything i think lets go to war but let's go to war praying and let's go to war for that way so	2232	A
	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
yeah	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
still have a problem with uh you know i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but	2232	A
and i know other Christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but	2232	A
you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you	2232	A
i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with Vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and	2232	A
and then shoot them_1	2232	A
you so	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
yeah it is a difficult thing but then vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord and i will pay	2232	A
so i think God ultimately in charge of	2232	A
what goes on in i know like Mao Tse Chung in China he did all these terrible things and they were terrible and he's gonna be accountable for them	2232	A
and but if you look back you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he tore down all the temples he	2232	A
he unified the Chinese language it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in China	2232	A
because of all that and so even in North and South Vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing	2232	A
and that now he build roads so then he'd open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead and so something good did come out of that in that	2232	A
now you see what i mean it's like now	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
uh-huh	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
well bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also	2232	A
so if the the the the South Vietnamese they asked us to help them right	2232	A
is that right	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
yeah	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
uh-huh	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
yeah	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
yeah	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
yeah but then again yeah i'd say it is wrong to invade Kuwait and i'm not saying President Bush made the wrong decision i think i'm lacking in my	2232	A
i don't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the Vietnam War because i'm going to interpret that	2232	A
through the Bible and i've kind of always i have been a Christian five years and i've kind of avoided that	2232	A
that those the war things and how God approaches that	2232	A
because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
right	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
i know	2232	A
but then again though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies but don't only don't kill them_1 bless them_1 you know	2232	A
and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like	2232	A
but i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it	2232	A
would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you	2232	A
what can we do to rectify this situation	2232	A
and that God would move in that sovereignly and he would get the glory though no king no Bush wouldn't	2232	A
because it wouldn't make any sense you know what i'm saying it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because	2232	A
if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because_1 those are that's	2232	A
the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory	2232	A
<silence>	2232	A
um-hum	2232	A
no well i believe personally i hope- i	2232	A
this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go yeah for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to to to take authority over that	2232	A
and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes	2232	A
and just say i bind you in Jesus name your i just and rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on	2232	A
and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally that's not normal	2232	A
there's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the Holy Spirit to be able to pray over that	2232	A
do you see what i mean and then the same in Vietnam you would you wouldn't handle Vietnam the same way you would handle uh Saddam Hussein	2232	A
but i just i have a problem with all the killing but i'm not a new ager i don't believe	2232	A
means that i am not for one world government i'm not for all these new age things i- i don't have a problem with uh	2232	A
national identity and i'm an American and having different nations and all of this	2232	A
but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like God has a better way to handle it than that and	2232	A
	2275	A
okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows	2275	A
and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um one of them's Quantum Leap	2275	A
and the other one is Night Court and i think i think they're real different i mean i don't think they have anything in common uh Quantum Leap has i mean Quantum Leap is kind of	2275	A
a comedy in its own way i guess but uh mostly it's it's kind of science fiction and it's um adventure and things like that um and then Night Court is just pure you know weird fun you know just	2275	A
it's it's nothing serious about it at all so i don't know why the two of them_1 happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
 yeah	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
he is	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
yeah that's right i mean	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
well they they really have changed him though if if you've watched it this season um he's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but uh he's involved in that charity	2275	A
and uh it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show	2275	A
that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff	2275	A
and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
which of course he needed	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
right right that's that's good point	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
okay_1	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
Deedee	2275	A
yeah i agree	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
yeah i can't remember what her name is but uh	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum well but see i read an article about uh in TV Guide about uh about Hunter and about his latest- you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them_1	2275	A
and they say that uh that there was absolutely- that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use i mean you know uh	2275	A
yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners	2275	A
yeah	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
and- uh and and even even at the beginning Deedee and and Hunter	2275	A
would decide that one of them_1 would go do this while the other one would do would go this but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations	2275	A
you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen you know	2275	A
so yeah i i i kind of agree with that	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
well i'm afraid that's what they they really wanted to do um	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
yeah well see there was that spark between Deedee and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting	2275	A
uh show to where you never really knew	2275	A
which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um	2275	A
you know it's it- i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do	2275	A
yeah	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
but it's it's always been a formula uh for TV that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married	2275	A
that the show ends up well- you know dying	2275	A
a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probably- well maybe it's not a good example i've been watching	2275	A
Nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called Maximum Smart they had Get Smart for uh ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night -until six or -until five o'clock the next morning	2275	A
all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them_1 got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum the same thing	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
yeah the it- it- it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and	2275	A
and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character's uh	2275	A
uh personalities um um well especially after they get married um	2275	A
couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon	2275	A
she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who everyone- always solved the things and and figured out and kept	2275	A
Max from getting real messed up well toward- whenever they got married she got dingy	2275	A
you know why would they do that	2275	A
it it made no sense	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
 yeah	2275	A
unfortunately that's probably true	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
well do you watch um	2275	A
what is that show uh Who's the Boss	2275	A
it's uh that's on Tuesday nights i think	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i've seen it they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them_1 get together and then they pulled them_1 apart	2275	A
and i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show's all about so i always thought that was kind of weird	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
hum right	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
well do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet	2275	A
yeah i mean	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
yeah	2275	A
now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don't particularly like either one of them_1 but um	2275	A
uh their marriage was so highly publicized	2275	A
that there was no way that they could stay together	2275	A
uh or at least that's the way i look at it	2275	A
so i don't know	2275	A
 yeah i would think so	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
um-hum	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
yeah it's it wouldn't be easy	2275	A
so hum	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
well that's kind of interesting	2275	A
so um	2275	A
well i guess- i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
 yeah it has Becky i really appreciate it	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
well i think i've um you're the second female i've talked to	2275	A
yeah it's it's kind of nice	2275	A
so	2275	A
uh-huh bye-bye	2275	A
<silence>	2275	A
	2275	A
<silence>	2275	B
okay	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
okay	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
	2275	B
it's funny that those are my two husband's- my husband's two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didn't like Night Court	2275	B
and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because_1 i've seen it so much now i'm involved with the characters but	2275	B
i used to think um	2275	B
Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me and and i told my husband that's the whole point but i i just it's	2275	B
i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
oh	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven't watched um	2275	B
i think uh yeah i think so which in Quantum Leap you get even though the the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets	2275	B
um he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that's i like that	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um i think my favorite show is Hunter and i i like the old series- series better when um	2275	B
Deedee was in there yes	2275	B
and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed	2275	B
yeah i didn't enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of Deedee and i think that's what they try to do but i think we wanted to see Deedee there or somebody like her	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
uh-huh	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
the second lady uh-huh yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
they didn't yeah she would go her way and he would do his and i think that's what i didn't like	2275	B
and	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
right	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
and i like the new lady better but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there i'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants i don't know but i just	2275	B
i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what i always enjoyed about it	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
just go ahead and quit the wondering and and	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
uh-huh	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
oh	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
i didn't	2275	B
i was going to say i didn't ever watch Moonlighting but i heard that's what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
right	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
halfway through	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
oh	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
i i'm guess it's going- falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows	2275	B
yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i don't enjoy because of that	2275	B
but	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
i've seen it before but i don't watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights i'm out so	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah it's funny how we uh	2275	B
we we romanticize people uh like well- for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance uh	2275	B
romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care anymore or something like that and i think it's the same with your characters on TV	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
probably yeah i know it affected me when i was younger i'm not into rock stars too much lately but	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
um-hum	2275	B
it would have been hard wouldn't it	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
i i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place so	2275	B
having twenty million people watch you do that	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
yeah i think we've covered our time it's been good talking to you	2275	B
	2275	B
oh you're the first man i've talked to everybody else has been a female so this is a change	2275	B
<silence>	2275	B
you've had a little bit of variety huh okay well thanks so much bye-bye	2275	B
	2275	B
{alrighty} ladies first	2266	A
<silence>	2266	A

<silence>	2266	A
yeah well- my wife we have a new one in the house and she's she's stays home too also	2266	A
um i guess i have a wide variety i like watching the TV for things that are interesting not so much the the boring- the uh	2266	A
the things that aren't for example like the Cosby Show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time and and Different Strokes and	2266	A
but i like Sixty Minutes Prime Time Live um course i have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning but not the Ninja Turtle ones i like the old-timey ones Tom and Jerry	2266	A
there you go	2266	A
<silence>	2266	A
-that's right Johnny Quest you know the good ones um now i'll if i'm ever home during the during the day on a vacation day i'd i have to catch at twelve o'clock the Andy Griffith Show because_1 he's just you know he's one of my idles and then uh	2266	A
but i don't know it just seems like that nowadays	2266	A
everything's so electronic you know and- magnified and and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings and- and so uh	2266	A
uh now i do with- the Cosby Show	2266	A
i have seen it a couple of times and- and i do	2266	A
i i like the show i just don't watch it because of the timing but uh some of the crap that's on TV nowadays and	2266	A
it's bad i do watch the special shows that they come out with the- the Nova stuff and and the nature shows	2266	A
but um i think there's enough out there to pick from i'm not we don't have cable to the point of of of the HBO or any of that stuff and but uh yeah	2266	A
<silence>	2266	A
um-hum	2266	A

yeah i had watched it i had watched it since it started so it was kind of but now i'd you know i -didn't know who the characters are and um i'll turn it on every once in awhile don't recognize anybody so i guess that's a good sign	2266	B

	2222	A
so what's your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
Bengals	2222	A
yeah	2222	A
uh i was- uh i was pulling for the Bengals when they uh lost the Super Bowl	2222	A
	2222	A
two years ago was it	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah i- i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didn't want 49ers to win	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
anybody who plays the 49ers really	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah that's true uh my favorite team is are is are the Raiders	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah i mean i've liked them ever since the season that they won the Super Bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was	2222	A
and uh i pretty much like them ever since that	2222	A
and they haven't they haven't produced since then but	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
but	2222	A
least i've stuck with them i'm loyal	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah what other teams uh do you like up there	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
or do you not watch much football	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
oh really	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
every Sunday and Monday	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
oh that's right	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah me neither it's kind of like they they gave me the topic and i'm like football jeez it's been a long time	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
did you know that they're playing a game today	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
they're playing it right now	2222	A
yeah i think it's uh ABC that's carrying it it's either ABC or NBC one or the other i think i'm not too sure one of the major stations it's uh Barcelona versus New York	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah the temperature's just not right	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
we usually don't uh we usually don't have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season	2222	A
but it takes a good while for it to get cold	2222	A
but couple couple Christmases ago we had a a freak storm	2222	A
and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina	2222	A
and uh what they they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it it snowed only on the coast but not inland	2222	A
so the coast was completely we had like ten foot snow drifts which in the coast we barely get an inch of snow a year	2222	A
yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else	2222	A
and this time we had a bunch of snow we we i had fun playing in in the snow playing football in the snow	2222	A
and so i mean i- i had never done that before and it's it's so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesn't matter because it's snow and yeah	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow	2222	A
yeah	2222	A
but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn't really feel it	2222	A
you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but it's it's a lot better to play it in the cold weather that's true	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
well right now we're having nice weather i- i probably say in in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah especially at this time	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah is it very windy up there now	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and they've been up been with us all day	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
well	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah this is the first time i've talked with someone up north really mostly i've been talking with people in Texas	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
yeah nice talking to you too bye	2222	A
<silence>	2222	A
	2222	A
	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
well i uh i'd have to say my favorite team would be Cincinnati Bengals	2222	B
um-hum	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
oh that was sad wasn't it	2222	B
yeah yeah yeah that was just a couple of years ago	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
yeah well uh it's kind of hard to uh to know what to do with some of these teams and they're either extremely strong or very very weak and uh nothing much in between	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
oh you like the Raiders	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
um-hum	2222	B
uh-huh	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
no	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
uh-huh well that that and that's the important thing i mean whether they win or lose why the fun is is in the supporting them	2222	B
and staying with it and hoping that uh you know the next time is a better time around	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
well um	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
oh i love football	2222	B
oh watch it uh every- every game that's on i watch uh	2222	B
yeah and Thursday nights	2222	B
	2222	B
no there uh	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
well let's see i never use thought about football too much yet uh	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
yeah right uh uh	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
yeah that's the World League	2222	B
yeah what time is that supposed to be	2222	B
oh are they	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
oh	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
hum well uh	2222	B
i haven't for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer from- from the the the World League	2222	B
yeah yeah and uh it just seems like it should only be done in cold weather	2222	B
rather than just be played at anytime- anytime during the year	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
um-hum	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
huh	2222	B

<silence>	2222	B
	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
is that right	2222	B
huh	2222	B
i would think uh that if you were real cold and you hit uh hit the ground that it would seem to hurt more	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
well that helps doesn't it	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
oh yeah	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B
	2222	B
<silence>	2222	B

yes and uh this morning why it was raining and it was quite cold and then it seemed to warm up somewhat and then before uh before i got out of church it cooled off again	2222	B
so much so that i uh stopped at home to change coats because i had to go down to the hospital and uh the coat i had on was just too light in weight	2222	B

<silence>	2220	B
um-hum	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
uh-huh so you like a a variety sort of easy listening because_1 you- you like country but then	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
um	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
oh uh-huh yeah i- i like some of his songs though they're they're not so	2220	B
they're not so sad country all the time they're just kind of sweet sometimes you know i mean they're not the- the typical country where they're just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know	2220	B
yeah my truck's broken down and my house just burned down you know but	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
no	2220	B

 yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be	2220	B
that'd be kind of fun i think	2220	B
 because_1 i mean i play the flute and	2220	B
not many things you can play that'll you know people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so	2220	B
but um i like a lot uh i like classical music just because of the when- when i i don't play i like jazz music but	2220	B
what's that	2220	B
what's that	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah i like a lot like i like uh the- the New Age music like with um uh the um um i don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah i love those too they're just so relaxing	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
isn't that nice i mean it's nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know and uh	2220	B
it- it- it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting but it uh it's mostly relaxing and you don't uh because it doesn't have words you know you don't feel like	2220	B
 there's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or but uh	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah oh okay i see what you're saying yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
	2220	B
course i- i like classical music and uh	2220	B
i was in the band yeah so and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff so	2220	B
i'm used to pieces i- and- and i played classical flute i didn't play play jazz flute or anything like that so i can- i can relate to it i suppose but uh	2220	B
and i like i'm like you i like the older stuff too because_1 i like Chicago and i like i like um uh	2220	B
let me think who	2220	B
um i like Hebert um oh you don't know Hebert Laws but Hebert Laws is a flute player he's a jazz flute player and i like um	2220	B
uh Chuck Mangione do you know who Chuck Mangione is yeah i like Chuck Mangione i'm trying to think of all um	2220	B
uh what's his name plays the trumpet	2220	B
um	2220	B
yeah yeah i like Moody Blues i- i like mostly the older groups i think	2220	B
oh but we do have i like Simply Red we got Simply Red i thinking of all our CD's that we have what i really like and uh	2220	B
i like Breeze i like the group i think just because_1 they all sort of sound they sound like- a lot like red- uh Simply Red if i'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays that's it's easy in listening	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
um	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
no it's it's got people singing but it's it is instrumental but it's it's got people singing but it's got a like a whole bunch of people singing you know um <b_aside> how many people are in <e_aside>	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
on he can't hear me i- i don't remember how many people but it's it's got men- men and women and it's not	2220	B
it's it's nice i mean it's pleasant you know music it's not what's it hurts your ears to hear it but it's not as it's not like uh Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it	2220	B
you know it doesn't have like all the brass and everything	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
oh you must live in this area	2220	B
we're in Sherman	2220	B
oh okay you're going to Commerce for East Texas or something oh okay	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
oh okay well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas that's why i was just wondering yeah East Texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester and they're they've been doing a lot of that in the area	2220	B
 no more huh	2220	B
well right now i'm just a homemaker but i'm going to school uh for legal assistant and that's why i know so and uh just nothing basically	2220	B
no no it- uh no i don't go to East Texas uh i got a degree from TWU but i'm really interested in legal you know in the legal environment but i don't want to be a lawyer so i said well i think i'll go back to school and	2220	B
see about being a legal assistant so	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
oh uh-huh	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah that's how it works	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
and this is the man that was in front of you oh well they'll weed him out	2220	B
yeah	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
uh-huh	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
well not necessarily but there's probably something else that might make you because_1 you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jury- the jury	2220	B
you i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and- and know some of the different things about it but um	2220	B
they- they might weed you out some other way you know if you if you don't believe like if this was a capital crime and- and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all so but	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
yeah so see there there they would have a doubt about you that- you know because_1 if that's what if that's what the punishment is in that in that instance then you're always going to say	2220	B
you know not guilty- you're- you're not going to want to have them have that crime- uh that punishment so	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
uh-huh	2220	B
<silence>	2220	B
well especially with something where you have to find- you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt you have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like do you really feel that sure about	2220	B
 i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music and they're none of them are recent right	2220	A
so i like Gordon Lightfoot do you know who he is and the Moody Blues and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot and Willie Nelson	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
but not all country i don't like that when they start i don't know i just like Willie Nelson i guess because_1 he's such a character	2220	A
	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
 my truck is broken down	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah and there there's a guy have you ever heard of George Winston he plays piano i think he's dead now but he plays wonderfully	2220	A
i like that	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
very badly i've got a piano my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons	2220	A
	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
oh so do i forgot about that i said so do i i forgot about jazz	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yes we've got about five of those i love them	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
uh-huh i'd never heard them_1 before until i went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece and it was just so wonderful and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
i mean you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can just- see the things that they're trying to show with music my my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the the people that have written certain songs and he buys the	2220	A
the pieces that have that person	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
you know on it huh i mean i don't even know who did which ones but he does	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
were you in the band	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
so was i	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
i like the Moody Blues	2220	A
did you like them	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
so what type Simply Red i've never heard of that	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
is it just instrumental	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road we're going to go to Commerce and see a friend and then i'm going to go to Sulphur Springs yeah where are you	2220	A
okay so we're in Garland	2220	A
 yeah	2220	A
yeah yeah just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
for colleges	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
well they're not colleges-	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
they're not going to recruit me anymore i'm through no more for me what- what do you do	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
are you going to go to East Texas for that	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
that'd probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial	2220	A
this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three	2220	A
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire we stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until June	2220	A
and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summoned i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed	2220	A
well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman	2220	A
this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh	2220	A
getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
the- the investigator yeah he he got off right away and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that so i figure that that will make me biased and i won't be chosen	2220	A
hopefully	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
the death penalty	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
no i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody	2220	A
 you know	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
uh-huh	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
yeah but then when you're uh when you're picked see i was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and it's so hard because you know	2220	A
everybody is wanting to go on and- and get the sentence done and if you're trying to hold out you know there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision	2220	A
<silence>	2220	A
	2268	A
what kind of fishing do you enjoy	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
so you like fresh water	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
uh-huh	2268	A
oh i see	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
well i was raised on the Texas Gulf Coast in the summers and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast	2268	A
and so i thought fish came out of the ocean	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
and anything that was fresh water was muddy	2268	A
so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties	2268	A
so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun	2268	A
there's so many different ways to catch fish you know at night you can	2268	A
go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isn't technically fishing but it's a lot of fun	2268	A
so i- i grew up fishing	2268	A
what area lakes do you like	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
oh i see	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
Lake Caddo or something like that	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
if it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
i would love to do that but they have snakes over there	2268	A
and i'm not too	2268	A
welcome around i don't i really don't want to share a boat with a snake	2268	A
i just i- i i don't see it	2268	A
i just i don't i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something i'd make some quick arrangements	2268	A
and i've heard so many stories about the snakes	2268	A
you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that that i'm just	2268	A
i don't know what's the largest fish you ever caught	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
on a lake yeah on a lake- on a lake that's not a bad size fish	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
i've never done that	2268	A
i've i've seen it	2268	A
uh and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh	2268	A
it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways you know when you live down there	2268	A
it's not a treat	2268	A
it's what you do every day you know	2268	A
uh one of my favorite things	2268	A
was we were forever catching crab and steaming them	2268	A
you know out on the on the beach	2268	A
and you know just uh pitching them out on uh	2268	A
on uh	2268	A
what am i trying to say newspaper	2268	A
and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that's it	2268	A
and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left	2268	A
so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
no	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
no no i live in Dallas	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
i lived in Dallas	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
we had a house in Port Aransas	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
it's a little fishing village that is	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
corpus	2268	A
well	2268	A
uh South Padre is on down the bend	2268	A
it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region	2268	A
small island	2268	A
uh	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
oh okay	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
was it bad	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
oh i hate to hear that	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
huh-uh	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
no no no	2268	A
you went to Galveston uh	2268	A
i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water	2268	A
the uh what is it the Flagship	2268	A
is it still there	2268	A
i like that place	2268	A
	2268	A
i didn't realize that had happened for some reason	2268	A
	2268	A
well of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it	2268	A
huh-uh swimming is for swimming	2268	A
pool that's why they call them swimming pools	2268	A
that's where you swim you do not swim in the ocean	2268	A
no	2268	A
i've seen what comes out of the ocean and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that	2268	A
but really huge sharks are down there i mean	2268	A
incredibly large sharks	2268	A
uh some of the young	2268	A
dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night	2268	A
it was incredible the size of them that we would see on the the next morning they would have them strung up across the	2268	A
and it you know so if strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the uh just	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
kind of kind of nothing i won't have anything to do with	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
well it certainly was um	2268	A
maybe you can get how many have you had very many of these calls	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
how wonderful	2268	A
<silence>	2268	A
how wonderful	2268	A
maybe i'll be so lucky	2268	A
okay i enjoyed talking to you	2268	A
bye-bye	2268	A
	2268	A
<silence>	2268	B
well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat	2268	B
and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that's swimming	2268	B
because i've had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
uh-huh uh-huh i've never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing	2268	B
because you get i get sea sick but one of these days i'm going- hoping they'll have some kind of medicine so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing now that would be nice	2268	B
have you	2268	B
uh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
um-hum	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
oh my goodness	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
uh-huh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
wow	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
um-hum um-hum	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
oh i bet it is	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
um-hum	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
uh-huh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
uh-huh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
well uh now i haven't done much fishing here in Texas uh because_1 i moved from Ohio	2268	B
uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east	2268	B
in East Texas and do fishing and i can't remember what the name of the lake is	2268	B
and he was just here this past weekend i could have i- i think he mentioned it again but i couldn't remember what it was	2268	B
um i want to call it Salt Fork or	2268	B
Lake Fork i i can't remember but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
i you know that may be it that may be it and it	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yeah	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yeah yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and he's fished all over the United States	2268	B
in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen	2268	B
so i would love to go over there they were talking about going over there and some time this spring	2268	B
and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh	2268	B
and catch some bass	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yeah	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
uh-huh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yeah oh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yeah	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds	2268	B
and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big	2268	B
um so because_1 it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me	2268	B
yeah	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
no that's a good size fish	2268	B
	2268	B
uh-huh	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yeah	2268	B
um-hum	2268	B

<silence>	2268	B
okay okay	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
um-hum um-hum	2268	B
yeah yeah i i've been to Port Aransas but it was when i was a child	2268	B
yes because i have relatives who live in Houston so when would go and we would go to Port Aransas or then on down to Corpus or further	2268	B
yeah like what your talking about because i was just wondering we went to Galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything i mean i was	2268	B
oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i don't think uh and yeah and that that's true um	2268	B
uh you know the the water was murky and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there	2268	B
 huh-uh no i wouldn't want to eat them you know so yeah	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
um-hum	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yes uh-huh	2268	B
it sure is yeah yeah it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but uh i don't i think it's lost a lot of it's appeal	2268	B
that then because of all the oil spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there it was	2268	B
yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool	2268	B
because the water was so awful and	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B
yeah yeah	2268	B
<silence>	2268	B

<silence>	2202	A
yeah i like- i like PBS	2202	A
uh PBS here you can't get it unless you have cable	2202	A
and that really upsets me because_1 i won't pay cable prices because_1 there's it's it's useless having cable i think	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
it's uh it's far too expensive and they don't have anything on there	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah exactly	2202	A
i've almost given in a couple of times and gotten it every time i get one of those special offers in the mail but	2202	A
i've avoided the temptation so far but i sure do miss PBS	2202	A
because_1 they they have lots of good stuff Masterpiece Theatre and mystery and nature	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A

uh occasionally down in Charlotte	2202	A
yeah it it's it's pretty good	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A

Esplanade and listened to the Boston Pops and	2202	A
they're good they're really	2202	A
oh really	2202	A

yeah and i always get stuck in the in the afternoon traffic	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
um-hum	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
well i tell you the way people are driving nowadays i'm surprised we're not killing more people than we are	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year	2202	A
um human factors	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
that's um well it's sort of difficult to explain it's	2202	A
it's industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the human- from the human factor standpoint how does it interface with the person using it	2202	A
and and	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah it that's very similar	2202	A
yeah very similar um	2202	A
uh specializing in the computer and you know uh interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of good stuff	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah this is uh sort of the same sort of thing that's why it's it was the uh professor who brought this thing in he'd gone to a conference	2202	A
down there and brought this thing up i yeah sure i'll do it	2202	A
why not	2202	A
hey if TI wants to give me five bucks a phone call that's okay	2202	A
you have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
um-hum	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
where's she at	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A

<silence>	2202	A
uh Charlotte oh what about	2202	A
quarter of a million	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
oh it's fairly good size i mean it's it's not it's not small but it's certainly small by Atlanta standards	2202	A
course everything's small consider- compared to Atlanta	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah my my brother and uh sister-in-law live there i like	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah Atlanta's Atlanta's a good city it really is uh you have to get used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty five	2202	A
but uh if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then you're okay	2202	A
but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in Duluth which is uh north of Atlanta well not north it's more east	2202	A
uh along I eighty five	2202	A
and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day	2202	A
i never managed to plan my departure right	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
oh yeah	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah yeah it's scary	2202	A
it's scary they they rival even uh Chicago on uh departure and arrival uh number of arrivals every day	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah oh it's a busy it's a busy place and they have amazingly few accidents there	2202	A
amazingly few	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
because_1 uh i mean if you're flying anywhere down here you always go through Atlanta you can't avoid it	2202	A
it's the hub city	2202	A
and uh God	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
um-hum yeah	2202	A
yeah that's super it's getting even better too	2202	A
yeah they they just they never stop doing things to it	2202	A
all kinds of good stuff go	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah last well see i left there in uh eighty	2202	A
 what was it	2202	A
eighty six	2202	A
so it's been it's been five years for me	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah it just doesn't stop	2202	A
i mean it	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah	2202	A
yeah	2202	A
yeah	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
sure	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
yeah exactly	2202	A
couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i'm glad i didn't	2202	A
because it's really going downhill up there	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
well you know i- i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius	2202	A
and then i- i- i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential election	2202	A
because it certainly wasn't sustained	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
well	2202	A
yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn't a good system anyway	2202	A
you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him	2202	A
you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything	2202	A
hopefully	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
no that's true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking	2202	A
so	2202	A
<silence>	2202	A
 yeah well you can't	2202	A
you can't trust legislators anyway	2202	A
	2202	A
yeah we need- we didn't talk too much about music but we had a good conversation	2202	A
	2202	A
<silence>	2202	B
i like all kinds of music actually	2202	B
i'm kind of partial to country western i like that	2202	B
and i like mood music like you know when i'm in the mood for that i like semi-classical	2202	B
the real classics i'm not as familiar with as you know the ordinary sounds that you hear every day type of thing	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh that's fantastic	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
well we have a similar um radio station here	2202	B
and because of the uh people i guess being pressured to have advertisers	2202	B
you know a lot of the stations have to have advertisers they kind of like	2202	B
compromised	2202	B
and they do some of it at like certain hours but it's not always at a time when you can you know sit down and listen to it so	2202	B
you you kind of get trapped into listening to whatever there is available type of thing you know	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
we have that on TV we have two public uh broadcasting systems uh channel two and thirty six	2202	B
also that are publicly supported and they have excellent programming	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah yep same thing	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
it is it's expensive	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
no and the the problem is that they can do it at will you know like up the prices	2202	B
and you're if you have it you just have to pay it	2202	B
you know that's the hard part	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yep	2202	B
see we have cable here	2202	B
and almost everyone here has cable	2202	B
and it it's uh it's good because_1 you don't need the outside antennas with your TV and stuff and it gives you a lot more um	2202	B
of the other you know of the widest uh uh television that's available to you	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
yeah that's what i like	2202	B
yep right and i love that	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
 do you go to the theatre for for music uh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
have you been to the opera ever	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
oh that's nice	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
i've seen Man of La Mancha and uh a few of those you know that in Boston and uh i enjoyed it thoroughly i really did	2202	B
i've seen a few musicals and i uh go to Atlantic City once in a while and i always like to catch some shows when i'm there	2202	B
especially like when they have special singers and things and La Cage au Faux that was excellent	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh wow	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
well we're only about two hours from there yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
no	2202	B
right in fact i	2202	B
	2202	B
isn't it awful	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh yeah i- i think that the commute to to and from work has to be the worst horror show	2202	B
because_1 even the breakdown lane is used for a passing you know a travel lane in the morning	2202	B
and that's really i think that's a very serious thing you know i'm surprised they haven't had more you know really fatal accidents out there doing that	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh i know it's true it's true	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
so what are you majoring in	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh and and what is that	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh i see	2202	B

<silence>	2202	B
oh oh oh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B

yeah yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
	2202	B
really	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B

and uh she's been down there a couple years and she really loves it	2202	B
i don't know the city	2202	B
all i know is it's down in in North Carolina in fact the last time she was up i meant to ask her	2202	B
you know what city she was in i didn't but she said it's really nice	2202	B
	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
no	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh wow	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
really	2202	B
what's the population	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh that's that's pretty good size though	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
i- i liked Atlanta too i have a sister-in-law that lives in Atlanta	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
they she uh she in fact went from Massachusetts to uh Florida then to Atlanta and she really really likes it	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
um-hum	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
oh yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
	2202	B
the airport's something down there	2202	B
oh my God i- i swear those planes going or coming going or coming	2202	B
it is it's um	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yes	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
unbelievable-	2202	B
in fact when we went down to visit one time we just sat there and we watched i couldn't believe	2202	B
the traffic	2202	B
it is	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
i know isn't it	2202	B
unreal	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
yep yep	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
i went there to to visit the Underground when that was you know the Underground City	2202	B
and i thought that was really neat	2202	B
that amazing	2202	B
oh really	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
is that right	2202	B
course i haven't been there in about uh eight years	2202	B
so	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
five years	2202	B
the the growth in that place is phenomenal	2202	B
they don't stand still that's for sure	2202	B
we're having our problems out this way with the banking crisis and	2202	B
credit unions and all that kind of good stuff	2202	B
and it's starting to effect you know the economy	2202	B
because of uh the uh businesses that have their money tied up	2202	B
every place you go you know the	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
uh-huh	2202	B
yeah yeah	2202	B
it has i don't know what they're going to have to do to boost it but they need to do something quick	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
sometimes i wonder though if the presidential election isn't what really did everything in	2202	B
because he wasn't really paying attention to business you know	2202	B
you can't do both things well	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
no true but uh	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yeah	2202	B
that's true	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
yep that's true	2202	B
yeah somebody has to watch the store though you can't really you know without overseeing	2202	B
<silence>	2202	B
sure sure	2202	B
look at what happened just in Washington alone God	2202	B
it's mind boggling	2202	B
	2202	B
 no	2202	B
well it's been interesting talking to you	2202	B
but oh yeah right i hope to hear	2202	B
<silence>	2241	B
well uh pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
well uh we just bought our house uh last July and it's it it the house is forty years old so there's there's an established lawn and what not flower beds things like that but they've uh they've gone a few years of neglect	2241	B
so we're in the process of uh revitalizing the whole situation we've got	2241	B
um different flower beds in front and uh a window box a built in window box um	2241	B
trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up uh get rid of a few weed problems and things like that	2241	B
so	2241	B
uh i live in Dallas	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
okay	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
um-hum	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
i'll bet	2241	B
i'll bet	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
right	2241	B
right	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah it's pretty high alkaline- well- actually- actually it's done uh it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in uh Kessler Park area	2241	B
and uh we've got about	2241	B
yeah we've we've got maybe- maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil and then it's solid rock from then on down so	2241	B
yeah it's uh a little aggravating we can't we can't put in anything too big	2241	B
um as far as uh shrubs and things like that because_1 they've got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock	2241	B
but uh	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah it is it's it's solid limestone	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
uh you just we're just happy that there's trees already there so far um anything like that is is	2241	B
a uh major undertaking i guess uh sprinkler systems or anything uh start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
but uh and it you know not not even	2241	B
consider considering a pool or anything like that that's that's practically has to be blasted in i guess	2241	B
but uh and it makes it makes for a a different challenge i've never well i- i moved to Dallas about five years ago and uh	2241	B
i never really messed with anything uh gardening or anything like that until now but uh i- i keep hearing all the stories of of different parts of town	2241	B
in fact uh we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that	2241	B
and the first thing the the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in	2241	B
because_1 he said uh i've got i've got a dozen different varieties and	2241	B
each one works in one part of town and that's it	2241	B
that's basically what he was trying to tell us	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah it	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah that would in fact we put in some uh some more roses yesterday	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
uh different uh a few different uh hybrid tea type varieties yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
okay	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah that's we that's what we're searching uh we've got we've got all the different lake editions around the house and we're we're kind of experimenting right now we do we've got the direct sun in front and the backyard has two	2241	B
great big uh spruce and and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall so the backyard is just complete dark all day long	2241	B
and uh we're we're struggling to find something for those areas	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
no they're they're in pretty good condition	2241	B
uh we've been we've been pretty lucky on that	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
uh-huh	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
uh-huh	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
that's true that's true	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
it's uh bermuda	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
okay	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
right	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
okay	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
um-hum	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah it's uh there's such a there's such a difference through the year uh	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
uh-huh	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
uh-huh	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
 that's it	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
oh wow	2241	B
um-hum	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B

<silence>	2241	B
yeah	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B

okay	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
um-hum	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
okay	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
oh okay	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
sure	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
uh-huh	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
wow	2241	B
that really is it it would it seem like it be just the opposite when you get	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
um-hum	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
um-hum	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah that's true	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yeah that's true	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
that's true	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
um-hum yeah that's something i've been uh	2241	B
been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year	2241	B
and you know we're trying to decide what what to what to put on one side of the house and things like that but there's so many things that they they last for just a couple of weeks and then it then it's just a a bush there from then on	2241	B
it's kind of it's kind of disappointing	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
um-hum	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
yep	2241	B
<silence>	2241	B
okay um what do you do this weekend	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
hum which is what- do- what do you plan have planned for your yard	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
um-hum	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
hum what part of the state do you live in	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
oh okay	2241	A
okay my wife and i we live in Dallas too	2241	A
um	2241	A
yeah just what that area we're planning on moving to Flower Mound and we're going to be getting some	2241	A
wheel we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there	2241	A
seems like it uh the place we've been living at it's uh we're we're just leasing in	2241	A
the in Plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content	2241	A
that uh uh i went to use my {dad-in-law's} tiller and it about tore my arms off the sockets	2241	A
	2241	A
i mean just just scratching two or three inches was just a chore	2241	A
it was it was	2241	A
and then when it gets wet you know you don't even want to get out in the yard	2241	A
it's horrible	2241	A
it's a nightmare but um	2241	A
i don't know what what i- um where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ass content or	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
yeah yeah	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
i know right where that's at	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
um-hum	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
really	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
golly	2241	A

<silence>	2241	A

<silence>	2241	A

<silence>	2241	A
oh yeah	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
oh yeah we tried- we tried planting tomatoes last year and it they they turned out pretty poor	2241	A
i just i wish- i just wish i'd known the the variety and everything but but	2241	A
it it's amazing we also have roses and i mean they just grow so beautifully	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
um what um what type roses	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
oh hybrid teas	2241	A
yeah we we have a few uh of the real short stem they're kind- they're kind of like the bush roses but uh	2241	A
i don't know i think it's i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a it's a really old bush and	2241	A
but i- i i'm i'm amazed because the sun is so intense and the roses just seem to survive just fine there	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
um-hum	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
and uh	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
yeah have you have you uh done a done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
yeah	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
yeah just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath	2241	A
that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees we have a plum that's just about ready to go so we may just be	2241	A
getting rid of that but but our peaches they they seem to be doing just fine but they they really need pruning it it just seems like they that	2241	A
that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the the way they behave	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
i don't know	2241	A
but uh	2241	A
but uh what kind of uh what kind of what kind of grass are you growing	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
bermuda	2241	A
yeah	2241	A
oh i've i've been trying uh uh a mixture of uh the bermuda and the rye	2241	A
and but i may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather	2241	A
it seems that uh bermuda's bermuda's fine but um it looks like it would hold the soil but it really doesn't	2241	A
a lot of a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well	2241	A
but uh but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime	2241	A
but uh but boy once it gets over seventy seventy five degrees that it just dries up shrivels up and dies	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
but	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
yeah	2241	A
my my parents-in-law they're they're building a house into the side of a hill um well it's already been built and everything	2241	A
they've been living there for about three months now but uh this is out in west Texas but the the wind there has been so bad that	2241	A
	2241	A
	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
but it's	2241	A
but it's quite an undertaking they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property	2241	A
on a on the side of a hill it's beautiful i mean you can see the house from	2241	A
you know miles away but it's you know	2241	A
it's a pretty neat little job but they save a lot of they save a lot of energy but	2241	A
just uh you know for them i mean they they're going to have to start gardening it's going to be from the ground up	2241	A
i mean the whole way	2241	A
	2241	A
	2241	A
it's amazing i mean they have have the all they have are mesquite- uh mesquite and cottonwoods	2241	A
and uh it's it's all on Lake Greenbelt that property out there and uh	2241	A
i don't know that what they have they have all the water they want they can they can actually they can pump water i mean they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore	2241	A
but uh	2241	A
that's for like an additional they have to pay like some kind of fee per year	2241	A
but uh	2241	A
they're uh right now though i think they're just they're trying to get the trees planted and everything	2241	A
but man i- i just think of all of the money that they that they're going to have to spend just getting that	2241	A
but the taxes alone there Lake Greenbelt and some places they they they really they over tax	2241	A
and i mean your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes	2241	A
it's it's it's ridiculous	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
yeah no no it's not it's because even though it's far out there it's just that Lake Greenbelt you know they have to	2241	A
they they try to do it just from the selling the water but um	2241	A
the water usage you know they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it	2241	A
people still use it enough in like in towns like Clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate	2241	A
they huh they they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming but the irrigation- irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years	2241	A
but	2241	A
i don't know i just came back from there and just the air is so dry i don't see how anything can survive out there	2241	A
 for long periods of time should say my father-in-law says the mesquite trees is are	2241	A
they're they're they're pretty smart they're smart they're about the smartest tree around they don't they don't even start growing until May may or April	2241	A
like after it's been raining for a few months they say the roots have developed so that's all they work on just a leafy they don't do anything	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
um-hum	2241	A
<silence>	2241	A
i- i know my my wife and i we planted on the	2241	A
on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias and they did real fine during the summertime it's just	2241	A
but during the fall when it stopped when uh the rain let off just a little bit it i mean it just dried up	2241	A
and uh so i guess it these plants they just they don't it's like they remain	2241	A
	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
okay you want to go first	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yeah sure is	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yeah it is	2298	A
of course you you've you've had your fair share of that down your way too	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
no argument here yeah i- i think that uh now i'm i'm no financial expert but from what i've read and heard	2298	A
yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make	2298	A
uh riskier	2298	A
uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil- when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that	2298	A
without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
well also in investments- investments in oil ventures as well because it was predicted- predicated on uh a certain price per barrel	2298	A
to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to	2298	A
twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yeah	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yeah yeah	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yep	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
didn't didn't they just uh put another another thirty billion dollar Band-Aid on the problem last week or something uh	2298	A
President approved some more money to bail them_1 out	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
well that's true	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation	2298	A
and uh at some point in time	2298	A
it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off	2298	A
i'm not sure which which one is which i- i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yeah now i i'm a staunch Republican but uh you know for the last nine years i've heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt	2298	A
and after the longest sustained economic recovery in in i don't know how many decades it didn't happen	2298	A
and uh	2298	A
i don't know what it's- what it's going to take to turn that around	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yeah i think ending the the Gulf War quickly was beneficial	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
definitely	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
uh do we think enough is being done to address it i	2298	A
i- i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i don't i don't remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
right right	2298	A
sure	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
that's true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the Persian Gulf	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
maybe now uh that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to to address this in more depth	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
sure	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
well hey it's been real good talking with you	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
oh	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
what's- what's the	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
yeah	2298	A
what's the minimum is that like three minutes	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
oh okay	2298	A
<silence>	2298	A
i- i think so too	2298	A
you bet bye-bye	2298	A
	2298	A
	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
well uh topic being the banking crisis uh that's a real hot topic	2298	B
real real mess i guess you must say	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
oh yeah think uh	2298	B
probably i guess it's pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think Texas probably uh	2298	B
suffered and or caused the uh	2298	B
the major or a good portion of it	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
that makes two of us	2298	B
	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the	2298	B
the major culprit um with the oil crisis	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
right	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
yeah i guess that was the immediate cause	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
uh shoot i don't uh i tell you one thing as far as the way they're handling it i uh	2298	B
i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers	2298	B
i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum	2298	B
and on the other hand i don't	2298	B
know whether they're doing enough in the way of uh you know redressing the situation and bringing the uh the real	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
you know the	2298	B
the presidents of the banks and those people that are uh really responsible to uh to justice on that	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
	2298	B
i'm not sure i didn't	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
yeah it's going to be uh	2298	B
it's uh your and my money that's doing that you know that's unfortunately	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
yeah	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
	2298	B
yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them_1 out of it	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
that's a good point they uh	2298	B
	2298	B
they got a little uh	2298	B
a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
uh-huh	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
uh let's see what were some of the other	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
other points she mentioned topic wise	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
it seems to me like they really haven't uh at least they haven't	2298	B
if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh uh not out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh	2298	B
panels or whatever you know committees or investigations	2298	B
nothing uh	2298	B
nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don't think	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
yeah	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
does tend to uh push that out of the front page	2298	B
	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
yeah this will be a first i uh usually end up getting uh told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that	2298	B
	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
yeah i think uh one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was uh ended by uh	2298	B
its capacity was short that day or something	2298	B
<silence>	2298	B
i don't think there is a i don't know if there is a minimum	2298	B
so i'm uh satisfied we covered the topic on this end	2298	B
nice talking with you	2298	B
bye-bye	2298	B
	2298	B
	2221	A
what do you think about um	2221	A
the way the criminal justice system handles trials	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
uh-huh	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
well i think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial or it's whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of	2221	A
you know and held over for trial	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah i don't know i- i think that uh i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked however	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it you- give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong	2221	A
or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
um-hum	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
it's not so much that i that	2221	A
i haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges what bothers me is that uh they really don't mean anything	2221	A
someone could be sentenced to thirty five years and yet you know the- the parole system uh it's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
no it's not	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
um-hum	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
oh i think they're all overcrowded	2221	A
they've uh i think i heard Fort Worth that uh	2221	A
they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded- they're not allowed to accept any new inmates now what are they supposed to do	2221	A
well no i mean they're not allowed to accept any new inmates	2221	A
so what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail you know	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
there	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
um-hum something that is working and i- i- i really like the system of house arrest	2221	A
where uh a someone's wear someone wears a bracelet	2221	A
like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor and they are not allowed i mean the- some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job they come home they have to be home by such and such a time	2221	A
they're instructed uh	2221	A
so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts	2221	A
and uh	2221	A
they can put a they usually install a video monitor in the house	2221	A
and when the parole officer calls to check on them they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it	2221	A
so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing and that's working rather well that's a good system that allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while	2221	A
they're	2221	A
you know paying back for whatever crime they've committed	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
oh yeah	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
well- something that i really don't understand is when someone goes to jail	2221	A
and they have a job in jail and they work	2221	A
that they should i and this may sound cruel but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes	2221	A
i mean they're in jail for crying out loud what do they need cigarettes for	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
um-hum	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
um-hum	2221	A
oh i think that's a wonderful idea	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
more than that more than that	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
i know	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
the thing that the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them they're working when they get out of jail they get handed all that money	2221	A
that really ticks me off i think that while they are in jail and they are working their wages	2221	A
should go like i don't know they could uh some percentage like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board	2221	A
 figured on um a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year	2221	A
and when they get out they should have uh i don't know you know some reasonable amount of money	2221	A
to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the State anything that they've earned while they're in prison	2221	A
should go back to the State except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
exactly absolutely that's the part that i really think we need to change	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
has nothing right	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
absolutely	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
um-hum i think it works much better if it's if it's the actual jury	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
um-hum	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
uh-huh	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah in some cases that- it- it would work that way in some cases it would work the other way	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
the jury would would slam them and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
uh-huh	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah i think that's probably a much fairer way	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
yeah	2221	A
it might be more it may- would be more work for the jury but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it	2221	A
<silence>	2221	A
the thing that i- i don't really like i- i don't know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that i've seen have been a	2221	A
	2221	B
well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers	2221	B
but you know it's pretty hard to try let's say	2221	B
the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income	2221	B
to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that i've served on are businessmen	2221	B
okay now they don't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars so he held up the seven eleven	2221	B
okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time so you know i think that it a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know you can't really do it	2221	B
ethnically you know but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer but then there's another thing that i disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve	2221	B
and i don't know why they do that do you have any reason do you know of any reason why they do that	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
okay i see	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
okay	2221	B
i don't know much about the Grand Jury how do you feel about the in Texas i noticed since i've been here in twelve years that they they break up the the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
well we know there's a few out there	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
um-hum	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah it's	2221	B
yeah would be pretty hard well i don't think you know i don't think that	2221	B
if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be	2221	B
and i think it's not only that it's a waste of our money we have to have a trial for this person then two weeks down the road we have to sentence- sentence	2221	B
excuse me set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again and that's more money spent	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
no	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
and it's not working either	2221	B
it seems that we have more and more repeat offenders i know i don't know how you all are there where you're at but where we're at now our jails are overcrowded we just built a brand new one two years ago	2221	B
and it's overcrowded	2221	B
so now they start turning them loose	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
they turn them loose	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
well the way it- it seems the way it's been working here's	2221	B
go ahead	2221	B
it seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence or five to life	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah they	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah and they	2221	B
they keep	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
all right	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
all right	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah it would allow the-	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah instead of being completely penned up	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
and that way it would give you know the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in Lubbock	2221	B
and that would give you know at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy or trying to see six or seven people	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
sometimes it's pretty messed up isn't it	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
um-hum	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
 well see and there's another thing about the justice system that i don't like and there's a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong i came from California	2221	B
and when you're in jail they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else in what they call a chain gang and they clean the city parks	2221	B
and they clean the city streets but you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day	2221	B
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much	2221	B
and they're not you know they're not doing anything to support themselves while they're there	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah well	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
um-hum see now i also believe in	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah to help	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own	2221	B
and something else that i would	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
and something else that i would like to see is is uh victim reimbursement	2221	B
you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail and they're working they're getting paid but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death or has nothing you know our our victims are victimized period and the law has no	2221	B
no uh	2221	B
regulations to deal with that they they know how to deal with the penal system and they know how to deal with the criminal but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
but it's	2221	B
but i sure don't i- i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself there that	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah because- well the- see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge but you know if if they figure there's	2221	B
maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge does- just doesn't care you committed this crime so i'm just going to throw the book at you whereas the jury may have a little	2221	B
shall we say sympathy you know he did this but you know why did he do this is there is there a basis for it	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah in some cases where the judge says okay i'll give you you know two to three years and then	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
well they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there they have to decide whether or not he's guilty and then they can sit in the- at the same time and decide what his punishment would be and you'd have more than one person's input on it	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
and you know we're supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence	2221	B
and a lot of jurors not that i know of but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he's guilty but i don't have to deal with it from here	2221	B
you know so the judge takes care of all of that	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
yeah it would uh serving- yeah serving on the jury would be definitely more responsible- you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person	2221	B
<silence>	2221	B
<silence>	2201	B
lead on	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
doesn't bother you	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
well we differ there	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
it bothers me	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i just feel like it's an invasion- invasion of my privacy	2201	B
you know i you know there's a lot alcohol for example	2201	B
i can go out and drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job	2201	B
than if i go out on Friday and	2201	B
i don't know say take- take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
not saying that i do but i'm just	2201	B
i think alcohol's a a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i- i feel like it's okay if there's if there's cause somebody's performance is you know indicates- indicates that they're	2201	B
they're obviously not all there they're	2201	B
you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them_1 down there and test them_1 but	2201	B
i think a lot of people are going to go out and	2201	B
you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of people i don't i personally don't smoke pot but a lot of people do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place	2201	B
and they're going to find they're going to go out and drink instead because they know that it's their job on the line	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
and uh	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
you know i've been i've come to work hung over in the morning and i know i'm worthless	2201	B
	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
but	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you	2201	B
but there's i think there's a there's a big difference between use and abuse and i do- do agree that drug abuse should be punished	2201	B
but if somebody's going to in their own home on their own time	2201	B
in such a way that doesn't interfere- interfere with their responsibilities	2201	B
you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
yeah yeah i do	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i think i think that's true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of people don't	2201	B
they they don't know how to	2201	B
use drugs for recreational purposes without	2201	B
it becoming you know a dominant force in their life	2201	B
i mean yeah it's it's you know it's easy for me to say i'm going to go out on Friday night and maybe	2201	B
you know i don't have to work till Monday and if i want to go out and and drink a little beer or do something and just dance a lot or whatever	2201	B
that's fine as long as i realize Saturday that in order to you know i'm going to feel like crap that's just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you don't get up and drink another beer to get over it	2201	B
and and unfortunately and i think cocaine's a a good example it's it's just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it	2201	B
you know you're you're always doing it	2201	B
i don't know	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i mean i- i work for TI so i don't do drugs you know	2201	B
right	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
it's too big a risk yeah	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
but you're without a paycheck during that time	2201	B
and i don't at least that's my understanding is even	2201	B
you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i was that i was told that uh	2201	B
somebody had uh some woman had	2201	B
had a cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband or maybe the other way around one of them_1 anyway had uh	2201	B
come down with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling	2201	B
and it's like you know i can't afford that kind of loss of income you know	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i mean i've always been yeah the first time so what i'll go explain myself and and	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
that's what you would think but i kind of i that's i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don't i don't know firsthand but that's what i heard was that it was just	2201	B
you know there there were no	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
oh yeah you know you've got the same exact thing yeah	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
well i think	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i don't know anybody personally either	2201	B
i do know a lot of people that you know do use drugs recreationally and there's such a big difference	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
yeah i- i don't know	2201	B
it's it's kind of i've also been	2201	B
you know known managers at TI i know one i guess i shouldn't make that a plural but uh	2201	B
who drank on the job had whiskey in his desk drawer and you tell me what's worse	2201	B
you know	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
yeah but	2201	B
everybody covers up you know it's the good old boy thing	2201	B
i don't know	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i don't think so they don't test for it i mean	2201	B
it's not illegal	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
well that's true	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebody's performance	2201	B
and i guess that there's the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt	2201	B
yeah but at the same time you know you're telling me that on some given day i'm going to walk in they're going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health center and	2201	B
you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i haven't and so	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
no see i was i've been working for TI for almost eight years	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did	2201	B
because you know it's what i can get away with and if i'm going to go on the weekends	2201	B
spend my money and you know i	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
if you don't drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and that's	2201	B
that's something you do when you're young and dumb i guess	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
you know	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i'm not as young as i used to be but i'm still	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
no i don't smoke i quit doing that and i've tried to quit drinking but it's	2201	B
the only thing left you know i quit doing drugs when TI said quit and it was no big deal you know it's like i wasn't	2201	B
a regular drug user	2201	B
but uh	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i- i understand	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i understand	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
i was around somebody today outdoors and they're smoking and it's like you know i smell it and i'm like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me	2201	B
get me in trouble	2201	B
so see it didn't use to bother me when i thought that you know if i come in there and they say	2201	B
okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some people that were smoking pot but i wasn't but you know it's the idea that	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
you can't but at least you've got a chance whereas if they say for six weeks you don't have a job because you tested positive	2201	B
that you know that's that's devastating how you know i can't live without my income for six weeks there's no way	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
exactly	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
so i don't know	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
yeah opposing viewpoints there	2201	B
i said opposing viewpoints	2201	B
for the most part	2201	B
<silence>	2201	B
<silence>	2201	A
okay	2201	A
	2201	A
um drug testing doesn't bother me	2201	A
no uh i've been drug tested twice at TI and it doesn't bother me	2201	A
uh	2201	A
	2201	A
why why does it bother you	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
i know i understand uh	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
well that's true i- i agree that there should be something done about people that drink alcohol because i'm sure that there's people that drink and come to work especially on a second shift or third shift	2201	A
so uh i agree with you there but it just uh and it and it probably is an invasion of privacy	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
do yeah okay	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
that's true	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
feel bad yeah i don't drink anymore but i can remember	2201	A
	2201	A
i can remember the you know there's nothing worse than a hangover i have to agree there nothing worse	2201	A
than a i can remember staying in bed a whole day from a hangover and not going to work but i that was years ago and i didn't work for TI so but you you know really and truly there's-	2201	A
there's nothing worse than a hangover and you're right and you cannot perform well	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
that's true	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
course through this i think that they've helped a lot of people also uh	2201	A
a lot of people have ended up going uh to treatment you know which is offered i think at most government places i know it is at TI do you work for TI	2201	A
okay well you know a lot of people have used that treatment and i center and that's probably been a good thing especially for cocaine abusers and stuff	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
the drug can use you	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
	2201	A
yeah	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
yeah	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
that's true	2201	A
that's true	2201	A
yep	2201	A
well	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
you can't i mean it and you you just run the risk of	2201	A
of of	2201	A
getting caught and of course the first time you get caught it's not that big a deal you have to go to treatment and that	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
oh i didn't know they took you off the job	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
wow	2201	A
who can afford that my God i can't afford to miss a day let alone six	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
now i would have thought if he'd have brought in the prescription- wife prescription and explained the situation that they might have let him off of that	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
they didn't	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
okay	2201	A
yeah	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
now see that i wouldn't agree with see see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit	2201	A
here and there too without you know if if it's a case like that because look how many people take their husband's or their wife's	2201	A
medication you know but that's a really good example	2201	A
yeah yeah and so i would think that either the doctor could get him off with that or or that they should listen	2201	A
i mean because_1 i- i just can't see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through because he took his wife's medicine that just doesn't sound right does it	2201	A
so it seems like they should be able to bend the rules oops excuse me a little bit	2201	A
on that but you but i don't know because_1 i don't know anybody that's had to go through treatment or anything so i really don't know	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
you know	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
ooh	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
oh that could have been his whole career down the tubes	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
so does alcohol show up in these tests	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
so so it wouldn't show up yeah well it's not that's true see there's the there it is right there it's not illegal	2201	A
and drugs are illegal so i guess if they made drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn't be going through this	2201	A
you know they wouldn't be testing	2201	A
which doesn't make any sense either because they say you know it has no place on the job and you can't work safely under the influence of drugs and stuff like that	2201	A
and so if it was made legal	2201	A
 that doesn't make it any safer on the job	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
get hurt yeah	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
 have you had to do it yet	2201	A
oh gosh i was one of the first ones to go i think	2201	A
the with the January that they started it up i got called	2201	A
so i was one of the first ones but but you- did you get tested when you got hired	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
okay so you were well i- i got tested before i got hired too so	2201	A
but	2201	A
hum	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
	2201	A
i'm not young anymore	2201	A
 i quit	2201	A
i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didn't smoke- i don't smoke i gave everything up	2201	A
so i guess i don't know what just old age i guess is why i	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
oh i have a lot of friends that just are uh smoke just you know occasional joint at a party or something	2201	A
you know and and i'm even afraid to be around it	2201	A
because i'm afraid what if it gets you know because_1 you can inhale it if if you're if a room full of it	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
into my bloodstream	2201	A
 yeah and with my luck there'd be the notice Monday you know go take your test and that would scare me	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
how can you prove it	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
no not many people could i go paycheck to paycheck barely	2201	A
so	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
well this has been interesting	2201	A
but	2201	A
<silence>	2201	A
huh	2201	A
sort well sort of i mean i- i agree with a lot of what you said	2201	A
 well my family moved to Texas about eight years ago my husband was raised here but i i have never lived here so um	2234	A
when- when we came back to Texas i i was really kind of excited there wasn't a state income tax and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things and all of that was new to me so	2234	A
i'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here than what i was accustomed to	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
well i lived in Missouri and then in Utah and then um and both places had pretty good state income tax	2234	A
and um we've always paid tax um you know on everything we purchased you know even food at the grocery store so	2234	A
i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries- groceries and	2234	A
 but i think i mean i i don't enjoy paying taxes and it's hard but um	2234	A
i think that's what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and excuse me and have	2234	A
and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess	2234	A
what i feel is that most people um they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like well there's some people who aren't paying their fair share	2234	A
and um that makes you feel bad	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
right and you know when um when last year the the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know i i didn't have anything against um Clayton Williams personally or anything but um	2234	A
it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone who as wealthy as he is didn't have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed he had didn't have to pay income tax and he thought well you know there's some people	2234	A
are living pretty pretty good life styles but they're not paying income tax and that's not fair to me and there's you know some people who uh are abusing	2234	A
the systems that we pay taxes to support and all of that makes us feel bad but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um i'm willing to pay the taxes because	2234	A
i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited and um i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy how do you feel	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
um-hum	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
um-hum	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
um-hum	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
um-hum	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
uh-huh	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
oh no	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
 uh-huh	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
um-hum	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
uh-huh	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
right	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
yes	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
um-hum	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
yes	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
well it is and um and sometimes i think um	2234	A
well for myself that the income that we have we're paid a certain salary but i think the employer keeps in mind	2234	A
this'll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think we're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way we're compensated	2234	A
um just by our society yet you know they don't pay you um	2234	A
what just what it would take and then if if you pay taxes on it you wouldn't have any money left over and and um but some of the people that make	2234	A
a great deal of money and everything um i wish that they would i guess because i'm not one of them_1 i wish that they would um you know realize that they	2234	A
they couldn't make this kind of money they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else	2234	A
in that even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they um they wouldn't be able to enjoy the	2234	A
uproots that and that so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it yes they've earned it and yes they've that's great they've you know had such great fortune here	2234	A
but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else	2234	A
um um i like Texas um not having the state income tax and i hope that	2234	A
because um you know that we've had enough industry here that i guess it is that why we don't the industry here is able to to um fund	2234	A
the state because_1 we have oil here and things i mean that's what i've always heard is that um	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
big boom	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
 yeah there's something about um the industry in the state that um there's enough i know we moved here from Houston and um the city had it's enough money it was really nice that they had uh	2234	A
but they began to cut back because of the oil problems but um you know they would have- have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community	2234	A
country club type things that the it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city and i really liked that	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
um-hum	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
yeah it's true and i'm you know like the the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri but um i'm	2234	A
i'm comfortable at least this year with we pay we have some good schools you know the school thing might be changing but	2234	A
i'm i'm- willing to pay for that for my children and i'm willing to sacrifice i guess i mean i'm not going to be the kind of person that's going to grumble about the taxes even though we're paying pretty high percentage um	2234	A
i feel like you get what you pay for and i want to be here and i i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country and having seen other countries i'd much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and	2234	A
and not anyway well i guess i better let you go	2234	A
yeah it was nice talking	2234	A
<silence>	2234	A
no no they just define it to you and so so you get what get uh luck of the draw but yeah anyway well good luck to you bye-bye	2234	A
	2234	A
<silence>	2234	B
um-hum	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah well- did you move from the the Northeast	2234	B
um-hum	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah i think- yeah it's the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
no	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and i think that you know i don't think there's probably any really	2234	B
put- that system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed you know i guess in Texas with uh we live here also	2234	B
and that it's mostly sales tax so it's really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff i've lived in Texas most of my life we um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and	2234	B
we were kind of in for a rude awakening they had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year we're there it was like eight hundred dollars and we're like	2234	B
	2234	B
a state income tax was also kind of tough too um i guess since we've been married we've moved a lot and so it always seems like	2234	B
you know we're always paying in taxes for something and so the- it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little bit of money back but	2234	B
i um have accounting background so then i also have done tax returns in the past and for other people when i worked for accounting firm	2234	B
and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the	2234	B
resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put their money in places they don't have to pay taxes or to buy something that loses money so that they can	2234	B
you know offset the income that they get or whatever so but you know i think if	2234	B
i can understand maybe why the rich people don't want to pay you know a large large percent because it- you know that's not really fair either if they've earned their money	2234	B
by themselves well you know people just kind of given the money it's kind of depressing sometimes i think	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
well yeah that's true	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
but they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that that really hasn't been the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes i wouldn't think	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
um-hum	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
don't you have to why people just kind of debate- expect certain services then then they don't really think they should pay for them_1 or something maybe i don't know	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
yeah	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
um-hum	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
 well it was nice talking to you i haven't ever i need to i've never initiated one of these phone calls do you call in do you get to pick the subject or do they kind of	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
 oh i see	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
 yeah	2234	B
<silence>	2234	B
okay you too bye	2234	B
	2234	B
	2224	A
okay pro football i like two teams one the New York Giants and the second is the Raiders	2224	A
that's right across the country i don't think i could i don't think i could	2224	A
i don't think i could spread my patriotism any more than well actually i like uh San Francisco 49ers too but uh	2224	A
yeah uh i'm surprised being that being from Dallas i thought you'd be a Dallas fan	2224	A
oh i see	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
uh-huh	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
i liked uh the Cowboys i lived in in West Texas in Abilene i worked with TI in Abilene for ten years and i really enjoyed watching the Cowboys play and they	2224	A
they went through a rebuilding thing down there and and and uh i watched them go downhill like all the teams do you know like Pittsburgh did like the New York Giants did like like i think the 49ers are about to do	2224	A
i think the the players get a little old and get a little tired and uh	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
sure	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
you're exactly right and and this the other teams failed to do Houston failed to do that they had Bum Phillips in there and a and a good running back i forget to uh i forget that fellow's name uh	2224	A
Campbell Earl Campbell and they run that man to death	2224	A
and	2224	A
yep but	2224	A
they had nothing to back it up and	2224	A
and uh you see that so much in pro sports we we go through this	2224	A
this rebuilding cycle without a without a backup bench and	2224	A
it's it's happened in basketball here with the Celtics and this year they finally gotten some backup support so you don't have to keep five guys out there for an hour you know	2224	A
but i like uh i like the Giants i- i kind of think they snuck into the championship this year this past year and and i'm not so sure they'll get away with it again but	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
they they kind of pulled it off this year but i like	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
yes	2224	A
yes	2224	A
i think the whole thing of how they got there was to me i- i kind of well i- i guess that's the rules and	2224	A
and the way the and the way the the play-offs are run but i	2224	A
i don't know i just think there was probably some other teams that they only missed by couple of points and they really should have been in there but	2224	A
i like the Giants because of uh Bill Parcells and i like him as a coach and he's he's been for years a a good coach i- i think	2224	A
i'm not sure that they can repeat okay	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
yeah yeah	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
no	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
no i don't think they'll be able to carry it that far uh	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
who who would you if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams who would you say is going to be the new new uh Super Bowl champions this year for ninety one	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
that kind of that kind of put you out on a limb a little bit i guess	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
i thought i thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i would- that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year	2224	A
because with Kelly at quarterback when he went down hurt they brought another young fellow in there	2224	A
yeah Reicher or whatever- Reicher whatever his name is and boy he they never even missed a beat i mean they just kept right on pouncing	2224	A
and if it weren't for the tumble of the ball Buffalo would have been there this year and and to me that's another super team course	2224	A
i'm being up here in the northeast corner i kind of like these northeast teams	2224	A
course i used to like the Patriots too they were just down the road from here but boy the Patriots are kind of sad they're now they're talking of moving out of town and they ought to all get out of town and take Kiam with them_1	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
but uh yeah they they really	2224	A
i think they hurt the sport this year with all that controversy over that locker room incident with uh with uh all that the reporter and stuff and	2224	A
i think they just could have handled it more professionally i- i- i believe that they they hurt themselves i guess	2224	A
they've had a lot of trouble with uh with the Sullivan boys and Kiam they didn't really see eye to eye and of course the the big political football up here you know now they're now they're trying to move the team somewhere else the last i heard	2224	A
boy just kind of	2224	A
i've been a Patriot fan for years and years and you know when you when they're only like thirty miles from where you live you can get to see the games once in a while and	2224	A
it's just a shame you keep going there and like week after week and every week you come away a loser i mean you- after a while guys get tired and we just didn't go anymore so	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
yeah sure	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
but they played like professionals exactly right	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
yeah	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
	2224	A
i think they need to get rid of Grogan he's been around too long they need to put him in the front office doing management or something but they need to get him off the field and and get the manager	2224	A
he is eventually	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
because he's been	2224	A
he's been hurt so many times and he's not as agile these young fellows they just take advantage of that and and and though they don't show it and say it and do it intentionally	2224	A
it's just their strength will beat him you know sometimes	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
sure of course no one does i'm sure they don't you know it was	2224	A
that that would be and the other thing is they're going to be there in that same position one of these days you know and hopefully they like Bo Jackson now as i understand has hurt himself in both baseball and football he he's there's question as to whether he's going to come back i haven't read today's paper	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
is that right there's a there's a fabulous career	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
	2224	A
anytime at all yeah but yeah- yeah he may come back into baseball but i doubt if he'll ever come back and play	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
well i would have too i that's the same- that's that's i don't understand that obvious i think football is much more strenuous than baseball	2224	A
you get a chance to sit down in baseball every once in a while you know if you're not up for three innings or whatever but	2224	A
	2224	A
some some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground you know i mean but uh i- that- that's surprising i- i was i had not heard that in the in the	2224	A
yeah they	2224	A
no i'm i'm sure they probably- well it all depends i guess on on what they feel is you know what he can do because_1 baseball is not a light an easy sport either that's a very very athletic sport lot of running and stuff like that and the hip	2224	A
may be a real problem but i- i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
well Steve i'll tell you i think i still think Joe Montana's the best quarterback that ever handled a ball	2224	A
and Terry Bradshaw i think is probably even better than he is or better or was- was better than than Joe Montana is now	2224	A
because_1 i of course another another Steeler fan showing up here you know another black and yellow surfacing up here you know this is the black and blue league up here in the corner	2224	A
but i like Bradshaw as a quarterback and i think uh Joe Montana's probably one of the finest and John Elway i believe that fellow if he had some different people in front of him	2224	A
he would be on par with	2224	A
with Joe Montana	2224	A
because i really think that Denver did not do much for Elway and his career except make him look bad on times when he really should not have looked that bad	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
yeah that's a fact i like John Elway i think he was a fabulous- he he still is he's got a he's got a lot of years left in him	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
no i don't believe so i don't believe he's going to be able to get the job done in Denver he's going to run up some big numbers and stuff but i don't believe he's going to get the job done there because Denver- simply because Denver is not not the	2224	A
doesn't have enough depth i don't think to support him like like Joe Montana got supported with the 49ers	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
yeah that's that could be true too	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
yeah yeah that in-fighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win	2224	A
yeah pardon me	2224	A
<silence>	2224	A
oh it certainly did it most certainly did yeah we as i say we went through the Sullivans uh that that owned the team you know and and owned the stadium and	2224	A
it's unreal the in-fighting it was it was just it's every day in the paper was like you know it was like a saga like a like a	2224	A
like a soap opera it you know who's fighting with who who doesn't want to go out on the field who doesn't want to catch it's unreal i mean you know that that's really detrimental to the team	2224	A
well Steve it's been nice talking with you	2224	A
it sure has and i i'd like to try this thing every once in a while i thought i'd give it a try this afternoon being so rainy i'm locked in up here anyway so	2224	A
well like i say i- i guess i'll root for any football game because i really like the sport and i'm glad that was my topic today so	2224	A
you uh you uh take care of yourself and if you're ever up this way to TI in Attleboro look me up my name's Ray Smith and i work in building twelve	2224	A
okay come on up bye-bye	2224	A
	2224	A
<silence>	2224	B
pro football-	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
okay	2224	B
yes	2224	B
that's one end to the other that's true	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah San Francisco i go with so	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well i'm not originally from Dallas so uh i kind of i moved around a lot when i was well up until last year and uh so i've i've kind of picked teams all over the country	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah i think that's true	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well the only thing that San Francisco may have done differently is that they've done a good job in the last few years of of getting rid of their older players and and bringing up new- a bunch of new people	2224	B
you know	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
right	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
Campbell Earl Campbell	2224	B
um-hum but it it worked for them_1 but uh you're right they they kind of	2224	B
exactly	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah that's right	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well i think i got to agree with you there	2224	B
they did a they had a excellent game in the Super Bowl uh i was real impressed but uh because_1	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well as hard as it is to repeat anyway uh and as as close as i think the New York Giants were to the rest i mean	2224	B
there really wasn't a a dominant team this year	2224	B
and uh you know if if if like San Francisco was dominant for two years uh they had a you know they had a chance to but uh i don't think New York's going to be able to do that	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
right	2224	B
they've got i mean they've got some excellent players uh	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
hum uh i might go with Buffalo- yeah	2224	B
you know this may be really out on a limb but i might go with Buffalo as as good as they were toward the end of the year got into the Super Bowl and just just missed	2224	B
think they'll be hungry next year	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
Reich uh Reich or yeah	2224	B
think it was	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
no	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
	2224	B
yeah i can believe that	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah well	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
	2224	B
yeah i think that's probably would be best for the area	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
oh yeah	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah well losing is i mean i'm i'm originally from Saint Louis and Saint Louis Cardinals when they were there were uh a mostly a losing team but	2224	B
they- exactly and and yeah they never they never did things to embarrass the town and that's what i think would be would be bad about New England	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum well that's true	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well he's going to he's going to kill himself	2224	B
he's going to end up paralyzing himself or something i mean i worry about that guy	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
oh yeah	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah well the only thing that might save him is that in the backs of their minds they may think that they don't want to hurt him permanently	2224	B
and so they may let up on him so i don't know	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
right right	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well the last i heard i didn't read it in the paper but i heard it on TV was that they were still saying that he's out permanently you know yeah	2224	B
yeah well they were they were talking- i think i was watching uh the NCAAs and they were talking about uh you know this is one reason they say that	2224	B
that athletes get the money as quickly as they can you know get all the money that- you know	2224	B
right and it could end at anytime	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
you know it was weird when i what i read in the paper was	2224	B
uh the	2224	B
uh	2224	B
the the baseball career was over permanently the football career might not be and i don't understand that i would have thought it was the other way around	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
especially yeah i mean	2224	B
yeah um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
and you don't get hit	2224	B
	2224	B
or you're not supposed to anyway	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
that's right	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
it it may have been a misquote but that's sure what i got	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
oh yeah	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah i was i- i was kind of surprised that uh that the Royals let him go with a football career as long as they did you know	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well that's uh i agree with you there i mean he didn't have the surrounding cast that Montana had there's no doubt about that	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
i don't think he'll do it in Denver though	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
i'm not even yeah	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
well i think it's it's not only depth i don't think that they've got the spirit or whatever to go out and get the people to support him i mean	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah the coaching staff seems i mean they were they were fighting each other coaching staff and Elway and	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
oh yeah that did it to New England a couple years ago didn't it	2224	B
didn't it do that to New England a couple years ago	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
um-hum	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
oh yeah	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah it has	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
yeah it worked out real good	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
you too	2224	B
<silence>	2224	B
all right i will	2224	B
all right	2224	B
you- you take care bye-bye	2224	B
	2224	B
<silence>	2260	A
 okay let's see i think uh i guess since i call i'm supposed to start i think that's the way everybody has done it so far	2260	A
but anyway i- i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that	2260	A
we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money	2260	A
um we're probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems	2260	A
um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i don't think uh	2260	A
anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a a couple of weeks because_1 they've been messing it up for many years now so yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
um-hum	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right i think it's seven here or seven point something	2260	A
 yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
um-hum right do where are you at what state	2260	A
oh really yeah there's we're still we still one of few that don't have the uh state tax taxes	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah that's true	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah- yeah i do i've lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
no no i've just lived here but	2260	A
i don't know i- i do i can think of all the uh	2260	A
the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i can't think of this the scripture Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's so	2260	A
you know even uh	2260	A
i think even in the the story where uh they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fish's mouth or in the fish's inside the fish	2260	A
and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right get in yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
oh sure	2260	A
sure	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right	2260	A
um-hum right	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah are	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
no not really i- i we've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year	2260	A
um i have been married for just a few years so i've had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular right all the deductions and all that	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah it really did i- i saw that too	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right right that's we're looking at buying a house and that's one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is	2260	A
yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
um-hum	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah yeah you know- there's a a thing i just i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it	2260	A
if- if you pay i- i know i get paid twice a month uh every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months	2260	A
so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying a	2260	A
uh one month extra every year and it'll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
oh yeah	2260	A
um-hum	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right and that's going on the principle it doesn't pay any interest or usually- usually it doesn't anyway	2260	A
yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
um-hum	2260	A
um-hum	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
right that's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty we're not going to go longer than twenty	2260	A
but we're taking our time we're going uh try to make our decision by July	2260	A
so and we just started like two or three weeks ago and we're not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most	2260	A
and	2260	A
yeah	2260	A
uh yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so that's	2260	A
i don't know we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now	2260	A
but anyway well um i can't think of a whole lot more to say	2260	A
yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife uh she went to uh the school out there in Lubbock um she was there for two or three years before we got married	2260	A
i guess before i even met her but	2260	A
okay	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
but anyway i just yeah she went to school there at uh Cathy Walker	2260	A
no yeah but she	2260	A
yeah thanks a lot you y'all work at TI you you do okay oh really wow that's interesting i work in the wafer- in the wafer fabrication- in	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
oh really yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
oh wow	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
 yeah	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah i'm i'm uh turning in a capital request right now yeah that's funny that's that's where you're from uh a machine that puts	2260	A
back grind tape on and off the wafers	2260	A
yeah i'm i'm sort of an acting process engineer but not officially but that's pretty much what i do yeah	2260	A
right and do most for	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
oh i like him he's um he's hard but i we i think we needed that	2260	A
and he's i mean he	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
um-hum	2260	A
<silence>	2260	A
yeah that's that's what he said here he's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before	2260	A
and that's that's been a real big plus and he's broadened our um the devices that we're making too	2260	A
which has made us as lot more stable but anyway well it was nice to talk to you and they're are going to interrupt us any minute now i can tell	2260	A
okay yeah me too you- well you too bye	2260	A
	2260	A
	2260	B
okay	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
well i have to agree that and and you're right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things	2260	B
that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they're mismanaged and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a	2260	B
i don't know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say i'll tax them_1 if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending	2260	B
um i don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a	2260	B
the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California	2260	B
and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
yeah	2260	B
yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about	2260	B
we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it	2260	B
so	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
 i'm in Lubbock Texas yeah	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
that's true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay	2260	B
know you don't sound like you're from Dallas where do you come- do you come from originally Texas or	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
oh okay	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there	2260	B
yeah	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
that's right	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
yeah	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would make him contradict himself	2260	B
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you know you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's you render unto God what is God's and uh	2260	B
and- you know of course there i don't think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something	2260	B
but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to	2260	B
you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know so i really do	2260	B
where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
schedule A well yeah and you know	2260	B
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder	2260	B
i didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and other things	2260	B
yeah	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles	2260	B
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
uh-huh	2260	B
uh-huh	2260	B
that's right	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
uh-huh	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
that's right	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
that's right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago	2260	B
and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that	2260	B
uh just because uh exactly what you said you're making one more months payment every year	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
yeah so that's	2260	B
that's a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
yeah	2260	B
yeah	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
well that's good though	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B
yeah	2260	B
<silence>	2260	B

<silence>	2280	A
really bad yeah funny weather but bad because_1 that means it either means one or two things it's going to be a bad summer or a not too good summer and a worse winter next year	2280	A
	2280	A
i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
that's right	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
no see that's it was a mild winter that's why i keep saying oh no	2280	A

<silence>	2280	A
yeah	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
um-hum	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with mosquitoes	2280	A
see	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
well see i would prefer the cold	2280	A
i'm from southern California	2280	A
but see the heat out here ain't nothing	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
no i don't want to get that cold now	2280	A
	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
i don't think no i don't want to go no where up north no where	2280	A
huh-uh	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
	2280	A
	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
that's right it's too cold up there	2280	A
and then last year that's when they really had that cold spell	2280	A
you know it was like um	2280	A
record breaking below temperatures and stuff in Alaska where your gas- your car was freezing while it was running	2280	A
you know the gas- oil or the gas would turn to slush huh-uh see i can't handle that	2280	A
	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
um-hum	2280	A
yeah	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
no something happens then what	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
yeah it's not that bad right now i just hope it don't get any worse	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
that's about it i'm just waiting because see it's tornado season	2280	A
yes it is it's tornado season	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
um-hum you see this is this is tornado weather boy people don't know it but when it gets hot like this	2280	A
and you know like they're predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast	2280	A
there's your tornados that's right and so they're predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty degrees i say huh-uh see that ain't right	2280	A
	2280	A
but that's that's tornado season	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
wait a while it'll change	2280	A
that's right that's about_1 like it is too because yesterday was really nice	2280	A
and the wind was blowing but today is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know	2280	A
i don't know	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
the weather-	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
	2280	A
	2280	A
that's right	2280	A
all righty thank you bye-bye	2280	A
<silence>	2280	A
<silence>	2280	B
okay well uh i guess uh you're pretty aware that it's uh been uh a little warm for this time of year	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
it uh the humidity's a little higher	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
uh-huh you know about a month from now this wouldn't be so bad but uh but boy for the end of March this is uh this is funny	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
 oh jeez	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
	2280	B
well that's a good way to look at it	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
well if if you do that then you'll only be pleasantly surprised probably if it's anything but that	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
that's uh	2280	B
but uh i- i guess uh the winter- the winter wasn't that bad down here really	2280	B
	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
yeah looking- looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
well hopefully you know if it's humid now maybe it'll i remember last year it rained an awful lot or uh you know for the last couple of years it's rained an awful lot and maybe that'll help to defeat some of the heat	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
and if uh if it rains a lot	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
but uh	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
oh yeah you're right yeah yeah i used to live in uh up north up in the uh upper midwest and uh	2280	B
and we had had mosquito- mosquito problems that's for sure	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
oh really	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
well you know it's it's that easy to say but boy when it's uh when it's forty below and you're shoveling snow and it's forty below it's uh	2280	B
it uh that's just the bad thing you either you either have to take the take this kind of weather or uh or take the really really cold weather	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
does it go in any any where north of the Red River	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
that's uh i that's what i've heard people say is they'll never go north of the Red River again	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
um-hum	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
um-hum	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
	2280	B
yeah i- i know what you mean because_1 uh because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the uh plug in uh your car	2280	B
and uh that's not good- that's not good at all and uh	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
well i guess i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesn't stay for very long	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
oh that's right that's right because_1	2280	B
already already hit Oklahoma and probably right down here soon so	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
yeah	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B
um-hum	2280	B

<silence>	2280	B
um-hum	2280	B
<silence>	2280	B

good that's great to hear uh and Christian literature uh i've kind of i used to read a lot of uh novels	2226	A
but it seems as though if you really want to set a time- side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading	2226	A
and i i been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart and he really has it's getting to where a just really want to read it	2226	A

literature	2226	A

a viewing format more or less	2226	A
<silence>	2226	A
uh-huh	2226	A
<silence>	2226	A
do you	2226	A
<silence>	2226	A

<silence>	2226	A
yeah yeah me too	2226	A
well i think we've accomplished five minutes so it's good talking to you bye-bye	2226	A
	2226	A
	2270	A
okay i guess that's it uh	2270	A
i was just thinking about what movies i've seen lately mostly uh we go to uh the second or third run movies i guess what the ones that we call the dollar- used to call the dollar movies	2270	A
uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery and uh	2270	A
found it quite enjoyable myself uh uh had also seen the Hunt For Red October you know with him in that and	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
um-hum	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
	2270	A
well that's	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
well- well i didn't even see Batman so that's uh that's pretty good so	2270	A
or no let's see uh Dick Tracy i did we did see Dick Tracy so that's	2270	A
yeah so	2270	A
uh so you so then you're not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
oh yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah so	2270	A
so you watch a lot of videos	2270	A
then uh	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah that's right what uh what do you find uh that you're looking at most in those uh the i mean are they are they the comedies and uh that kind of stuff	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
um-hum	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
uh-huh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know they're uh they're a dollar and a half- what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now	2270	A
and uh at the Promenade yeah and uh you know we we find those pretty good they're not uh it's not so far you know from when they were first run that you don't enjoy them	2270	A
occasionally you'll find one that's you know some of the friends will be talking about them_1 that you wished that you'd seen them_1 so you could talk about them sooner but uh	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah that's	2270	A
that's a little bit too much so	2270	A
but	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
um-hum	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
uh-huh	2270	A
yeah but uh	2270	A
yeah we we find even uh you know even looking at the dollar movies which are you'd think those are the ones that uh are coming back around because they were good the first time	2270	A
and we don't find a lot of those uh you know they'll be running uh four to six of those on a weekend	2270	A
and you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or three- two out of three or three out of four there won't be anything that we want to go see	2270	A
and uh so then when something comes up they'll usually stay on a while so we we still get a chance to see you know one of them that we want to see	2270	A
but uh we saw Avalon and uh i think we went in to see Avalon because we couldn't get in to maybe we wanted to go see Ghost and couldn't get into Ghost because the line you know they sold out	2270	A
we went to see Avalon and uh i really was not that impressed with Avalon it uh	2270	A
you know it's uh it's one of these uh more i don't know melodramatic and and	2270	A
i don't know uh not satirical wasn't funny at all but it was	2270	A
i don't know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh you know	2270	A
yeah and uh right	2270	A
but uh i really enjoy uh the espionage type of movies the the uh	2270	A
The Hunt For Red October and Russia House i had read uh the Russia House book before so i- i- i thought it was a real good movie um	2270	A
i enjoyed the book quite a bit too so that's that made it made it more interesting to me	2270	A
uh a lot of it the dialogue was uh a little difficult to understand because	2270	A
uh Michelle Pfeiffer had a was speaking with her Russian accent you know the the actress Russian accent so	2270	A
it was part of that was a little hard to understand	2270	A
right and uh	2270	A
so you if you knew what was going on you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i- i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book	2270	A
but uh	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
um yeah	2270	A
yeah we didn't see that one i'm not uh i don't see don't go see too many in well i would but my wife doesn't like the the uh the science fiction semi horror type stuff you know	2270	A
things that uh get you on the edge of your seat a little too much for her	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
um-hum	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
yeah	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
right	2270	A
well it's it's bad enough that you know if you got a little back problem or something have to sit in those seats and wiggle and squirm around and usually come out with your back hurting anyway so	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
right	2270	A
<silence>	2270	A
	2270	A
well anyway uh i guess if uh if you're don't have anything else to talk about i guess i we can hang up on this one	2270	A
okay i appreciate it thanks uh-huh	2270	A
	2270	A
	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
yep	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
yeah	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
yeah yeah sure	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B

God i haven't been in a movie since	2270	B
	2270	B
maybe Superman Batman maybe Batman might have been one yeah	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
it's been	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
i haven't seen any of that stuff really	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
well i love it we uh got a new baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
yeah	2270	B
stop by and get them_1 at you know for ninety nine cents and bring them_1 home but	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
comedies and the PG's and the no skin uh	2270	B
we're uh know like we saw Sally and uh well Billy Crystals in it we saw that one and which was video that's that's probably the last movie i went to see yeah that's probably the last one	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
quarter Promenade yeah	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
sure	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
i mean fifteen bucks to go see a movie with two- with a couple's a little ridiculous	2270	B
yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red	2270	B
okay which is not that old but you know it was bounced around the VCR cabinet there and um	2270	B
 but yeah we i used to really	2270	B
you know i'd just pick up the paper and we'd go see a couple you know three or four movies a month but no we haven't i haven't been to a movie in it's been four or five months	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
really	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
kind of drab	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
ooh my it's got to be something fun yeah you don't have to think yeah sure	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
is it a good movie	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
great	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
let's see	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
probably overcompensated a little bit	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
and well i think the now it's all coming back to me what was the one not The Deep but The Abyss	2270	B
the last year i think	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
um-hum	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
yeah i'm not much of a Robocop man Robocop you know myself	2270	B
this one it wasn't heavy hi-fi you know hi-fi because it was a lot of it was actual stuff that takes place and they had of course the breathing apparatus which was liquid and and then all a sudden	2270	B
you know when you actually met this thing and and that that was you know towards like the last third of the movie only really got strange but it was uh	2270	B
you know it was cold in the theater and it's wet in the movie and they kind of just it was it was comfortable it was easy to go in you didn't have to think a lot and and uh	2270	B
and there is nothing worse than going to see a movie where you have to follow a hidden plot	2270	B
	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
yep	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
specially those intermission movies yep	2270	B
and course those those dollar- dollar and quarter movies you might catch a spring too so	2270	B
	2270	B
	2270	B
they're great	2270	B
<silence>	2270	B
okay	2270	B
thank you sir	2270	B
bye	2270	B
	2270	B
	2251	B
an interesting uh point about sentencing by the judge alone doing away with a jury	2251	B
i don't know if i'd be willing to accept the um abuses that would come along with that and that the it'd be relatively easy to get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of bribery but	2251	B
or even if he just through years of being on the bench just becomes uh out of touch with uh the population and he only sees the bad side of life so much that he just ends up making bad decisions	2251	B
however the complexity of some of these uh cases it's just they spend more time educating the jury up to the point where they can make a decision	2251	B
then it would take if the judge just made the decision especially when it is purely um noncriminal uh litigation type uh whatever you want to call it the term	2251	B
civil uh suits as it were or even some corporate uh law	2251	B
when there's not any individual involved and some of those are solved without a a jury but uh some some do choose to go before it	2251	B
um what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury when they do have a jury must all six or twelve uh agree before the the topic be final or or the verdict be final	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
okay if it the only thing that i was thinking about as far as having if you had one holdout out of say twelve	2251	B
then is it reasonable or is it or could you assume that there must be some reason for that person to be holding out and obviously the other eleven or five cannot convince this person	2251	B
that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little	2251	B
or going to the the	2251	B
very	2251	B
farthest uh safeguard that can be done and uh	2251	B
trying not to get a wrong decision	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
the uh system as it stands now i think if if the juries were done away with the judge could render a decision much quicker	2251	B
uh and you'd you'd feed more people through the courts as it were don't know where we'd put them once we got them through your courts but uh	2251	B
i think the rate of processing is just about uh reached the rate of housing anyway so keep the keep the normal- as it is can't upset the system very much	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
probably yeah i would imagine the judge could throw it out	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
i would imagine that's left up to the judge i i would assume he could consider it a contempt of court and and uh but anything he wanted whatever his limits are on contempt of court	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
certainly makes sense because some of this stuff is you know you- you're just doing this to do this you know it's	2251	B
just doesn't make sense	2251	B
so that's pretty bad a friend of mine is a is a judge here in the -well actually you know it McKinney because we're in Collin County	2251	B
and he is uh just recently changed from hearing all the the DWI type stuff to uh doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go listen to all the divorces so it wasn't much of a step up as it were	2251	B
um it's really tough he says in a lot of cases where he has to make the decision so i guess in a lot of those cases it's it's all up to him as oppose to a jury	2251	B
and there's just no good choice as to where to put the kids sometimes or	2251	B
and of course there couples get kind of spiteful at times and	2251	B
and you hear it all through the worst side of people throughout the whole time	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
well let me think here	2251	B
um	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
as far as the judge making the decision	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
uh-huh	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
yeah that's true	2251	B
but then look at the group that tends to accept jury duty	2251	B
you you either have the person who who is uh the type of individual who can work for a large corporation that can afford to pay them you know let them go	2251	B
and and those are shall we say blue collar that that	2251	B
your work the assembly line type or technician some engineering uh you may not have the the self-employed businessman willing to go because he though he may be	2251	B
current on all you know several social issues and have opinions on things like that he just doesn't want to take his time to go to the jury duty so he probably doesn't vote either so he doesn't get called in some counties	2251	B
so it i don't know whether it would be wiser to have an educated judge even though he may get uh out of touch after a while or whether it would be uh worth it to stick to the class of people that end up there	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
though i have had a judge fact this very judge friend of mine say that he uh does not like to have people on the jury that are from uh the electronics industry	2251	B
and i said well me being from the electronics industry i'll bite why why don't you like it and he said well	2251	B
he said the majority of them uh tend to dive into their little world of of electronics and be very technically minded and be very absorbed with what their field is	2251	B
and they usually don't um read outside their field they don't read social type uh papers they don't they're not up to date on various uh current affairs as it were and	2251	B
and i said well that that's quite possible i said i've discussed some topics with people even over this situation and and discovered some views that i hadn't thought of in a while i just wondered if i got out of my little realm	2251	B
uh if i wouldn't run into people with some more diverse views	2251	B
but uh my realm is pretty well technical and those who you know friends i have are usually we discuss technical items and we don't uh try to follow the world's problems	2251	B
i guess it's too frustrating	2251	B
	2251	B
so	2251	B
well i think we've managed to kill a little time on the topic and we'll go ahead and	2251	B
we'll go ahead and call you another day maybe	2251	B
<silence>	2251	B
okay bye	2251	B
	2251	B
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
um-hum	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
um-hum yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah that that is uh a tough situation i mean because	2251	A
you know i mean some sometimes i feel like maybe some of them are just kind of pressured or not really into you know and	2251	A
and you know- uh people go home and the jury duty is always like you know kind of whining about it all	2251	A
seems like if people were were really you know into the subject and uh	2251	A
i don't know i mean i guess if there if it was more people it would be better if it was just like you know the majority	2251	A
but i guess the smaller number of that was like six or twelve which there usually are so	2251	A
um and i guess unanimous	2251	A
uh	2251	A
yeah i kind of agree with that	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
uh-huh	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah i can see that	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
 yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah i heard about um is is there true that there's a if a lawyer takes a a case to court and it's what do they call it um frivolous is that is there still a frivolous law that they can	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah but do they get um fined the lawyer	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
oh	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah i never i didn't realize until recently that there was actually a fine they could pretty interesting though	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
uh-huh	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
oh really	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
oh really	2251	A
	2251	A
oh	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
oh gosh	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
oh that would be really tough	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah you really do	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah i mean because seems like	2251	A
i don't know i mean there's so many different different types of cases that come in i mean it seems like just general people i mean	2251	A
who are live in the community and do different things you know you have different opinions kind of just one judge who sits there and listens to cases all the time would would get it start thinking a certain way and go go nuts	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah true	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
that is hard to say	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
uh-huh	2251	A
	2251	A
	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
oh i hadn't ever thought of that really	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A

gosh	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
yeah	2251	A
<silence>	2251	A
all right well groovy it's been cool talking to you see you around bye	2251	A
	2261	A
first and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two percent straight across the board cut in federal spending in all departments	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
yes	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
gross national product or profit okay	2261	A
i'm not knowledgeable in that area so i can only agree with what you're saying	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
um-hum	2261	A
seems fair to me also individual level	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
um-hum	2261	A
well i am awfully bored with uh every	2261	A
every tax change uh supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor because	2261	A
i think we have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor so much graft	2261	A
and so much misspending that that money doesn't necessarily go where it's supposed to go	2261	A
uh i know you don't ever cutout greed and corruption but i think the management of the	2261	A
welfare dollar needs to come back to- to the local levels because the local people know exactly who needs that money and who doesn't need that money when it's directed from afar	2261	A
i think the chance for misspending is greater	2261	A
i i suppose i'm thinking more in terms i i'm not thinking in terms of increasing taxes i'm just thinking for a quick fix	2261	A
uh a cut in federal spending is i guess my solution	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
i know that's well maybe that's what i'm saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
right	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
um-hum	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
um-hum	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
i think that's wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income as a retired politician	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
but we do don't we	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
 yes i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you	2261	A
uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous there's they have locked their benefits in to the point that once they've served two terms they're on gravy train anyway	2261	A
yes i think you're right i don't think we should ever give them_1 a lifetime thing	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
it they don't they speak with fork and tongue don't they	2261	A
at least we're in agreement on that aren't we i'm afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and i'm not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
um-hum	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
how do they react then	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
we're prosecuted if we simply don't pay our taxes so i'm not real sure how you believe then that eventually there'll be an overthrow	2261	A
we know communism doesn't work what do we do next	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority saying- speaking on TV saying that the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the	2261	A
that high again and he was speaking in senior citizens living on their incomes of from interest CD interest and that sort of interest i think	2261	A
the voting block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block too but every voting block is	2261	A
slapped and toward their own special interest and i think that makes it doubly difficult to make a change i guess i'm saying we're all selfish	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
yes that's true	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're doing	2261	A
because of the kickbacks and et cetera	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
i'm a bit of a a pessimist i don't see a change in my lifetime i'm afraid	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
you're younger perhaps you can foresee one	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
um-hum	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
um-hum	2261	A
yes i think you're right i'm just saying that i don't think the American people are at this point rebellious enough that it will happen in my lifetime	2261	A
yes i think eventually the system will change i still think we have the best system	2261	A
uh with the elected officials i i'm not sure that uh	2261	A
it's working right now though	2261	A
<silence>	2261	A
absolutely nice talking to you	2261	A
bye	2261	A
	2261	A
	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
now dealing on the federal level	2261	B
two percent- two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder	2261	B
where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because_1 they're actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product	2261	B
or their or their	2261	B
profit rather	2261	B
	2261	B
if they made it straight across the board everybody pay five percent	2261	B
if their gross	2261	B
national profit	2261	B
was	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
say a million dollars then pay five five percent of that	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
but the um	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
overall it just seem like they've modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is it's definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people	2261	B
middle class and	2261	B
you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kickbacks-	2261	B
kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts that's never going to happen	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
the one thing that i	2261	B
had thought about	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
to help correct that problem you've got career politicians that spend thirty forty years in Washington that's all they have ever done	2261	B
after they've been there that long they're so deep rooted with their the old boy network	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman	2261	B
or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then they've got to sit out one	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
i don't think we should ever give them_1 a lifetime income	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
unfortunately	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
and they're the ones that have screamed so much- much- much about	2261	B
that don't want to increase taxes and they don't want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
i think- eventually it's going get to the point where	2261	B
there's going to be a majority of the American people that have had enough of what it's	2261	B
finally come to we're	2261	B
you getting so far down to where	2261	B
you're being taxed so far down where you can't even afford to change your mind	2261	B
it's going to come to a point where the average American citizens say we've had enough	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
well in the form of capitalism that we've got apparently that's not working real good either	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
maybe not a case of everybody being selfish	2261	B
every man carry their own fair burden but not somebody else's	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
i never put anything beyond	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
as far as when it'll happen	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
that i'm not real sure of if it will happen i have no doubt	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
it is the best system that's out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point	2261	B
<silence>	2261	B
okay nice talking to you bye	2261	B
	2261	B
<silence>	2206	A
have you been having any uh good weather lately	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
oh i'm in Texas Plano uh-huh	2206	A
yes i do	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah it was pretty nice today but i stayed inside i came up with a cold couple days ago so i'm taking care of that but uh yeah it's nice and sunny out	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
uh not lately but uh yeah there was a little bit of rain couple days ago and they had tornados up in uh Oklahoma and i guess in Wichita Falls too	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
uh-huh	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
no i'm from Wisconsin originally uh i don't know what the weather's been like up there but uh typically in March it's still uh kind uh kind of like winter uh very cold	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
well- we had a real mild winter here though	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
 okay i can believe that uh-huh	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
no i've well Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as New York uh i'm sure	2206	A
i think it depends on what part of the state	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
but this winter here i think we only had one instance of ice one weekend	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh three real cold spells i don't have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didn't manage to survive	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh it's not very humid and there's always a nice uh breeze blowing	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
you know i've been here about thirteen years and i've gotten quite- quite acclimated to the weather i the summers don't bother me anymore at all i don't mind when it gets over a hundred degrees	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
	2206	A
yeah	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
sure	2206	A
i don't know what kind of a summer we're expecting this year i imagine it's going to be hot again	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
well that's pretty typical though uh i don't uh	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
i don't guess it's going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August we'll see our or uh share of hundred degree days	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
no i never have	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
i've been close uh was in Detroit one time just right right across the river from Windsor	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah i believe that	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
i was in Wisconsin over uh the Christmas holidays and it was about uh twenty below zero when i got up there	2206	A
they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during the week that i was there	2206	A
so it's stayed cold for the entire week	2206	A
um we got one day of snow and one day of ice other than that it was pretty good just cold	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
we don't get too much snow here	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
well i can live without ice	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah the snow is nice doesn't usually last too long here	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah i remember maybe uh maybe three winters where we had a white Christmas here	2206	A
other than that it's uh the snow usually doesn't last more than a day or two	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
we	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
uh-huh yeah well that's not uncommon	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
what's really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads and the temperature doesn't get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah	2206	A
that is if if the businesses are all open uh lot of them close down	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
that's right we didn't close at all this past winter	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
well we usually have to make them_1 up though so	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
uh well i work at the main set in Dallas yeah uh-huh	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
i well did uh did you get much rain two days ago	2206	A
much rain	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah Thursday	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
i didn't get much rain here in Plano but i guess it really poured in Richardson	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah i don't think we got uh i don't think we got it near as bad as uh Oklahoma and i guess Fort Worth had high high winds in fact uh the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the Water Gardens that killed two people	2206	A
so they usually get uh worse weather than we do	2206	A
in winter too	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
and- we get a lot of tornados too this is the time of the year	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
no i sure haven't	2206	A
it's i think it's supposed to be nice though	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
seventies eighties i guess	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
i've been checking on my plants seeing the- the roses bud out already	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah somewhat uh have to kind of watch watch the weather make sure everything is going the way it's supposed to	2206	A
waiting for the waiting- waiting for the weather to get nice out so i can go ahead and uh replace some of the some of the dead shrubs from winter	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
but uh like i said i stayed in today because_1 i picked up a cold the other day so didn't feel like going outside and doing much	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
uh-huh	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah we we really haven't- didn't get enough rain the other day to uh do much good for uh things growing just a lot of weeds right now and they'll come up whether we get nice weather or not	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
uh-huh	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
well you've got a lot more control over the inside temperature than you do- than you do outside	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
okay	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
yeah i don't do well with potted plants outside i tend to neglect- neglect them and they sit in the sun too long and dry up or uh if i don't put them_1 in the sun they don't grow	2206	A
i don't know but uh yeah i guess next week's supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and we're ready to- to go outside and do some outdoor activities	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
okay	2206	A
well	2206	A
uh	2206	A
i haven't heard the forecast for the next- for uh coming up for this weekend or next week so i'm not sure what to expect	2206	A
i can only guess that it's supposed to be nice	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
uh-huh	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
i'm not sure what the overnight low was	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
 oh yeah	2206	A
guess i'll have to turn on the weather on the news tonight see what we're supposed to expect	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
anyway i guess everything's been pretty typical for March	2206	A
have to see what uh April or May have to offer	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
sometimes it does uh sometimes it'll get in the eighties uh as early as uh January February	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
well they still have snow on the ground through March and probably part of April sometimes	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
well it leaves a mess then when it does melt everything thaws out	2206	A
<silence>	2206	A
lot of mud-	2206	A
<silence>	2206	B
well today was really nice the past few days have been rather chilly uh we had a lot of rain recently i'm in Texas where are you	2206	B
oh you are do you work for TI oh i see	2206	B
yeah so then we've been having just about the same weather	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
have you been doing anything outside in this great weather	2206	B
no	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah i know we had a tornado watch- watch a couple of days ago but nothing really happened	2206	B
are you originally from uh Texas	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
the	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
um-hum	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
well i lived in New York for a long time so Texas is Texas weather is quite uh different for me	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
right	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
 right	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah the only thing i don't like about uh Dallas weather is that it gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
yeah like New York was really humid you know you	2206	B
but you could you could walk around outside in New York you could just stay outside in in it you know because_1 it was	2206	B
i guess the average summer temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties	2206	B
and it was	2206	B
pretty pleasant except for the humidity	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
well at least you can plan you can say well uh i'm going to go to the beach next Wednesday and you'll know that it's going to be hot enough to go	2206	B
but in- in New York you really never know you can plan to- you know to go up to the beach on the Fourth of July and then you know it might be seventy degrees or something	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
yeah- i'm sure it will in Dallas Texas	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
right	2206	B
have you ever been to Canada	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
um	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
uh that's supposed to be really cold weather in the winter that's why New York gets so cold because_1 it's so close to Canada	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
goodness	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
was it snowing- snowing	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
um	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
you know uh Christmas really doesn't seem like Christmas to me unless i do see the snow and the ice	2206	B
it uh it's just really pretty with the snow and the ice and all of the lights not necessarily not the ice i should keep- leave the ice out of it but the snow is real pretty	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B
i remember- i know one Christmas when i was in Dallas it snowed- it snowed and and there was a white Christmas but i don't	2206	B
i guess it's been about five or six years ago	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
um-hum	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
i just think it's really really pretty	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
i remember one Christmas here it was sixty degrees that was so strange to me having lived in New York you know	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
yeah and people drive like the street- street is dry	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
i don't think TI's closed down in a couple of years for bad weather	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
oh	2206	B
i look forward to one of those days	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
not	2206	B
now that's true did- you say you work in Plano	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B

<silence>	2206	B

<silence>	2206	B
yeah well i live in an apartment so the only thing i grow are plants inside and i don't do very- very well with those i think the temperature in here	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah but i guess i just don't know what i'm doing	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
sometimes i- i'd sit the plants outside on the patio and- and i'd forget about them_1 and it gets too hot out there and- and they you know	2206	B
burn up and so forth that's happened to quite a few of my plants	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
um-hum	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B

<silence>	2206	B
well good i hope hope it's nice too	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
i hope it's as nice as it was today	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
seems like it was extra cold last night though	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
but i know it was cold i had to turn on the heat and- get quilts yeah	2206	B
yeah	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
uh-huh	2206	B

yeah but it up in New York it's cold till about June	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
um	2206	B
yeah one thing about the snow in March it- at- at least it'll melt it melts quickly up there	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
that's true	2206	B
<silence>	2206	B
	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
um i try to ride the stationary bicycle everyday about five miles	2296	A
and i love to walk so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk what about you	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
uh very good	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
um-hum	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
uh-huh	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
yeah there are there are lots of bike paths i know my son is a biker and he he's done the whole C and O canal i think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts	2296	A
and so uh but that- that somehow takes organization for me it's much easier just the stationary bike you know it's at home i can i can do some of my reading	2296	A
um	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
but	2296	A
no i live in Maryland	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
right right and that's it um at work we have a a nice campus so i'm able to um	2296	A
take advantage of of the environment here um	2296	A
the neighborhood also i mean we're within walking distance of of stores and shops so i do	2296	A
now i think um basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
um-hum right i think	2296	A
pretty much you've summed up my my my motivations also	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
oh well that's great that's great	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
um-hum	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
right and actually in in summer i like to swim we don't have facilities for swimming in winter but um	2296	A
and and that's true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool	2296	A
i'm much much more awake i'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening	2296	A
so	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
no i'm not	2296	A
no	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
oh really	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
 no i don't know that but i i must say that um	2296	A
when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent	2296	A
and it's probably because i i was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California and at- and at that point that was sort of a limit but but since then i've been abroad a lot so	2296	A
 it's a mixture	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
in Santa Barbara	2296	A
<silence>	2296	A
oh i see	2296	A
um-hum	2296	A
well very good and- i think we've probably know know each other's exercise habits and um it was nice talking to you	2296	A
oh okay bye bye	2296	A
	2296	A
	2296	B
well do you exercise regularly Judy	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
um-hum	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
 well um i uh exercise regularly i work at a university and i swim almost everyday	2296	B
upwards of a mile but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit uh my daughter lives in Arlington and when i go to visit her i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike	2296	B
oh gosh you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern Virginia	2296	B
or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i don't do that regularly but Washington's a great place to do that	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
 um-hum	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
right	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
do you live in the District	2296	B
uh-huh	2296	B
	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
um-hum	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
well it's uh it's really both i'm certainly driven by	2296	B
the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh	2296	B
and most of the time i enjoy it sometimes i don't but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't wanna is also worth something	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising like i'll be really tired and i'll start swimming and i'll actually- and i'll actually get energy	2296	B
and i'll be have much more energy when i'm done than when i started i mean i just feel great that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
that's really a terrific feeling because_1 you just go there at the end of the day and you figure God i'm ready for bed	2296	B
and you exercise and then it's sort of it's painful for a while but by the time you get done you're feeling really terrific	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
yeah yeah	2296	B
so are can i just ask you are you Canadian	2296	B
Philadelphia	2296	B
i'm trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that's probably gonna drive the TI people crazy you say out instead of out you say out	2296	B
did you know that	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
hm	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
hm	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B

i know this isn't on our topic but where did you grow up in California	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
oh okay because_1 i grew up in North Hollywood California i went to UCLA and all that	2296	B
<silence>	2296	B
yes	2296	B
well same here thanks for calling bye	2296	B
	2296	B
<silence>	2273	A
hi Phil	2273	A
pretty good how many children did you say you had	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
wow you have three children boys girls	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
i have uh three as well uh mine are uh uh twenty five twenty four and twenty one the numbers keep changing so it's hard for me to remember	2273	A
	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
wow	2273	A
so you don't get a chance to to spend much time with him then until when he comes home	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
wow i uh unfortunately didn't spend enough- enough time with my children uh	2273	A
where i- i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger uh i was attending school	2273	A
and then i found myself short of cash so i uh also went in for a part-time job so by the time that i got home after my second job	2273	A
 children either in bed or just getting ready to go to bed and the only time that i got to see them was on weekends and on weekends i had to do my homework so it uh it	2273	A
you know it took away a lot of of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that	2273	A
that i- i didn't really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
it's it's unbelievable how fast you know you- when when you get to the point where even your kid's age they don't want to spend time with you anymore and you know i	2273	A
i can i can remember when my children used to beg me to go with you know even to take them to the store or take them someplace and and it just gradually goes away until you have to ask them do you want to come with me and then they start saying no so	2273	A
 well it- it's not sudden it's just that it probably doesn't hit the average person uh until it hits them over the head	2273	A
uh because you because even even my oldest uh child when he comes uh comes to the house he's still he's still my my my child and and i don't think of him as an adult yet and uh that that's one of his complaints	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
uh-huh	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
so you had a bunch- a bunch of kids in the car that must have that must have that must have been fun	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
well camping is one thing that i- i could never get used to uh i- i used to take the kids to go fishing and things like that but i never went uh never went camping	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
yeah	2273	A
yeah up in uh New England it's uh	2273	A
uh you know three or four or five months tops after that you're in the house	2273	A
 because it becomes so cold out here that uh and sometimes the weather gets to you so you don't want to go outside and drive around	2273	A
	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
well i can think of of some enjoyable things that that i did with the kids like we used to go up to uh New Hampshire quite a bit and go to the uh uh the White Mountains area and and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that	2273	A
but i wouldn't sleep on the ground i went into a hotel but i used to take the kids to uh you know the things like uh the places where there are animals and you go in and and feed the animals and things like that and uh	2273	A
yeah hey you know and the and the kids used to enjoy that as well and i like children in fact uh one of the things that i notice a dramatic change was that that uh like if i'd be in a supermarket and i'd see a cute little kid i wouldn't think twice about patting the kid on the head	2273	A
well as time grew by and i think i had my daughter with me one time and she went strolling away and i saw this kid and i patted her on the head and the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away you know pulled the kid and i	2273	A
and i turned around and i realized my daughter wasn't there anymore so all she saw was a an adult standing there patting her kid on the head so i- i i didn't realize it until after uh you know after it all happened what what the uh the-	2273	A
the sort of person uh it was uh really something	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
uh-huh	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
you attend a lot of their games	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
uh-huh	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
uh-huh	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
yeah i- i uh i felt that myself- myself as i as i grew older my child grew older that i realized that i didn't spend half as much time with my daughter as i did my sons because uh i'd want to do the things that i thought	2273	A
that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like uh you know fishing and and doing outside- things outside and my daughter didn't like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than uh	2273	A
than with myself and i think uh she's closer to her mother today than than she is to me because of that	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
yeah it's unfortunate because yeah you know even- even though you you think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them without even realizing it	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
yeah well she was close but yet whenever i wanted to do something it was always something something different than what she wanted to do	2273	A
um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh she'd always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh uh playing someplace but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out for the kids	2273	A
and uh she'd always say well i want to go to my girlfriend's house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
so i- i kind of missed that um i my daughter especially uh being with her	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
no she's the the second oldest she's uh twenty twenty three now	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
personality traits and things like that uh no i can't say that i have	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
uh-huh	2273	A
yeah i think you force it on them and and the youngest one tends to be the one that's spoiled	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
the youngest one is more sensitive that's same with my family and it's it's strange	2273	A
 well it just so happens that my youngest is uh extremely sensitive uh where my oldest one uh you know i can scream at him and yell at him and he'll look at me with with	2273	A
 but if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he he will he won't cry anymore because he's too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and and i can feel that	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
yeah	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
i remember when i first took my kids out uh fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but uh no i was with my oldest son uh my youngest son wasn't old enough or i didn't think he was old enough to take out and uh	2273	A
uh we caught this fish it was uh it was a fairly large size fish and he was very very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and we we came home and he uh	2273	A
he wanted to show his mom what he caught because it was his first fish and he wanted to put it in the bathtub so she told him no he couldn't do it but he did it anyway fill the water filled the bathtub full of water and uh	2273	A
uh put the fish in it now after the fish died from being handled so much uh we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool so after he realized the fish wasn't going to come back uh to life again we went out there and they buried it	2273	A
and uh	2273	A
you know we did it together and i- i come in the house and i wash my hands and i turn around and i did something and i saw the kids out there with sticks digging it up again and i went out there said what are you doing he said i wanted to show my friend the fish that i caught	2273	A
 so he's so he's out there digging it up	2273	A
<silence>	2273	A
yeah well it was his first fish he didn't he didn't want to hide it he wanted everybody	2273	A
<silence>	2273	B
how you doing	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
i have three i didn't say i- i have three of them yeah two uh i have the girl is the oldest and then two boys	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah well you're doing a lot better than i can i can't rattle them off like that i know my youngest is eighteen he's uh as i said in a senior in high school but i have a	2273	B
uh my oldest son he's uh out seeing the world right now he's in Australia at the present time	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
well he's yeah he's been gone for about_1 seven months now we're expecting him to be getting home here before too much longer hopefully	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
ouch	2273	B
yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
um	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
 yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
right	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
i'll bet that story's all too common i uh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah they sure develop their own interests	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
 it can be pretty sudden too	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah maybe so uh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
i don't think i uh i would have to say i probably didn't get to spend as much time as i would have liked to either uh however i did you know uh	2273	B
early on i was in the retail business and i worked late hours so i saw less of them_1 then but then when i changed over and got into electronics industry i uh	2273	B
i did have more time and i tried to spend some more time with them_1	2273	B
and uh you know we did things as a family we went camping quite a bit and we uh you know took trips went to see my folks in Florida and	2273	B
and some of those kind of things	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah we did we did quite a bit of that just traveling and we had several Volkswagen buses there for a period of time in our later years then we did when we were camping and stuff and that made it a little easier or a station wagon	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
uh-huh	2273	B
that may be the difference in our part of the country we live in it's a lot easier to get out outside all year round uh well pretty near all year round out here	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
i guess uh	2273	B
i can think of a uh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
uh things i would like to have done differently on uh on the kids though	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
um-hum	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
 yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
uh-huh	2273	B
oh yeah	2273	B
petting zoos and things	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
um-hum	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
 oh yeah oh oh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
our kids played uh	2273	B
ball it wasn't it was like you know Little League and uh it was Dads Oaks Dads Club which was a like a Little League	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah we used to go to the games and we had uh	2273	B
i never did actually coach i'd go do some of the sideline stuff and like that but i never did actually coach but they tried to get me to do that i but we'd go you know and watch them practice and	2273	B
and uh pick them_1 up and carry them_1 there and that kind of thing	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
uh i personally don't believe i did no for one reason being like i mentioned i was in retail when she was younger	2273	B
and then	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
you know she being a girl i guess she probably uh spent a lot of time with her mother more so than with me	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
um-hum	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
oh yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
uh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah	2273	B
that's probably the same	2273	B
case in our family too	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah a lot of cases daughters getting get real close to their dads too you know and uh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
is your daughter the uh oldest	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
oh middle child	2273	B
you uh you have you ever heard much about that theory about the uh you know how their different their their position in the family relates to their uh character- you know some of their	2273	B
mannerisms and personality yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah i believe it's true it's my experiences uh what i know about it and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other people's children too it's uh	2273	B
you know it's uh you know the older kid is uh is more always more prone to be more like responsible and that kind of thing	2273	B
 yeah it is a natural development i think it	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah and uh	2273	B
in our case he he's real sensitive and real uh thoughtful and uh	2273	B
yes	2273	B
i don't know if	2273	B
yeah i don't know if that relates to that or not but	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
 my oldest yeah my oldest daughter is hard headed as can be	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah right that's	2273	B
that's Matthew he's it's boy uh he was always he just	2273	B
he'd keep it to himself a lot of times but he'd really kind of well up and-	2273	B
be ready to cry or whatever	2273	B
he's gotten now to where he can take it better he'll dish it back a little bit but	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
	2273	B
huh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
uh	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
yeah that was i'm sure it was a powerful experience for him it's something he'll remember	2273	B
<silence>	2273	B
	2254	A
so what type of restaurant do you like	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um-hum yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
uh-huh yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
yeah now do Indian- are Indian foods kosher	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
right	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
 i i was about to say i didn't think so but most of the most of the the vegetarian Indian meals	2254	A
uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um-hum	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
oh definitely Chinese would uh-huh	2254	A
um-hum yeah because pastas and the and the different types of sauces and things sure yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
which is of what no we don't have one uh-huh	2254	A
you know my wife and you would probably love to go eat together yeah oh definitely well everytime- when we go someplace they have to have good French fries	2254	A
if they don't have good French fries you know if it's one of if it's a place that has other things if it's not that then we go to Chinese food you know i order	2254	A
you know a beef and broccoli or chicken- or chicken and broccoli or something like that you know chicken and cashews and she orders um bean curd	2254	A
and and vegetables right you know so um you two would probably eat real well together	2254	A
uh-huh yeah she she normally picks all of our restaurants though yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
well we really can't- we really don't do that that often um i i guess recently we did um	2254	A
i get when we got engaged last summer um we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating and we went to the Annapolis area which is um	2254	A
Annapolis Maryland it it's uh state capital but it's also on the water so there's a lot of restaurants there it's uh it's a um	2254	A
very trendy resort type town but the my wife lived in Annapolis for a short time and uh she really liked this one restaurant it was it's French	2254	A
but it was really good everything that was very garlicky and their big specials are things like um very fancy omelets or very fancy crepes	2254	A
and then they also have a lot of other uh French oriented uh meals and i normally get something that's crepe and very American and then she gets something French yeah but um yeah but	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
yeah definitely definitely yeah but most of the time when we go out um	2254	A
we either go Mexican because uh uh she just has a a need for either some type of Mexican chips or Mexican pizza or something like that or French fries	2254	A
you have to you have to have French fries with just about every meal unless you're eating something other you know some other uh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
right yeah in fact um since Baltimore- i see i'm not a you don't know the Baltimore- Baltimore's on the water and what-	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um yes yeah we just had salmon last night for dinner uh but also the spices here um old bay is a spice i don't know if you're even aware of it it's what they used on the	2254	A
uh if you ever hear of the Maryland steamed crabs	2254	A
okay well old bay is the spice they put on	2254	A
the steamed crabs well true male Marylander- Marylander- Marylander's have have old bay on just about everything they put it on their French fries they'll put it in their potato salad they'll um	2254	A

and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars	2254	A
and that's you know that's the two of us having unlimited- unlimited French fries	2254	A
and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having French fries	2254	A
then i- i'll order like a vegetable soup or something you know but she'll just have the French fries you know	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
no no in fact in- we're very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fast-food restaurants uh just because of the um the styrofoam and the plastic waste	2254	A
and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fast-food restaurant i will i'll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more	2254	A
but um yeah but she will- she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we're at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store	2254	A
we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the store and bring it home yeah and we take yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um-hum	2254	A
yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
well that's a really good idea	2254	A
yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um-hum yeah we we've used the same uh you know tin bottom with plastic top	2254	A
probably for the past oh i don't know six months	2254	A
yeah so so we're very you know we try to be very environmental and and in fact it's terrible now because um i guess we've donated money to a number of organizations and you know we're in school i'm in school and we're	2254	A
barely surviving here and and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation like demanding a hundred dollars	2254	A
yeah and when you say but we're in college- uh we're in graduate school we can't afford that you know they they say well how about twenty seven well how about ten you know yeah so	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
uh-huh yeah we do all we can now	2254	A
but that it it you know i think that also goes along uh the reason why we pick the restaurants that we go to you know we we really -have we really look at restaurants now there's one other little restaurant in town that we'll go to that is um	2254	A
sandwiches and chips and a pickle you know but you still and that's five fifty	2254	A
but if you go to a fast-food restaurant you're going to spend four fifty and you're going to produce a lot of styrofoam and a lot of plastic so we you know we'll go there instead of you know just going to a fast-food place	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
yeah	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
i do too	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um-hum	2254	A
	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
no uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
oh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
oh	2254	A
jeez i'll tell Laura- i'll tell Laura about that	2254	A
uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um-hum	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
um-hum	2254	A
yeah that's because my- that's really see because a lot of times we'll order a pizza we'll just get a regular cheese pizza or um uh for we just recently got married so my wife	2254	A
got a uh a heavy duty mixer like a KitchenAid or something like that it's called so she's make she makes dough pizza dough and freezes it	2254	A
and then takes it out before i get home for the weekend because pizza's probably one of my favorite- most favorite food yeah and she'll make that for the weekend and she'll make you know we'll have two pizzas mine will be regular tomatoes and um	2254	A
mozzarella and Monterey jack cheese you know sprinkled on it and her's will be you know something	2254	A
uh more gourmet but more you know with yeah more with what you like and i- i she loves broccoli and spinach and i think uh she i don't think she's ever probably thought of that	2254	A
uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
yeah so it's it's just regular it's just tomatoes uh-huh	2254	A
<silence>	2254	A
	2254	B
basically well i'm a vegetarian um and my husband is kosher so if do you know what that means kosher okay so a a lot of the restaurants we select are um	2254	B
based on the variety of food i don't particularly like to sort of American you know meat and potatoes type of restaurants	2254	B
um i i love ethnic foods i love um Chinese Indian Tai	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
well as long as you're not eating meat um it's to be kosher the meat would have to be kosher	2254	B
	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
yeah exactly vegetables and and the same with you know a lot of people wonder do you- you know do you find restaurants that will just have vegetarian meals and and even	2254	B
if like you know you could go to a Chinese restaurant and eat the right um Italian you know that	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
right	2254	B
yeah and even um one of my favorites is El Torito's i don't know if you have that it's Mexican it's like a Chi-Chi's	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
really why	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh yeah	2254	B
	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh really	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
uh-huh	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh tofu	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B

oh does she now do you guys like to go out for sort of fine dining or are you more uh	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
uh-huh um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
right	2254	B
	2254	B
oh	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
uh-huh	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
crepes yeah	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
yeah so she's the daring one in the family as far as food goes	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
 unless you're eating like a baked potato or something	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
yeah i was i was wondering if you guys eat a lot of fish um yeah	2254	B
uh-huh	2254	B
	2254	B
no	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
sure yeah i have heard of that	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh really	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
i see it's sort of like some people and ketchup yeah	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
uh-huh	2254	B
oh really	2254	B
oh wow well you know i have a problem because i tend to find a restaurant and being on a on a tighter budget you know we don't go out to eat that much so once i find a restaurant i only want to go there	2254	B
and i'll go there for you know two months straight we won't go anyplace else	2254	B
and then you know i finally get sick of that one and then i'll find another restaurant i love salad bar restaurants because um	2254	B
i find that when you order a salad at a restaurant you don't really get a salad you get like lettuce and you know what i mean and the croutons	2254	B
exactly but a salad bar that's that's my favorite i mean if because i just feel like i can make my own meal and there's usually a lot of fun stuff and obviously it's a lot of vegetables but um	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum yeah i know what that's like uh-huh	2254	B
	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh that's good	2254	B
that's very good	2254	B
	2254	B
uh-huh um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh really	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
now is she does she like um McDonald's French fries oh okay	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
yep	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
well that's great	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
it just more yeah i know what you mean	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
yeah	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh do you	2254	B
but still uh-huh	2254	B
well you know it's funny that you say that because um our grocery store uh i personally i think the grocery stores in Rochester are very they'll allow you to bring your own like um Tupperware thing like your own container	2254	B
to fill it up i think that's great and you weigh your container you know and then you weigh your salad after that	2254	B
 it really is i was very happy about that because i you know i feel the same way you do	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
 oh that's great that really is good-	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
yeah	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh jeez	2254	B
oh man	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
great how to say no and your like you'll do your own part you know you can do without necessarily spending much um-hum yeah	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
yep yep	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
uh-huh	2254	B
	2254	B
 yep	2254	B
a lot more waste yeah	2254	B
um-hum that true	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
uh-huh well i i don't usually resort to fast food um if i do i feel like it's a salad or something at McDonald's but i do rely on pizza a lot	2254	B
um i mean to me either ordering in or just going to Pizza Hut or something	2254	B
	2254	B
okay well they just they'll do everything with pizzas as a matter of fact last night we just went there and they have a great pizza called {Spinoccoli} and what it is is um normal pizza but then with spinach and broccoli	2254	B
and it's really really good and i feel like	2254	B
yeah tell her about that um and i feel like i'm getting a little bit more health out of that pizza then maybe just well i wouldn't eat pepperoni but you know sausage or something like that but um	2254	B
so i	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
uh-huh	2254	B
	2254	B
uh-huh	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
oh yeah	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
really	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
cashews or something like that right	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
um-hum	2254	B
<silence>	2254	B
well {Spinoccoli} she can't patent the idea though because Pizza Inn already- already has it but it's a it's very good well they put it they i guess they put like the dough and then the sauce and then	2254	B
	2374	A
well who's the team	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
oh really well i i'm picking Duke because_1 uh they just won it	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
it's just yeah it's just over just uh about five- ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think	2374	A
either five or eight it was a good game	2374	A
but uh Duke was just too much for them_1 Kansas just couldn't couldn't hang with them	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because_1 i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh	2374	A
Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them_1	2374	A
it was a good game	2374	A
but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
that's right that's right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys	2374	A
but they they they fell i tell you	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because_1 i think if they would play their game i don't know if there's anybody that could that could keep up with them	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
but	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
uh i i was since the	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah that's right	2374	A
yeah here in Dallas i'll tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems	2374	A
i tell you	2374	A
oh really	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they	2374	A
uh they can't hardly trade him because_1 nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind	2374	A
but uh they they i think they've just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year	2374	A
they've uh they've got Derek Harper that's a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman	2374	A
and uh really they're about it they've got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn't have the offensive skills	2374	A
and then they've got James Donaldson who's been there forever playing center and uh	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
just all right but he's getting to where uh i don't know if it's his age or what but he just can't play the whole game they've got to get somebody young that can uh run the court that's still big	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
oh uh	2374	A
not McCrae but uh	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
let's see are you uh Perkins	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they they've got a	2374	A
yeah	2374	A
and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae	2374	A
yeah they didn't and i'm not for sure what the deal is on him i think he's been hurt but he hadn't played	2374	A
he hadn't played in probably two months	2374	A
and i've i've gone to about three or four of their games and i don't even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to	2374	A
so uh	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
it uh you know i i bet it was	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
that's right that's right from uh uh Detroit that's right that's who that was yeah because_1 i don't think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh	2374	A
yeah free agent his contract ended and they didn't sign him	2374	A
and uh	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think	2374	A
Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were	2374	A
and shoot you can't blame him man that's that's a phenomenal amount of money	2374	A
but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
uh no i don't think so they they were right before the uh uh	2374	A
oh what do you call it- all-star break but ever since the all-star break uh	2374	A
shoot they've they've played terrible	2374	A
and uh so now it'd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick	2374	A
because_1 uh	2374	A
there's no way they can even- i think mathematically they're out of the play-off scene now	2374	A
so you know they they need to just play for a play-off pick	2374	A
or a	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
you know the Suns are are pretty good	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
they're uh	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah and they did- they made some trades uh	2374	A
oh they had one white guy i can't think of his name that was real good	2374	A
white uh Chambers yeah and uh	2374	A
you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they'd be uh awesome because_1 that guy can play	2374	A
that Chambers is is something else	2374	A
but uh	2374	A
i don't know it'll it'll be interesting	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
i i really don't follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know it's just hard to keep up with them	2374	A
but college- i really enjoy college basketball	2374	A
	2374	A
the most	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
no they sure didn't sure didn't	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
oh okay so you keep up with the	2374	A
uh	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah	2374	A
more of a football powerhouse i guess	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
more of a football powerhouse up there i guess	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
is basketball pretty big	2374	A
do what	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
i	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
that's- that's true that is right	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah so that's a tough conference	2374	A
huh	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
yeah because_1 Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse	2374	A
but uh	2374	A
and Michigan too but uh well i tell you what i appreciate uh the conversation	2374	A
and uh we'll have to we'll have to see how Phoenix ends up	2374	A
<silence>	2374	A
 you too bye-bye	2374	A
	2374	A

<silence>	2374	B
well you and everybody else	2374	B
<silence>	2374	B
well a lot of pressure on them_1 though i think uh	2374	B
i don't think they had the same type of enthusiasm- -enthusiasm or attitude	2374	B
<silence>	2374	B
probably too conservative or too	2374	B
<silence>	2374	B
uh	2374	B
<silence>	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
<silence>	2374	B

Dantely didn't they get Dantely	2374	B
<silence>	2374	B
i think that was involved with the Perkins- Perkins trade to tell you the truth	2374	B
oh oh no no no no no no it was what is his name McGuire that was	2374	B
McGuire yeah	2374	B
<silence>	2374	B

	2374	B
<silence>	2309	B
never i've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
you haven't huh if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial	2309	B
and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what but uh	2309	B
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion	2309	B
hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides	2309	B
TV shows	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the affixing- affixing- affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature	2309	B
 i don't know if that is best left up to the jury to decide- to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh	2309	B
the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
um-hum	2309	B
that's true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death	2309	B
you know the death penalty and such	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
uh-huh	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
right	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail	2309	B
although you still hear about those occasionally	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial	2309	B
and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury	2309	B
and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent	2309	B
and they took it more as just like a majority	2309	B
so i- i	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
but uh	2309	B
rather interesting	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
uh-huh i did i did also	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
	2309	B
uh-huh	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
what about in international	2309	B
trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts	2309	B
like you know the old day with the rack we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them_1	2309	B
nobody	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
so	2309	B
but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know people from different countries	2309	B
uh in as international law also	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
um-hum	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
right	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
i don't know how what it what it would take to be come up with a true perfect	2309	B
system or if one exists but	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
uh is that the crime and it's already false due to some chart and determine the punishment or	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
um-hum i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh	2309	B
i guess there should be some flexibility because_1 every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature	2309	B
i	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
yeah that serves a kind of if they're i guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that	2309	B
and i guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you're in for life	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
yeah although i guess it's your you want them_1 to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
no because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
yes it's another war zone	2309	B
but	2309	B
who knows	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
i agree get them_1 out there	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
sure they should have them_1 go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them_1 they should get some kind of kind of work out of them	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
exactly	2309	B
trading their lives for cigarettes	2309	B
those kinds of things	2309	B
well good	2309	B
<silence>	2309	B
i think so	2309	B
nice talking to you also	2309	B
have a wonderful Easter	2309	B
bye	2309	B
	2309	B
	2309	A
okay have you ever served as a juror	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
uh-huh	2309	A
i never have either	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
true	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah i think that's true	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
	2309	A
yeah do you would you prefer all trials by a judge	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
uh-huh	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
if they give them_1 all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them_1 if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff	2309	A
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them_1 leave and	2309	A
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
right	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
uh-huh	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
uh-huh	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
oh	2309	A
some of them_1 disagree i mean some of them_1 said one way and some the other	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
i think it does have to be unanimous	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but	2309	A
i thought that they all had to agree or else they it was a hung jury	2309	A
and	2309	A
yeah i think- i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe uh	2309	A
majority might be sufficient	2309	A
it's hard to say though i	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
oh	2309	A
yeah i hadn't thought about international trials at all	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
right	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street	2309	A
for something like that because of the cultural differences	2309	A
things like that	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah what about uniform sentencing	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
right yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years it's not a discretionary thing	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years	2309	A
you know	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah i	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them_1 do something that's not pleasant	2309	A
and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them_1 and	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah something besides license plates and tiddlywinks	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
yeah	2309	A
<silence>	2309	A
well i think that covers it	2309	A
it was nice talking to you	2309	A
um bye	2309	A
you too bye	2309	A
	2309	A
<silence>	2316	A
it's it's hard topic- topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yes well yeah i am	2316	A
um actually- actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling	2316	A
but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in New York City or Washington DC	2316	A
uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
well that's really too bad because it- it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
oh they they have that down there that	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school	2316	A
so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there	2316	A
to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them_1 there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that	2316	A
that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about	2316	A
trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day	2316	A
so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yes are they going to move to uh Mexico	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them you know if the industry comes	2316	A
hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large IBM plant has something to do with the top rated high school	2316	A
because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school	2316	A
because your parents are engineers or chemists they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah you hope well i think i- i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that	2316	A
i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in	2316	A
i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him so i don't know it's just like	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and to- to see what they need and not overinflate it	2316	A
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here	2316	A
we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though	2316	A
we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
so	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah but i always see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It it's it's all money based	2316	A
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school	2316	A
who knows but- maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead they seem to have done a the good job in the past	2316	A
in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
yeah the i don't	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
	2316	A
or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
is it	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
well that	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
well	2316	A
<silence>	2316	A
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's University of Vermont um	2316	A
we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you	2316	A
<silence>	2316	B
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or	2316	B
	2316	B
state school	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
okay but you're excluding high-level education	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
okay	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and	2316	B
having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
right	2316	B
well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done	2316	B
because we were so far advanced and uh the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools	2316	B
so you know i- i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier	2316	B
and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools	2316	B
but uh you know	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
right	2316	B
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them_1	2316	B
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
right in high school	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
right	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
and	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
right	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them_1 just want to go play	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
so oh i don't know	2316	B
about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here	2316	B
i say we because_1 i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
yeah	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
right	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
you hope	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the government- the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it	2316	B
you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
yeah	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
yeah	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
starts hitting closer to home	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
yeah they're a lot more strict	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
you uh have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the University of Texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school	2316	B
i- i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in Texas it's next to free because they- they pay so much of it it's state supported	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to MIT my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of MIT and that's it's really too bad	2316	B
but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and college- junior colleges that don't have the background for an MIT kind of curriculum so	2316	B
<silence>	2316	B
	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
well as a matter of fact i just got rid of a car because of the requirement to do some major repairs	2398	B
um i had a Ford Escort with about ninety five thousand miles on it and the engine was shot um	2398	B
i i think the problem was uh the head gasket needed to be replaced	2398	B
and um	2398	B
but nobody would do just the head gasket everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
right and um	2398	B
um	2398	B
i did get the water pump was shot at the same time so i got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until i could sell the car um	2398	B
which i which surprisingly the car was in great demand um in fact i had a bunch of people come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk i was amazed	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
i guess so um but- i ended up buying a um a used car to replace it i got a uh eighty five Dodge Aries which only had thirty four thousand miles on it	2398	B
and uh speaking of repair problems um this car has a has an interesting problem that nobody seems to be able to fix do do you fix cars	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
wow	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
but do you do anything yourself i mean	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
okay	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
right	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah yeah	2398	B
i don't think that's the kind of thing you can do yourself is it unless you had the equipment	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
oh	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah what now what state are you in	2398	B
Texas you're in Texas so am i	2398	B
um yeah the the problem i have with this Dodge uh this Dodge Aries is that if i drive the car for reasonable period of time enough to get the car heated up	2398	B
and then i run to- run out to do a quick errand and jump back into the car it won't start	2398	B
and it won't start until the car is cooled off	2398	B
i've learned that	2398	B
and as soon as it cools- cools off it'll start right up	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
what was the problem	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
oh	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah somebody said that um	2398	B
that uh there must- there's probably some kind of short in the starter	2398	B
and that when the car heats up it uh the metal expands to create the short	2398	B
and then it- it- it isn't until the car cools down that the metal you know these two pieces aren't touching any more and and uh and your you you know then it'll start because you don't have the short	2398	B
but i've taken it to a mechanic and and he started to look at it in fact i drove it out there and i said i bet you anything if you go try start the car right now you won't be able to start it sure enough he couldn't and they had to push it into the garage	2398	B
but they started uh tracing the wires back to see if they could find any shorts or anything and after they fiddled with the wires the problem didn't uh didn't recur- recur	2398	B
they couldn't get it to fail	2398	B
and sure enough after i'd taken it home for you know a couple of weeks after that i didn't have the problem	2398	B
but now it's starting to recur again	2398	B
so it's just one of those weird things i mean he was willing- he said well i think it's in the ignition switch it'll only cost you eighty five dollars but i won't guarantee that's the problem	2398	B
uh yeah and i'm going well- well- i don't want to gamble so i just let the car cool off until i get a hard failure	2398	B
and then uh	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
well that's that's that's reassuring i've never had a Dodge before	2398	B
and i mean it seems like a nice little car it's a great deal it only had thirty four thousand miles on it	2398	B
and otherwise it doesn't give me any problems at all	2398	B
you won't oh yeah	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
oh really Holy mackerel	2398	B
oh jeez	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
 i've you know i've actually had a lot of luck with Fords um um i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and claim that they're the best cars in the world but	2398	B
yeah i mean this this Escort even when the head gasket went i mean it would start first time every time	2398	B
and uh	2398	B
uh so i've- i've just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a Ford dealership and that makes things a little easier come car time but	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
 i just uh i was just talking to somebody who'd had a some kind of i think he had a Cutlass	2398	B
and he had a hundred and ninety five thousand miles on it and finally- the thing finally went	2398	B
so he goes out and he buys a Lexus	2398	B
and i'm going whoa he he moved up	2398	B
yeah i mean you know he's single he's approaching fifty years old	2398	B
he doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on	2398	B
so but uh i can't- i just can't imagine i mean are those cars worth thirty or forty thousand dollars	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
really	2398	B
well it's funny because talk about car repairs i was getting my oil changed and i was sitting in the little lobby it's one of these you know five minute change places	2398	B
and this guy comes storming into the lobby there and he says um	2398	B
you know you guys advertise a twenty dollar oil change and you charged me thirty dollars	2398	B
and the guy says well yeah but you got a Mercedes Benz and it takes a special oil filter	2398	B
and the guy was oh yeah he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten bucks to get his oil changed i'm going	2398	B
i don't think that's worth it i don't think spending an extra you know twenty thousand dollars for a car is worth it you know i don't know	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah oh yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
 oh jeez	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
what	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah yeah	2398	B
i couldn't i tried to do that with my Escort but there's no way to change to get that oil filter out without that i could figure out without getting underneath the car	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
ooh	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
oh yeah i'd prefer to do it but the Escort was very difficult for me to get under and i didn't want to put it up on ramps or anything it just made me nervous	2398	B
i mean can you crawl underneath there or is it	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
hum	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah i just couldn't yeah	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
i think this uh the the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on i think	2398	B
at least i'm going to give it a try cause you can see- i mean the oil filters i mean you can touch it it's right there	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
you've got jacks it makes me nervous	2398	B
	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
whoa whoa	2398	B
yeah yeah hm	2398	B
well i i you know it's just a that's the biggest hassle	2398	B
i think that if i had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff i could have probably gotten another ten thousand miles out of it	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
wow wow	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
gee	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
all right	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
right right	2398	B
well i bet you i bet i mean if it's in good condition and stuff you could probably get a pretty good blue book price	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
well	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
the paint- paint job yeah if you're going to look a new car what would you look at	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
<silence>	2398	B
	2398	B
well what what what brand i mean what model would you look	2398	B
	2398	A
have you had any uh major uh car repairs done recently	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
so you're saying that the repairs would have cost more than the car was worth	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
i think any car that runs right now is in demand	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh i work on my own i've got an nineteen eighty Trans Am that i've had uh since it was new	2398	A
and i've had very good luck with it uh haven't had many repairs done at all the alternator went out four years ago and uh the i had to replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty three	2398	A
but uh other than a few transmission leaks that i got repaired uh i really haven't had anything but uh regular maintenance	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication	2398	A
but if any major problems say like uh transmission leaks i took it in for that	2398	A
and i had to have an alignment done last year so i had that done	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh not really it's not too easy	2398	A
i had past uh state inspection uh just last month so	2398	A
and i had a turn signal out so i had to take it in to get the turn signal fixed but uh other than that for passing inspection uh they gave me a shopping list of things i needed to get done	2398	A
namely uh replacing- putting the catalytic converter back on the car	2398	A
and fixing the emergency brake	2398	A
so those things i could do myself it wasn't a problem	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
Texas	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
i had that problem with a nineteen sixty eight Camaro	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
i never did get it fixed	2398	A
it it could be the starter that it just gets too hot	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
yeah	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
hm	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
yeah	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
right they never do	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
i've heard of that problem with many other different cars doesn't seem to be prevalent with just one manufacturer	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
i won't buy a Dodge	2398	A
my dad had one he had a Dodge	2398	A
six hundred and after thirty thousand miles the head gasket went out	2398	A
nothing but problems with it so he finally traded it in and actually bought a Ford Escort	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
oh a lot of people do like Fords yeah	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
sure	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
yep	2398	A
i'm ready for a new car myself but i've had this car for eleven years and it's given me such little trouble that i i i don't think i could get an adequate replacement that would uh cause me to let- huh	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
i guess that's what about thirty forty thousand dollars	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
right	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
 i guess not	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
i have no idea i know they're they're engineered very well but i would have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
right	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
no dealers will get- get you on the oil changes anyway i took my car in one time many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me thirty dollars for it	2398	A
they they gave me this cock and bull story that because there was a turbo charger on the car they had to prime the turbine with the oil	2398	A
and it's it's it's a bunch of hog wash i- i've changed the oil myself i've put a filter on you know put the oil in and all it's no problem at all	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
no i have to get under my car to get the oil filter out but yeah you change it four times a year it's not that big a deal filter you can buy that on sale for two dollars uh the oil um less than a dollar- dollar- less than a dollar a dollar a quart it's really not that	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
right	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
well i can get the filter off just by laying down underneath the car i can't crawl under it the clearance isn't enough but enough to reach under and get the filter off it's not a problem	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
yeah	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
uh-huh for anything else i'll put the car up on jack stands	2398	A
oh yeah	2398	A
when putting the catalytic converter back on i had to put the right side of the car up on jack stands	2398	A
but it wasn't a real problem	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
yeah every three thousand miles i'll change the oil i've got about ninety four thousand miles on the car right now	2398	A
and uh its working just fine i don't have any problems at all so i'm going to keep it uh i get offers every now and then from	2398	A
from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car because it's a Trans Am they're high school seniors seventeen years old and they got to impress their girl friend	2398	A
the trouble is they think they can buy it for a thousand dollars or less	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
yeah it's in great shape uh body is in excellent shape it just needs paint i need to look up some place to uh to get the car painted	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
a new car	2398	A
oh i'm not- i don't think i'm in the new car market	2398	A
a new car that really hard pick	2398	A
<silence>	2398	A
	2312	A
so what TV shows do you like do you like comedies or	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
uh-huh	2312	A
do you like uh do you like Cheers	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
Cheers-	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
Night Court	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah i i think that's pretty much what i like is my favorite TV show is Cheers and then after that is uh Night Court	2312	A
but i also i also like Star Trek and that's kind of an adventure i guess you would call it	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah that's true	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah especially like uh have you have you seen that movie uh Dances with Wolves	2312	A
you don't want to see it it's like three hours long and it just drags on forever	2312	A
well i like i mean i like you know things that are funny and and and don't you know like like Cheers you know is really funny it it makes you laugh or you know so it's not like uh uh a show that goes on forever even though it's only half an hour	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah something to remove you know something to remove me from reality for a little while get away from real life	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
 because_1 i i mean i don't know it's just something i think something we need	2312	A
	2312	A
as you know as human beings something to remove you from reality to relieve the stress	2312	A
and Cheers does it i don't know i like the way i like the way the people act in Cheers it's it's pretty funny it's it's kind of you know the extremes of of certain characters	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah the syndicate	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah they when when they'll show one one episode in one channel and like in the next day they'll show it on another one	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
right where i where i where i'm at right now is in a dorm and we don't have the uh we don't have cable so i just get regular TV but	2312	A
we see it uh every day at six o'clock	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah right and then the new one comes on at nine Thursdays	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
well how about the Wonder Years do you like the Wonder Years	2312	A
that's pretty good i mean it's it's not something you see every day so it's i guess it that that keeps the quality a little higher	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
uh-huh so it's even closer to you	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
uh-huh	2312	A
i never ever really got into Bob Newhart	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
no i don't i don't i never never saw that	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
i kind of i kind of stayed away from the TV for a couple of years when i first came up here	2312	A
so i you know there's a gap in my TV viewing but recently that's basically what i watch is Cheers and	2312	A
and uh	2312	A
and Night Court because they're right- they show them back to back	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
well	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
no i don't i don't i don't particularly get into those shows because it's they're they- they don't keep my interest i- i've seen um L A Law i think once or twice and and the episode wasn't that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i don't waste my time	2312	A
looking at that and you know and if it's if it's funny or if it keeps my interest if it's exciting i'll watch it if not i don't and times that i saw that or pieces of that it wasn't any wasn't great	2312	A
Thirty Something i watched a few times because_1 there was a few good episodes and then after that it it i just lost interest in it	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
but uh i guess it's because it's not aimed for an audience of my age	2312	A
no i'm i'm in my twenties my early twenties and so	2312	A
i guess Thirty Something is not is definitely not for me	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
uh-huh	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah well	2312	A
that that way you'll you'll get to see all the shows and you get to really form good opinions on which one is really good and which one is is really	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
what was wise guy	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
oh	2312	A
i mean i heard of it before but i never i never seen it	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
did you have you ever seen that that show they i mean they they trashed it before it ever got started but it was like i think they showed a couple of shows of uh what is it a Cop Rocks or something like that	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
i heard i heard it really sucked	2312	A
because uh it was supposed to be something like a show- uh singing and like like a musical but yeah	2312	A
like a musical like right in the middle of acting they would sing songs or something	2312	A
no	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
i can see why it crashed	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
well it was nice talking to you	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
 yeah	2312	A
<silence>	2312	A
oh well i'll get off the phone and let you watch it then and good luck on your recovery	2312	A
all right bye	2312	A
	2312	A
	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
i like comedies and i like sitcoms i like to watch TV for escape i'm not much interested in	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
 yeah i like that and i like L A Law and i like Thirty Something	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
i like Night Court	2312	B
in fact it's on right now	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah i never really got involved in Star Trek	2312	B
and i don't really care to watch movies because	2312	B
it's committing too much time i think	2312	B
you know you never know what's going to come up you know if you commit thirty minutes or an hour to watch some TV shows it's a little different than	2312	B
you know two hours for a movie especially you know things that are i hate things that are continued	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
no i haven't	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
that's what i've heard	2312	B
	2312	B
i think	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah and it's a just a nice escape	2312	B
and you know it's something to laugh at and enjoy and	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
right	2312	B
exactly	2312	B
exactly that's that's what i like	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah yeah you're right about the other you're right they are now that i think about it	2312	B
yeah i watch it it's on here- it's on here um like three or four times a night on various cable channels	2312	B
	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
well yeah but right- um let's see here they've got it	2312	B
they've got it at like six six or six thirty and then they have it again at ten and ten thirty you know on a different channel	2312	B
and so you know	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
oh okay	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
uh-huh the older one	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
i'm trying to think what other shows i like there there's just oh just television has changed so much and uh	2312	B
 there's just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be	2312	B
i guess a lot of people think that the shows that i watch are kind of stupid and most of my friends and the people i know don't	2312	B
yeah i like that	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
well yeah and what i like about that show is that the time the time period that that takes place in is exactly the age i was during that time period so	2312	B
yeah it's kind of funny to you know sit back and remember it brings back a lot of memories	2312	B
um	2312	B
i don't know i like do you like um i don't know if if you're	2312	B
you would know like Barney Miller do you ever	2312	B
watch that or the old Bob Newhart Show	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
never got into those	2312	B
the old- i'm talking about the old one when he was a psychologist	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
don't remember those	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
i don't know my friends don't like my TV TV they think it's trashy but uh	2312	B
well yeah	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
back to back when i was in college you know we didn't have TVs	2312	B
and so i remember somebody happened to have one in their room it was a really big deal and everybody'd get together like one night a week to watch TV but	2312	B
	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
but uh	2312	B
sounds like we have real similar tastes- we have- tastes i mean as far as the sitcoms go do you what about the do you like L A Law or	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
is that all	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
uh-huh	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
um	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah probably not	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
about ten years	2312	B
yeah ten years down the road for you but um	2312	B
those are really the only two drama shows that i like	2312	B
and i tell everybody don't call me	2312	B
but other than that i you know i like i um i'm recovering from surgery and so i read and watch a lot of television so	2312	B
i get to see just about everything	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah but who cares about my opinion	2312	B
i like the uh	2312	B
i don't know it seems like that some of the best shows they take off the air one of my favorite shows was Wise Guy and they took that off the air	2312	B
it was a cop show	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
but	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
yeah i have to stay up if i want to see it i have to stay up till eleven thirty and then it's all reruns and the guy that was started out in it isn't in it and anyway it's a long	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
i heard a lot about it but i never saw it now	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
did it	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
oh really	2312	B
	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
you're kidding	2312	B
maybe i should have surely it maybe it would have been pretty funny i don't know	2312	B
i don't think it was supposed to be funny though	2312	B
you know	2312	B
nice talking to you i guess you'll get to watch all of Night Court	2312	B
	2312	B
<silence>	2312	B
i'm sorry i'm just teasing thanks	2312	B
bye bye	2312	B
	2312	B
<silence>	2342	B
so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
yeah	2342	B
well yeah that's probably true i i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time they're going to come from there	2342	B
uh i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that that's that's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
really	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
that'd be interesting because_1 i um i actually um um i'm i'm i'm Jewish and i'm actually sort of not not- not not not really a Zionist per se you know i'm not	2342	B
but i have a um	2342	B
i have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know Israel should it's his right and they do whatever they want and i think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing	2342	B
and uh you know in some sense may- the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
right then- then then it then is it worth it at all	2342	B
i mean i i because_1 the way i mean sort of the way to think about it is well	2342	B
they won you know they sort of took over the um	2342	B
they're one of the only countries in in in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didn't start	2342	B
basically so	2342	B
so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it but um but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
um probably oh isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
i just heard something about moving recently about moving um	2342	B
there there there's some central command post in Tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East	2342	B
actually there was um a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in Saudi Arabia or or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think	2342	B
and i they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to um	2342	B
i guess it's i guess it's so that so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it	2342	B
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
that's true	2342	B
 yeah	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
yeah that they- they- they claim that's why we're still there i mean you know why only you note it's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet	2342	B
but i think that's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what's happening in Iraq right now	2342	B
you know just in itself it it it being so crazy there	2342	B
i have no idea what i mean what do you know just to imagine that one day they're going to turn around and someone's going to say we don't like you and just start attacking again and	2342	B
it's going to be worse	2342	B
i don't know um	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
no i don't i have- i i have some friends in Israel and and coincidently actually my wife is Syrian um	2342	B
yeah so i am we are sort of we are the Middle East peace talks at home um	2342	B
and uh pardon me i'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now in the background but we um we	2342	B
she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia actually- well friends in Saudi Arabia and um i have some friends in Israel and we we talk a bit about it but we try and keep it out of out of the home life	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
no she was she's actually um	2342	B
i think it's um for her not not really relevant because she was she's second generation American actually	2342	B
	2342	B
her parents who were born here would like to go see it though i think they would like to go to Syria but but they recognize that Syria's not the place that one wants to visit	2342	B
right about now	2342	B
you know just something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
yeah i i'd actually been there um i was there a couple years ago when it wasn't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess	2342	B
and i do i do- i do like it actually um i would never live there i think i'm too Americanized and um sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of	2342	B
the- the easy life but i do like the food	2342	B
if that if so	2342	B
if that if if that amounts for anything	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
yeah actually my house is Kosher but um it turns out that one- one of the strangest things about about Israel is that	2342	B
no um most folks don't realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know Jewish food and so forth um	2342	B
and you know um in general really isn't the food that is eaten in Israel so you you i'm sure you probably typically think of it like bagels right you know bagels and lox	2342	B
	2342	B
turns out you don't you don't you don't really find bagels in Israel what you find is sort of Middle Eastern foods the same foods that you find in um Syria and Egypt and everything else you find things called have you ever had those	2342	B
which is	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
oh oh knishes no you don't you- you you don't see a lot of that that's basically Eastern European Jewish food	2342	B
it's it's very different i'm i i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured this out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasn't Israeli it was more Jewish you know	2342	B
it it it it is very strange um	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
that that starts tomorrow night	2342	B
that's what i'm making that's what i'm doing now i'm making dinner	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
ought to buy the bread from	2342	B
that's great well you've you've you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed you	2342	B
got got the vocabulary down and everything	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
that that that's actually real good yeah we um we actually we have the reverse situation turns out that um um most of my friends aren't Jewish and and and my wife's not but i	2342	B
but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things so so that um Seder's you know our our first Seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which and five of them will be Jewish	2342	B
two two years ago we had a Seder we had sixteen people each night	2342	B
sixteen seems the magic number for us	2342	B
and i was the only Jew both nights	2342	B
 so	2342	B
 so which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get these to see this um	2342	B
so get to see it and my view is	2342	B
Passover is should sort of be in- in in in in in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates Christ	2342	B
so	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
oh yeah i caught the end of that	2342	B
yeah every year i try and catch that	2342	B
but yeah that's what always amazes me actually is that um	2342	B
is that you know my my wife and i always sort of bring this up about she- her her being Syrian you know and my being Jewish and all we look alike we act alike we sound alike well not totally alike but you know	2342	B
um um it's amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
right	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
right that that's actually the part that that that i find really strange i mean i i i sort of understand somewhat i mean i i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the Muslims for you know the Israelis or whatever and i can sort of handle i can sort of handle that and the Palestinians	2342	B
but i sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around having jihads against themselves	2342	B
you know i mean and and that seems really weird	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
right exactly	2342	B
same same thing	2342	B
i don't i'll i'll i'll never understand it uh my view is look what'd you ever do to me	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
didn't hurt me you know at at at the moment so um and and i i don't know there's a there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not um um Everything I Ever Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten	2342	B
have you ever seen this and it talks about how you know if we could just all get together- you know when we were young everything was great because_1 we you know just sort of all went to class together and in the middle- you know we all had snack time together and then we all took naps and we all held hands and hugged	2342	B
you know and that's- and that's- and that's what that's what kindergarten was like and wouldn't it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and and took a nap together	2342	B
woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other as- as we left	2342	B
<silence>	2342	B
yeah i wonder if he secretly did that	2342	B
	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
	2342	A
well actually i think it's good i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there	2342	A
uh because_1 i think without peace we're not going to get uh stable oil prices and	2342	A
and uh i'd i'd really like to see stability in in that area because_1 i'm always afraid that's where uh another big war is going to start	2342	A
not that Desert Storm was a small one	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
i saw um just recently where uh uh the US is supposedly going to be uh putting pressure on all the you know the Israelis supposedly to to come to a bargaining table to uh	2342	A
actually i heard that the Israelis were even talking- at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
okay	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
well uh i guess it's one of those things that uh if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
oh yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
do you think the US is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
i i haven't heard that i i watch CNN every once in a while but i i haven't specifically heard anything about that	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
what i thought was interesting is that uh apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet	2342	A
and uh well i guess there's still the possibility that uh hostilities with uh US troops could still break out	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
do you have relatives over in Israel	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
oh really	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
do you uh does- does she ever want to go back to Syria	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
oh okay	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
no	2342	A
no	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
do you ever want to go over to Israel	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
oh okay	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
	2342	A
 okay well who you know do you have uh a lot of Kosher foods there at your house	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
um-hum	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah no no no uh kishkes or knishes or	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
oh	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
i got you	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
still get your Passover Matzi and all that right	2342	A
	2342	A
oh really i dated uh i dated a nice Jewish girl for many years up in Chicago	2342	A
and i was the only Goyim at at all the you know Seder dinners and everything and i used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would sell me	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
 not not	2342	A
 yeah not uh just just enough to get by	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
okay	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
oh	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
 wow	2342	A
oh really	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
well they had the matter of fact i just watched uh Charles Heston this uh this weekend in the Ten Commandments	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
did you	2342	A
	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
well that's uh to me it's it's really um	2342	A
i- i- i guess i guess i can intellectually uh kind of come to grips with all of that but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that uh	2342	A
that that people that believe in God and and love not war and to forgive can't get together	2342	A
you know i mean- i i know that the problems are so deep but i mean even- even within the Muslim uh religions different sects they can't get together	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
or the uh the the you know the Catholics and the Protestants up in Ireland	2342	A
you know i mean i- i	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
 yeah yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
yeah	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
it sounds like a it sounds like a John Lennon uh type	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
gosh	2342	A
<silence>	2342	A
	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
all right i agree with that people that are uh driving	2314	B
like uh truck drivers and things like that i definitely think they should be tested and and i'm not i'm not opposed to any testing i mean	2314	B
because i know i certainly wouldn't want to uh	2314	B
you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or you know because he was on drugs while he was there	2314	B
uh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
oh um	2314	B
i was tested uh	2314	B
within my company i think it's it's- it's- kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because_1 i don't know of any other countries that are doing this	2314	B
and i feel- i feel like it's really just within the United States it's um	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
it's okay i think your record should stand for itself that	2314	B
you know if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and	2314	B
especially if your personality proves that you're not	2314	B
i think they could uh save money by not doing that	2314	B
you know every time say if you change jobs that- you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
oh right-	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh not if it's done fairly and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
yeah	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
well they might tell you it's random	2314	B
but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries	2314	B
you know	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
oh i see how'd how did they how do they pick their people	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
oh i see so do you	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right	2314	B
well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them_1	2314	B
to be tested	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right right	2314	B
yeah it would almost be like a	2314	B
a uh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative	2314	B
and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right	2314	B
i agree with that	2314	B
because_1 i know personally myself i've been in the same job for	2314	B
three years it'll be three years in August and i've already been drug tested three times	2314	B
	2314	B
well i'm an environmental engineer	2314	B
and i've been drug tested three times and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus	2314	B
so see i i for some reason i've come up three times that's pretty high statistics	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
no no not at all it-	2314	B
it's a legal job you know	2314	B
so see it's really strange	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
oh uh-huh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right	2314	B
well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for before- before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her and and she came up negative	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
yeah	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
right right	2314	B
yeah	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
yeah	2314	B
and are they tested random	2314	B
they're	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
oh okay	2314	B
i see	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
yeah	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
oh i see	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh	2314	B
okay_1 so they know that and they	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
uh-huh okay_1	2314	B
<silence>	2314	B
well	2314	B
 yeah	2314	B
i think so yeah seven twenty five	2314	B
okay nice speaking to you	2314	B
okay- bye	2314	B
	2314	B
<silence>	2314	A
well i i don't think that it's it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions for instance	2314	A
jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's where there's uh endangerment to their own life and other people's lives	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um-hum	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um-hum	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
yeah	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
well how do you feel- how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um-hum	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um-hum	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um-hum	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
well what about random testing though	2314	A
do- do you feel like that's an invasion- invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
i don't know that you do if it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um-hum	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
yeah	2314	A
well i happen- i know that for instance in the NC double A they drug test and it's not random	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh	2314	A
at the NC double A does have something to do with it but it's almost	2314	A
discretionary on the coach's part of each individual- individually individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem	2314	A
and- and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
well not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights if someone's	2314	A
having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to have- behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
it's an accusation and and it's and it's based- based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave	2314	A
uh normal uh you know	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
right exactly it- it i don't	2314	A
the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
um-hum	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
what type of job do you have	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
uh-huh	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
well does your job- require- does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger- endanger someone	2314	A
well it that doesn't i- i mean i- i	2314	A
uh-huh	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
hum that is odd i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job	2314	A
uh but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well the job i have have now requested my uh uh	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
my uh medical record from my old company	2314	A
so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
well no i don't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didn't i mean they- they don't know that i don't use drugs they just tested me once	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen	2314	A
uh were clean	2314	A
and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly regularly- uh just across the board	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
no they're all of them_1 are tested once every three months- it's a rotation	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
but it but again it depends on what job you're in the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot	2314	A
and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much	2314	A
but but see they make that clear to them_1 as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
yeah it's it's made very clear upon hiring	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
well have we spent our at least five minutes okay	2314	A
<silence>	2314	A
okay	2314	A
nice to talk to you too bye-bye	2314	A
	2314	A
	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
no i have two children i have a two year old and a three and a half year old	2325	B
really that's wild	2325	B
	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh boy well mine was two in March and the three and a half year old will be four in in July	2325	B
	2325	B
but i'm home with the kids all day and i have really um	2325	B
tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us	2325	B
but	2325	B
pretty much pretty much uh i work part-time but uh my husband's able you know mostly to take care of them when i'm working so uh but we adopted these two little guys and that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because_1 you know they have had a	2325	B
couple foster homes already	2325	B
the baby was eleven weeks old and his brother was twenty twenty two months	2325	B
yeah so	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
um-hum	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh boy	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh that's mean	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
that's the hardest thing i think you know to to deal with is that people love your kids i put um	2325	B
my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and you know that kind of thing and uh he was in there for three months when i pulled him out	2325	B
and the the teacher had eleven kids it was excellent supposedly the reputation was fantastic for this place was supposed to be an excellent school and i had several friends who had had recommended it too but it really gets down to the particular teacher	2325	B
and she was a new teacher at the school and she had eleven you know three year olds in a room and i just think it was way too much they were almost all boys	2325	B
pardon	2325	B
i didn't think much i don't think much	2325	B
yeah and she was just my uh three year old is real active and she just kept saying how wild he was well you know there was kind of a connotation there of him being	2325	B
	2325	B
there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more and it's really hard to control- you can't control eleven three year olds with one person you know yeah you know	2325	B
so i just finally took him out plus financial reasons it was expensive but i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time but i still felt like even after all the checking i did	2325	B
you know you really can't know everything about what's going to happen i felt safe that	2325	B
the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them you know because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms and i felt like	2325	B
that was a big factor for me that they would would be safe you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
uh-huh	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh gosh	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
so you had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh gosh	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh yeah i was i took the kids there once just to try it they had a free day at Kindercare yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
uh-hum	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
i didn't either i had one bad i had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him	2325	B
and the other one was that the the younger one got bit	2325	B
really badly by another child and what they did was they took my	2325	B
younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day	2325	B
	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
so you feel like your values aren't getting yeah yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah yeah God loves you you know basic things like that	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
um-hum	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
wow	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh what luck	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
 really	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh that's great	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
oh really wow	2325	B
that's okay i got the dryer going in the background so	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
oh that's great	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah yeah	2325	B
at least they think it's fun it's not a big you know trauma to them to learn something yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
really because_1 sometimes it is a burden having them all day because i can't do anything with them here i can't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them_1 because the baby is so	2325	B
into everything and the older brother is you know running around all over the place so it is a yeah yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
	2325	B
because_1 some of the churches do have them um you know for like six dollars per child and that's not that big a deal you know for a couple times	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
yeah	2325	B
yep	2325	B
sounds good yeah	2325	B
<silence>	2325	B
well thanks did we cover everything we need	2325	B
	2325	B
okay	2325	B
okay	2325	B
yeah okay well great well thanks a lot you have a good day bye-bye	2325	B
	2325	B
	2325	A
okay so uh then do you keep kids is this two year old yours or do you keep children for other people	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
oh that's exactly what i have yes	2325	A
i know i my my little girl was three and a half in March and my son was two in January	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
that's pretty close	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yes it is have you been able to do that all along or	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
oh how neat	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
how old were they when you adopted	2325	A
so he probably doesn't remember	2325	A
oh yeah definitely needed well that's that's pretty interesting well i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know that was always my dream you know i wasn't necessarily a career person	2325	A
but as long as i was single and had to work i was going to get a good job and do the best i could and my husband was in the type of business that you know it's insurance so you have to build a clientele and by the time we had kids i couldn't quit	2325	A
and so i haven't been able to quit yet so i've had to deal a lot with child care and course we're hoping within hopefully the next two years i'll be able to quit and stay home	2325	A
but um i started out um my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in August and it worked out pretty good you know we had always said from the beginning that	2325	A
if it gets in the way of the friendship then i'll take them_1 somewhere else you know the friendship is more important	2325	A
 and uh it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them you know she loved them like they were hers and i- i knew you know i had good peace of mind i knew that they were taken care of and	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
uh-huh	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yes	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
huh	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
and she had no help	2325	A
she had no help she was alone with them	2325	A
 oh that is hard	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
gee	2325	A
i don't either	2325	A
so	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
you have to let them_1 have some wild time if that's considered wild	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
right	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
right	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yes	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
well when when my friend decided to go back to work and whenever we had problems it worked out okay because_1 she would come and tell me and we'd work it out	2325	A
after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy and i thought well you know we'll try her but she came to our house and that just did not work	2325	A
uh i mean she loved the kids and she was good with them but	2325	A
uh you know they were filthy when i'd get home now i understand kids go out and play and they get dirty but i mean filthy i'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair and the and i was like gosh and then	2325	A
you know my own furniture and stuff was like you know the kitchen table the i'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs and the and clean and i was like	2325	A
yeah and then in the end um she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth she told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a Friday that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning	2325	A
well you know i work eight to five thirty so what am i supposed to do	2325	A
so i well i had been sick and i it ended up that i didn't go to work Monday because i was sick so i stayed home with them_1 and we went to some of the KinderCares	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yeah well that's what they said there were two pretty near our house and they said well bring them_1 in this week for a free day so i lined up someone Tuesday they had a Mother's Day Out that my babysitter took them_1 to you know which was fine they liked it they'd been going to it for years	2325	A
and so i stayed with them Monday Tuesday they went to that Wednesday i took them_1 to one Kindercare Thursday i took them_1 to another KinderCare and then on Friday my husband and i split but on Thursday i didn't like the KinderCare's they	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
they didn't give him	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
oh	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
oh that's horrible	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
and doing something with him well not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which i didn't have you know i didn't i you know we're we're a Christian family and you know they because they're you know	2325	A
	2325	A
yeah yeah basic so um i talked to another lady-	2325	A
lady at church it was like Thursday of that week and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter and i've know this girl i went to college with her so i really i you i- i value her opinion	2325	A
and she told me about a private one it it was associated with one of the churches here it's not the church i go to but it's you know it it was Lubbock View Christian Church and it's a private academy	2325	A
and so i went over there and i talked to the lady well they have like a three year waiting list but she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time	2325	A
and she said i should know something by tomorrow which is Friday and she said if she leaves she said i'll let you have her spot	2325	A
and so Friday afternoon at five thirty she called me and she said she's going you can bring your kids Monday	2325	A
i know i was just like God set this up for me he knew i needed this and uh so since October then they've been going there and	2325	A
i- i love it i have been at such peace with myself it's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles and	2325	A
	2325	A
being a private institution they're nonprofit	2325	A
so they don't have to charge as much and the hours are wonderful and i just i think it's the best thing i told Russ yesterday- that we should have done this a long time ago	2325	A
you know It's great So i guess as long as i have to work i feel good that they're there they're getting the love the care They have a little curriculum They teach them	2325	A
you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn If they don't they don't i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three but it's kind of neat when they come home with it you know and	2325	A
uh	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
oh and the teachers love Taylor got bit several times and Taylor bit several times and the teachers dealt with that we're like hey they're two and we keep them apart and we scold them and we correct them and you know they mark it all down and they let you know and	2325	A
and you know they get over it real quick and he doesn't do it anymore and	2325	A
they work at the potty training- i just just so much- i don't know i just feel like a big burden was lifted so	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
it is	2325	A
i know	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
i know and that's hard	2325	A
yeah well and it it you know but i understand- i i i wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your peace of mind also	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
<silence>	2325	A
yeah	2325	A
yeah and that's usually like you know i don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out it was like from nine to three so that was a pretty good pretty good time you know my babysitter would take them and then pick them up	2325	A
so that worked out real good	2325	A
well i'm tickled to death i hope you find something and it was good talking to you	2325	A
well i guess it said child care criteria and i think we both listed it and experiences	2325	A
and you too bye	2325	A
	2325	A
the taxes tend to uh keep going up but	2341	A
uh i don't know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well there's always someone that's that's worse off in what they end up paying	2341	A
but uh go ahead	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
yeah i'm still still i'm able to survive and	2341	A
and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money it's almost like you're paying your own salary i don't work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and	2341	A
being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days it's still uh	2341	A
still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way	2341	A
uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh	2341	A
a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and	2341	A
and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area it's still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes	2341	A
people	2341	A
desire that that money not be spent well	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
no no Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet that's	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
well by the time the city gets involved i'm not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent	2341	A
so it's it's pretty pretty much but i think it's divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
and it's it's quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere	2341	A
but we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes	2341	A
yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of	2341	A
lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so it's	2341	A
it's a real mixed blessing i guess to	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
yeah it'd be nice if you could find someone	2341	A
oh	2341	A
uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then you'd have to find a way to make it work	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
yeah yeah	2341	A
the uh bureaucracy seems to spend	2341	A
more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh	2341	A
an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases	2341	A
so it make	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
yeah	2341	A
and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on	2341	A
to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and we'll have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever	2341	A
and they just keep trying to to	2341	A
close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all they're doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and	2341	A
and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
um-hum	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
right	2341	A
it does seem to be the case	2341	A
i don't know whether it's worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a	2341	A
hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every	2341	A
dollar you make or spend it gets uh	2341	A
steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then	2341	A
just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everything's going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction	2341	A
i don't know what what would happen if we	2341	A
uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much	2341	A
uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving it's not a	2341	A
you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff	2341	A
but if you put the burden on	2341	A
the retailer who really doesn't care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesn't care who bought the groceries you're going to pay the tax on it	2341	A
so most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our income- income brackets	2341	A
so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would	2341	A
pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didn't save they wouldn't have to get or what they could- could save they wouldn't get taxed on	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
yeah but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward	2341	A
a particular type of savings you wouldn't be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know	2341	A
avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRA's and all that they	2341	A
you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money	2341	A
and it didn't have the taxation problem well you might	2341	A
might do all right i don't know it seems	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
yeah	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
that's for sure	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
right	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway so	2341	A
you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away	2341	A
yeah the uh	2341	A
the taxes are are	2341	A
kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things we've written into it but uh looking- looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there	2341	A
it's not all that pleasant anywhere	2341	A
	2341	A
yeah pretty much	2341	A
well i hear one of my {kiddos} doing something they shouldn't be so i'll uh let you go and maybe-	2341	A
maybe- maybe we'll catch each other again	2341	A
<silence>	2341	A
i'll try bye	2341	A
	2341	A
<silence>	2341	B
i think i think we're always convinced that we're paying too much in taxes	2341	B
without getting back necessarily everything we'd like to but so far	2341	B
i don't think i've paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
yes	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
right	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
right	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
do you all pay state income tax	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part they've just started talking about introducing a state income tax	2341	B
and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
wow	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
right	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
well that's good	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
that's i think that's the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots	2341	B
and i- i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic can't see the forest for the trees i- i wonder if if they realize	2341	B
the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
and i don't i don't think they're getting their money's worth and i- i- i definitely don't think that the added	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think it's just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws	2341	B
they will find a way	2341	B
if they want to badly enough they'll either find it themselves or they'll find someone to do it for them	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
right	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
right	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
yeah	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
yeah even if you didn't invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest	2341	B
you- you'd still be ahead	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
and that's something that's something i need to- to learn a lot more about is is	2341	B
under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future	2341	B
because that's a that's a scary thought you always hear that Social Security won't be around by the time	2341	B
we're sixty three or sixty five and and need it and that's a scary thought	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
no	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
we still look pretty good don't we	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
 okay	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
it's been nice talking to you	2341	B
<silence>	2341	B
okay have a good evening	2341	B
thanks bye-bye	2341	B
	2341	B
	2339	B
okay i was thinking about camping and different i- people's ideas about it	2339	B
 we've even seen people with these campers and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their TV when they're going but that's not	2339	B
 yeah a satellite dish	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
oh golly that's not the kind we do do you go camping	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
	2339	B
well so do we in fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family	2339	B
 and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks i mean i know it's dangerous i wouldn't do it now but we did	2339	B
 and one time we went to Yellowstone and we were doing the same thing we couldn't find a place to camp and so we were	2339	B
on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess	2339	B
and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there we had our food you know	2339	B
and told us to get inside our car	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
 bear bait	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
yeah	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
yeah we've got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler	2339	B
and go up there fairly often	2339	B
 sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it	2339	B
and we've done things like when when it's kind of cold we take extension cords and we've all got heaters in our tents	2339	B
and in the summer same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents but we've got the fans going	2339	B
so we're not roughing it too much and we have taken TVs out there for the kids	2339	B
and they've got their electrical hookups	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
so it's not so bad	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
i think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days and they even they had a library at one time out there	2339	B
so that's really not roughing it so much but	2339	B
	2339	B
we have gone on trips we've bathed in streams	2339	B
that's kind of different	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
and a pool to go to that would be nice	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends he just decided to take the kids out there	2339	B
i mean it's not very many miles from our house at all	2339	B
	2339	B
had the boat just pulled up right by the tents	2339	B
	2339	B
it wasn't bad	2339	B
yeah and we've taken our tents though loaded them up in the car carrier	2339	B
and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night	2339	B
we'd take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel	2339	B
instead of getting out all that stuff you know	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
 yeah then you have to get up the next day and move it on	2339	B
huh-uh	2339	B
but we're set now we've got cook stoves and we've got our bug light	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
and everybody's got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable	2339	B
yeah those double ones	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
pretty good we're on our third one i think somehow	2339	B
we've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
i didn't know you could do that	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
	2339	B
yeah	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
no joke i hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner	2339	B
	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
yeah now we've used a hair dryer before	2339	B
but i put it on hot and also melted it	2339	B
i found that you don't do that	2339	B
i didn't realize it would melt so easily	2339	B
i don't know	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
yeah	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
i don't like it when there's mosquitoes so bad	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
and then one night we were camping and it came just a torrential downpour we had the steaks on the grill	2339	B
these people were with us and it	2339	B
 i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent it was just that bad you know	2339	B
and we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything	2339	B
so i got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful yeah	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
yeah it was	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
it's horrible	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
you mean that you put on a truck or what	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
oh yeah yeah	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
how many weeks have you been doing these calls	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
i think this must be into my third week too	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
so do you work for TI	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
in a speech lab	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
and what exactly are they going to do	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
so any voice no matter what the	2339	B
speech pattern or the dialect or anything	2339	B
	2339	B
hum	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
i wonder if these are going to be speaking	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
the computers	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
oh that's kind of neat	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
do you put all the uh-hums in here on everything too	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
what do you write for stutter	2339	B
duh duh	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
uh-huh	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
 i guess so unless you want to talk about stakes which kind of stakes to put in	2339	B
you need metal instead of plastic	2339	B
and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time we got one of those kind that have got the	2339	B
oh what is it	2339	B
they're plastic and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles and you just put them together and it's a dome tent	2339	B
that's good isn't it	2339	B
yeah	2339	B
but	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B
um no	2339	B
<silence>	2339	B

<silence>	2339	A

<silence>	2339	A
uh-huh yeah we've uh we camped at the DeGray State Park in Arkansas	2339	A
in the fall and there was nobody else hardly around and it was just really nice	2339	A
that time of year we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable but we didn't need it	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh really	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
yeah	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A

<silence>	2339	A
that sounds nice	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
yeah	2339	A
	2339	A

	2339	A
yeah those are nice we have one of those too uh-huh	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A

<silence>	2339	A
oh we- we were looking at those in a magazine last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
and yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in and you can	2339	A
fill them up that way but it something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
no uh-huh we have a my husband and i we have a pickup truck so there's plenty of room to hold things	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
uh-huh	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh no	2339	A
yeah	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A

oh no	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
uh-huh	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh boy	2339	A
that was lucky	2339	A
we've been lucky we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh i bet it when we were younger when i was a kid we camped in Virginia and	2339	A
we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground	2339	A
but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a year- the year we we were really into camping	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
uh no it's a little trailer you pull behind your car and uh	2339	A
you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and	2339	A
it had two double beds in it	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh since the beginning	2339	A
i guess it's been two or three weeks	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
uh well i work as a temporary in the Speech Lab	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
uh-huh where they're doing this program	2339	A
the voice recognition program	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh they turn them over to somebody and they're going to	2339	A
i guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
right yeah	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
i don't know	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
i type up the tapes of what people talked about	2339	A
yeah it's sort of interesting	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
uh-huh everything like that all the little stutters and everything	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
well i guess that's it for camping huh	2339	A
	2339	A
yeah	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
yeah	2339	A
	2339	A
oh uh-huh that's what we have too yeah that's what ours is	2339	A
yeah yeah they pop up pretty fast	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
have you ever camped on sand	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
that can be a mess we camped at the beach one time and that was sort of miserable	2339	A
you just couldn't- everywhere you went there was sand you couldn't even when you're eating it it was in your bed	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
uh-huh	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
oh	2339	A
	2339	A
	2339	A
uh-huh	2339	A
<silence>	2339	A
okay well it's good talking to you bye	2339	A
	2339	A
do you have any pets	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
you must have a little farm then	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
well i'm a i'm a sort of a city dweller and i got a bunch of kids so they've got to have their pets	2346	A
and uh we've uh lost a few this year but we've still got a dog and a bird left	2346	A
and uh	2346	A
the the kids maul the dog something awful they pull his tail and bend his ears and uh	2346	A
have a good time playing with him and the dog is pretty uh tolerant of them	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
well they're uh seven eight and uh ten	2346	A
and	2346	A
yes well right outside in uh Falls Church Virginia	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
well you've got part of your family up here then	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
well uh i just got a new bird for uh little Deb at uh Christmas time and we're still in the process of uh getting him tamed he's a little parakeet yellow one	2346	A
and uh we let him fly around the house	2346	A
and the dog being a Golden Retriever he he pays close attention whenever that bird is flying around	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
well the the previous bird he uh got a hold of it uh two or three times	2346	A
and uh	2346	A
i found that uh well one occasion i i heard a little noise and i saw the dog walking away and i looked over and i see some feathers sticking out of his mouth	2346	A
and i grabbed the dog by the tail real quick and i discovered if you yank a dog's tail real hard he lets go of a bird	2346	A
	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
bigger bird or a larger cat to take care of the dog	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
well there is a a neighbor of mine used to uh uh know quite a bit about uh raising parakeets	2346	A
and she had uh a lot of connections when it came to getting good birds	2346	A
so she was knowledgeable all the different breeds and colorations and so forth	2346	A
knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet	2346	A
uh i had a parakeet many years ago that uh she got for me	2346	A
and it lived to be a a pretty old bird	2346	A
and was extremely friendly	2346	A
uh i i couldn't keep him in his own cage he just uh flew lose in the house all the time	2346	A
uh but uh more recent years they moved away and i've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop	2346	A
and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
well we found in general when you you look for breeders you don't find them in the uh metropolitan areas	2346	A
they you wind up going many miles out of town to find somebody that's handling whatever it is you're looking for	2346	A
we went looking for uh rabbits	2346	A
and we had to go all the way out to Leesburg to find uh a rabbitry a few years back	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
weren't any uh rabbits available in this area except little bunnies available at the uh pet shops	2346	A
and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
huh	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
that's pretty unusual because we- i've generally found that rabbits have been very uh very good parents	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah we had a rabbit up until uh last summer and we gave him away because the girls lost interest in him and couple of them we're getting allergic to rabbits	2346	A
uh	2346	A
i uh we we had a tough time deciding on a name so i named him uh Mister Tibbar	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
and they wanted to know how i figured out that name and i said well it's rabbit spelled backwards	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
so uh	2346	A
one of my other daughters got a uh gerbil and they came to me for a name and i said well name him Libreg	2346	A
and they said well how did you get that name i said well that's gerbil spelled backwards	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
well they wouldn't let me name the dog	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
	2346	A
well	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah well we had uh i lived on a farm when i was growing up and when we bought the farm there was uh couple of farm cats on the property	2346	A
and they were sort of tame every now and then they'd let you pet them	2346	A
but uh one of the cats which we named Bug Eyes she had a litter of kittens and she kept them away from the uh the house until they were pretty good size kittens	2346	A
and they wouldn't let you get anywhere near them	2346	A
and one day i went over to i found them sleeping and i went over and picked one of them up and it boy it was like picking up a buzz saw	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
but i tried again a few weeks later but this time i put on some leather gloves	2346	A
and my father still wondered what happened to those leather gloves	2346	A
	2346	A
well it's been nice talking to you	2346	A
<silence>	2346	A
all right	2346	A
bye	2346	A
	2346	A
<silence>	2346	B
uh right now i have um uh two longhair miniature dachshunds	2346	B
i also raise uh peacocks ducks i have three different kinds of ducks and i raise geese and rabbits	2346	B
but the uh uh the dogs and the peacocks are pets the rest of them we we do those for food	2346	B
yeah yeah we live out in the country	2346	B
so what do you have	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
uh-huh	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
yeah that's that's always nice when you have an animal that the kids can play with like that how old are the kids	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
huh you said your from DC	2346	B
I have	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
oh okay i have a	2346	B
my- my i have a daughter i think she's in Spring Field i'm not sure she's around there somewhere she just got her a new apartment	2346	B
and my other daughter and son-in-law live in Germantown	2346	B
so	2346	B
there	2346	B
yeah yeah so it's	2346	B
interesting to talk to somebody from that general vicinity	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
yeah	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
i wonder what he'd do if he ever got a hold of him though	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
oh oh	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
next time you'll have to try a bigger bird	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
	2346	B
we have some friends that in fact the ones that we bought one of the dogs from they also raise birds and they have uh	2346	B
two or three different kinds of of parrots and then they raise finches and parakeets and they show	2346	B
and he and he was showing me his parakeets and and he calls them an English parakeet and he said their marking is a little different	2346	B
have did did you know that there was a difference in the parakeets	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
yeah	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there	2346	B
that seems to be an up and coming business i know out there where we are there's there's uh a person on each side of our	2346	B
county that now have aviaries	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
one of them is right out there close to us they're in the process of building it up right now	2346	B
i know	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
uh-huh	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
yeah that's the problem with buying them through the pet shops we have that same problem here too	2346	B
yeah but we've used it we just have two rabbits right now we have one doe and one buck	2346	B
and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter we just got her	2346	B
the uh	2346	B
we go we had uh one doe that we'd had	2346	B
her	2346	B
let's see it was her second litter i guess the first litter she had she lost all but three	2346	B
uh babies and we raised those and then her second litter	2346	B
she wound up killing all of them_1	2346	B
and it took her like three days i guess before she killed all of them so we've we had to get rid of her	2346	B
so i i	2346	B
wouldn't tolerate that	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
yeah well this is the first time we've ever had one like that we had been down we had	2346	B
gone from having one buck and and three does down to one buck and just one doe	2346	B
but that didn't work out too well so now we're we're trying to build it back up	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
	2346	B
	2346	B
now that's a good idea	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
no that one would might get you in trouble	2346	B
yeah unless you called it Dog	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
we have been known to do that in the past we've we've got a couple of wild cats out there in our general vicinity	2346	B
and you know they're they're tame enough that they come up and want you to feed them but they're not tame enough that they want to stay around or come in or anything so	2346	B
you know those are just Big Cat and Little Cat	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
huh	2346	B
	2346	B
i bet it was that they do that you know they they have kittens out there in the garage or out in the barn	2346	B
and the first time you try to get around the kittens you know it's you'd have to catch them with a	2346	B
uh a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
	2346	B
did you in	2346	B
<silence>	2346	B
well it's been very nice talking to you i appreciate having the call	2346	B
and uh maybe we'll speak again on this little test that they're trying to do	2346	B
okay thank you bye-bye	2346	B
	2346	B
	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
so do you have any credit cards	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
um-hum	2301	A

um-hum	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
yeah um	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
i have uh the thing that that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh you mentioned the gasoline credit card	2301	A
i don't have that but i've got you know one of the the	2301	A
uh instant teller cards	2301	A
that you can use for point of sale purchases and we use that usually to buy gasoline and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
um-hum	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
yeah	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
yeah that's what they've they've talked about it of course it eliminates any waiting period and God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because_1 you won't be able to with that	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
no	2301	A
oh it was well they consider it to be the same as cash	2301	A
well because_1 it actually is yeah it's better than cash	2301	A
they don't even have to deposit it it just goes straight in there	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
right	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
um-hum	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
yeah but i'm so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them_1 up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them	2301	A
they paid them off and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them	2301	A
she said at least before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out i mean that's funny	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
yeah	2301	A
yeah i- i want to still have just one just in case but i'd sure want to get the get it paid down and not use it for a while	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
um-hum	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
yeah well our our limit is you know fairly low	2301	A
and uh so that's that's one thing that's good	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
oh i've got another call	2301	A
<silence>	2301	A
okay	2301	A
all right bye-bye	2301	A
	2301	A
	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
yes i do i keep uh i have an American Express and a Visa card that i keep you know kind of for emergency purposes and i have you know i use a gasoline credit card which i you know pay off every every month	2301	B
but i've i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have	2301	B
especially since you know it's no longer after this year or after tax year nineteen ninety there's there's no deductions for you know credit card interest that you pay so it's a	2301	B
you know gosh credit cards run what anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess	2301	B
it's just a bad deal course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
uh-huh that's that's probably enough	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
absolutely	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
yeah it's it's very easy to you know to do that or you know to abuse it it really is it's so easy to pull out the plastic	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
but we're trying our best not to not to add any you know credit card debt to our structure here	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
uh-huh	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
uh-huh	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
uh-huh	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
uh-huh	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
uh-huh	2301	B
uh-huh i'm sure you're right i don't i don't i don't participate in that but you know a lot of folks do	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
yeah at least with the uh gasoline company credit cards you have you know up to thirty twenty five thirty days you know interest free for it	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
yeah	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
it certainly does	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
absolutely	2301	B
that's right do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that	2301	B
i see	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
i see i see i	2301	B
it certainly is yeah	2301	B
uh-huh	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
that's right no returned checks or anything	2301	B
yeah	2301	B
no i i understand it's becoming you know the popular thing to do we're not participating in that particular program at the moment and i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
but uh i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards it's just you know too easy to do	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
that's right	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
	2301	B
well that's a novel idea yeah that would cause you think a little while wouldn't it	2301	B
that may not be a bad idea	2301	B
	2301	B
but i'm kind of	2301	B
getting a little more leery of credit cards you know as time goes by unless you just absolutely have to now there are times when you'd at least think you do anyway	2301	B
so we	2301	B
yeah	2301	B
yeah	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
yeah	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
that's right my wife and i really i guess are fortunate we're really not compulsive shoppers you know we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that	2301	B
but uh some people have a real problem with it	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
uh-huh	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
sure absolutely	2301	B
yeah	2301	B
<silence>	2301	B
oh i'm sorry	2301	B
it was nice talking to you	2301	B
take care	2301	B
bye bye	2301	B
	2301	B
um	2347	B
all right	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
oh well i tend i tend to agree uh in some ways i think it's uh i think if anything a lot of um	2347	B
the changes that have occurred um in some ways they're for the better because i think women should have a choice and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life but by the same token	2347	B
and i know this for myself because i've worked and i've not worked	2347	B
um that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that	2347	B
it it makes- it can make life more difficult there are more things to work out i know when i was working you know you have all these problems with	2347	B
with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that um	2347	B
that you need to do at home and and that doesn't change you know just because your your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't uh make those other things go away and the other responsibilities are still important um	2347	B
so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yes	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yes	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yes	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
 right	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
but yeah	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
oh i believe- i think so yes	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
 yeah	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the	2347	B
one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is i feel that in general in this society	2347	B
that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working	2347	B
and i was a an engineer so i was always with men	2347	B
uh and they were single many of them and i tried to explain to them well my day doesn't end when i leave at i used to leave at three i keep going to eleven at night and they had	2347	B
they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and i used to be infuriated because they really had no idea	2347	B
 what was involved once i got home now taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything	2347	B
um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel in uh compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected	2347	B
and that being home is not a respectable uh position in society and there's a lot of truth to that and i don't know how you feel i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got but i can see with the younger men	2347	B
that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like	2347	B
	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
um-hum	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
right	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
right	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
right right	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
that's true	2347	B
that's true	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yes	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
right	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
and they enjoy it	2347	B
yeah and they do enjoy it i i see you're right i see many more men in the supermarket in the parks with their children and i think that is healthy because children-	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
right oh yeah	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yes	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
and	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
oh boy	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
well it	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
well that that's true there is that part too and i guess we also have to examine though and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as you know anybody else um i guess having-	2347	B
oh oh yeah and and you have to i guess you have to question too why a lot of the men especially i think middle age and older men why they feel that way and	2347	B
and i think it gets scary for them to see change also they've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one and they come home and everything's done for them and their meal is served	2347	B
and i think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching and i think i think this reaction comes more out of fear now my husband is	2347	B
um he's ten years older than me and but he has his attitudes are	2347	B
very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything um and yet	2347	B
um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility	2347	B
um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever i'm kind of more <b_aside> thank you <e_aside> i'm kind of more middle	2347	B
of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time	2347	B
but i think it's um	2347	B
i don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because i think <b_aside> they're downstairs Aaron <e_aside> i think that's very um	2347	B
unfair to to children like uh engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week i refused to work more than thirty i was part-time and even that was a rat race but	2347	B
i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here i didn't want i don't want a job where i'm traveling around and and- i'm away and uh	2347	B
so i think you can have both it's more hectic but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need first then	2347	B
<silence>	2347	B
	2347	A
i've uh as far as i'm concerned i find that the young women have lost so much	2347	A
because they have become more aggressive and more dominating and i think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
i would like uh yes i have worked outside of the home and i was in one of those safe occupations i was a school teacher	2347	A
and we had one child when i taught for my two year career	2347	A
uh we uh then i stopped teaching after my husband's business- business was established and we had two children and i stayed home with those children and	2347	A
raised those children and now that my husband has retired i am back substitute teaching which	2347	A
if anyone has ever been involved in that some days it's fun and some days you wonder why you're even bothering because your fighting for your life but i am a fighter and i've always been a disciplinarian	2347	A
uh i'm i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply i think they're going in by choice	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
yes and and i have no problem with that but i think the male needs to be the dominant person	2347	A
and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand uh are not letting that happen they are very aggressive	2347	A
they're uh they almost have what i would call a killer -bee killer bee instinct	2347	A
and they have to be in charge and and i think- i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
oh sure	2347	A
	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
hum	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
if my wife had an education and could support us and the only value i see coming out of this is that children now in in a two parent home they now actually have two parents because	2347	A
i see my sons-in-law i have a daughter who's a nurse and i have a daughter who's a beautician and i see my sons-in-law cooking	2347	A
and dropping children off at the sitter and picking children up from school and	2347	A
and having a much better relationship with their children than my husband ever did because he left home at five thirty in the morning and he got home at six fifteen	2347	A
and uh he ate his dinner and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted	2347	A
so now the young fathers are having a chance to parent and i think that's an advantage	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
and i think it's a a wonderful advantage for the young for the for the particularly for the males for the little boys to have a relationship with their father and and i don't think you	2347	A
we get into so much of the mother dominating figure if if the father has more input there	2347	A
but uh i don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads and they have to that kind of job uh to go out there and shovel that tar and	2347	A
and drive those big trucks and we just recently finished a long drive through the west a little over five thousand miles and at one point we sat down	2347	A
uh i didn't realize it but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only and here's this young girl	2347	A
with the tattoos and she was- has just had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona and she'd been	2347	A
and i ask her how old she was and she was the age- between the age of our daughters	2347	A
and she had been driving a truck for seven years and i thought gosh	2347	A
i mean why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life style when	2347	A
i guess i'm still- i'm a maybe Victorian and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist in that	2347	A
he's a very considerate person but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home and she should vote but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote	2347	A
now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because i have strong opinions about things too but	2347	A
uh i like being taken care of i like my luggage carried and my door opened and i think the young women are losing that and i think that's sad	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
he was raised in the south i think that's a little war condition both	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
sure	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh uh-huh huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
<silence>	2347	A
i think a lot of my problem with the young mothers is-	2347	A
	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
okay Jay um	2378	A
could you tell me uh what your thoughts are about crime	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
oh so that's	2378	A
what do you do work in Plano	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
how how far away is that from Dallas from the city itself	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
oh so it	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah that's uh that's the same with me well um	2378	A
i grew up in a rural area there's nothing but farms	2378	A
and i still live in the same area it's it's built up somewhat and crime	2378	A
really hasn't been a problem it's been uh	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh	2378	A
radios and cassettes and things like that	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
	2378	A
not so much in in the town i live in now but but the closest large city in Rhode Island is Providence and then it's Boston which is about uh	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
oh forty five fifty miles away	2378	A
which is really not that far	2378	A
and Providence is only like a dozen miles from from where i am	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
 but the cities down there yeah and and	2378	A
and the next one up is uh is a small city between me and Providence	2378	A
and that they're stealing handbags now in broad daylight they're taking the the crime now the latest thing up here is	2378	A
uh they'll somebody be driving along whether they're they're in their early twenty's or or teens	2378	A
and they'll steal jackets they'll holdup kids and they'll take their jackets and chains you know just get out of the car and	2378	A
because they have got some of these like the leather jackets are are quite expensive	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
they just that's that's incredible	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah that's	2378	A
yeah for a pair of tennis shoes	2378	A
yeah yeah no shoe is worth that that price uh	2378	A
you know not to not to go out and scuff up and	2378	A
but	2378	A
i don't know what the it's	2378	A
	2378	A
it's probably the uh the times now um	2378	A
i know you guys down there have had have had a problem for a while which we're experiencing now with the savings and loans and	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah and rents are are extremely high i mean people and they just don't care	2378	A
you know it's either it's either you go out and you and you steal something or you you bash somebody over the head	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
or you starve	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
we had we had uh an incident in our town not too far from where i live where uh	2378	A
the police made a raid on and- and most of them were teenagers or or	2378	A
in their early twenties	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
which is unheard of in a small town	2378	A
you know you don't usually associate associate that	2378	A
but they did they made the raid you know and the whole town was upset	2378	A
but i'm not so sure now if if uh if the drugs are really prevalent they're saying that alcohol now is is uh one of the major contributors	2378	A
like all of all the students now on campus uh i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
and going to school	2378	A
is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy	2378	A
you know you either have to take a loan or most of them don't work or if they work they work part-time for	2378	A
minimum wage yeah	2378	A
yeah i'm not sure down there if you guys are all picking up but up here it's it's terrible	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
so you're still suffering then	2378	A
as far as that goes	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah i was down	2378	A
i was in Dallas about uh twelve thirteen years ago and then i just went down again last month for a week	2378	A
and it was it's like one huge city when i was flying in	2378	A
it was just all lights	2378	A
but you couldn't tell there was a problem	2378	A
you know because it's so huge	2378	A
part- part of the problem too i think up here is i mean um	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
all the banking crisis all the white collar crimes uh stock brokers have been getting away with bloody murder the bankers have been getting away with bloody murder	2378	A
nobody's being prosecuted	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
so	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
right what's	2378	A
yeah what's the what's the poor guy going to do that's that's you know being threatened or thrown out on the street and he's got a family to support and he's got no job	2378	A
um	2378	A
i'm not sure how much of that is is crime rather than just kids out there for a good time yeah	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah because there's more and more there's more murders we had uh	2378	A
just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had five murders	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah i mean Rhode- Rhode Island's just like a neighborhood compared to you guys down there it's just so so so small	2378	A
and nobody even cares or nobody seems to care	2378	A
yeah yeah	2378	A
yeah and if it's if it's drug related they turn the other way because that's one less problem that they have to put up with the law enforcement	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
and uh if they do come in i've got some friends on the police force and they say that you know they apprehend somebody and they bring them in and uh and they let them out they're out on the street before they get their reports done	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
so there's no checks and balances	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
and i'm not sure what what to do about that or which way it's going to go	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean	2378	A
the fire power against them now is is atrocious	2378	A
you know they've got	2378	A
all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do	2378	A
and these poor guys out there uh trying to uphold the law	2378	A
um	2378	A
i don't know i kind of think they should bring back capital punishment	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
well	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
it's yeah yeah	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah for twenty or thirty years or forever there's no	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah um	2378	A
and when i say there's no deterrent you know of the death penalty	2378	A
um that's like saying that	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
you don't put up any stoplights anymore because it's not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads	2378	A
so it- it just doesn't hold water and you look at some of the other countries that that have the death penalty	2378	A
and they don't have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the violent crime rates that we do	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
	2378	A
yeah- i- yeah i wouldn't want to see it go that far	2378	A
you know give them due process and then and then let them	2378	A
and then let them appeal yeah then you'd get yeah because some of it some of it's it's it's just down right	2378	A
uh mean i mean they go out there just just for the sake of of harming somebody	2378	A
and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
um	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
yeah he can	2378	A
	2378	A
because it's eventually it's going to it's going to swing back	2378	A
<silence>	2378	A
it was	2378	A
they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybody's swore you know we're no better than they are if we if we put the death penalty in and	2378	A
	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
i tell you what here in Dallas it's uh it's awful bad because that they're i i believe there's starting to be a lot more violent type crimes	2378	B
uh where you see armed robbery and and uh rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area	2378	B
and uh that's that's getting that's getting scary because i grew up in a real small town and i moved here to Dallas and uh it's been a rude awakening i tell you	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
uh right right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
well see it's it it's really just a suburb uh i really can't even tell where Plano starts and Dallas Dallas ends	2378	B
but uh i grew up in a real small town in north Texas and uh moved down here to Plano an and uh	2378	B
it's uh it's definitely a big change	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
i see	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
not really the violent crimes then	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
i see	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
i see	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
okay so that's real close	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
oh Lord	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
you know i've heard about that uh also for tennis shoes	2378	B
there was uh uh a big surge going on oh just last year i think where uh kids like in New York uh were uh knocking off other kids to get their tennis shoes	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know they're getting up in the hundred dollar range	2378	B
and that just seems ridiculous	2378	B
for a pair of tennis shoes yeah	2378	B
so	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
that's right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
i don't know what the answer is though to to try to fix that problem	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
exactly yeah just economic- overall economic uh times around here in Texas have been tough	2378	B
yeah	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
to get it yeah	2378	B
well another- another problem i think is the the drugs	2378	B
you know uh people have to get money for the the drugs and	2378	B
and they'll just go out and do anything they can to do it	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
exactly	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
yeah it's hard to get a job you know	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
you know we really haven't uh because the oil industry just hasn't come back like it was	2378	B
and so much of our economy was based on that	2378	B
so	2378	B
yeah yeah	2378	B
right that that and real estate you know just have not come back uh even close to what they were	2378	B
and um yeah Dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but uh and i don't think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
i see	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
right	2378	B
and	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
that's right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
what's going to stop them_1 from you know other people to	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
well that's true too yeah yeah	2378	B
but you know the violent crime is is uh definitely something's got to be done on that	2378	B
because_1	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
golly that's ridiculous	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
 right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
they just overlook that as uh common occurrence	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
oh that's	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
golly that's terrible isn't it	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
well see i'm not either because i'm i'm really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street	2378	B
as far as the officers and things like that but uh	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
i think yeah that's true	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
and uh	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
so i don't know	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
well i do too and you know i know people argue that that's really not a deterrent and people don't think about that but i've i've got to believe that	2378	B
in the back of their mind if they know they're going to go out and kill somebody and that you know they're going to get the death penalty then and that it will actually happen	2378	B
you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison uh	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know that's just	2378	B
i just don't understand that	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
but	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right that's true yeah	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
and then do it huh	2378	B
that's right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
exactly	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
exactly and and	2378	B
you know i don't even know if they are worth rehabilitating if if uh they go out and commit some of these violent crimes	2378	B
so but i don't know what the answer is we'll just have to i guess each each person will just have to try to do their part and	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
right	2378	B
<silence>	2378	B
	2389	A
okay	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
oh i think i think that the um woman's role has come a long way we've gone more into the business aspect of uh	2389	A
like i say of i don't know working more and then and we i think we've even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also	2389	A
uh with the pay and everything you know	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
 oh and a lot of times you can't yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah my mom um she's a housewife and well there's twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because_1 she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work	2389	A
uh she worked before she got married but um she um she doesn't believe in she's very old fashioned she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah uh-huh	2389	A
yeah um and also like my mom my mom thinks and i mean she she's kind of right with it when both	2389	A
um partners of of the marriage work she feels that that's taking more away from- that's that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work	2389	A
you know like for for the men that don't have jobs if you know she feels that if those women weren't out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and with- yeah	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
well what- what do you think about that do you think that um	2389	A
what- do- what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
i	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
or they won't be as good as they could be	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
exactly	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
oh my	2389	A
 Bless you	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah i i agree	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
and they just enjoyed the income the extra	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
exactly	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
oh i know	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
exactly	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
see yeah see now um my parents there's no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college and um	2389	A
so far there's only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and i'm on my i have six weeks left for- and i'll you know i'll graduate and i paid my entire way and that's the way it'll go down the line and	2389	A
like we- i don't have a car because i'm paying for college if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think that's right because	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum like i've had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their money's just given to them_1 like they still get their allowance they're twenty years old and they still get an allowance	2389	A
well i've held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade	2389	A
and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don't even know what- i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor	2389	A
you know	2389	A
 well if they do they don't know of it you know	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
oh i know	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many	2389	A
because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think	2389	A
i i really- i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it	2389	A
i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion	2389	A
i think it'll be freedom of choice	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
exactly- yeah	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i definitely- i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
i i do i'm Catholic and i we we're not supposed to you know say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice	2389	A
i do	2389	A
<silence>	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
and and different circumstances call for different things	2389	A
	2389	A
	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
if you want to go first go ahead	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yes definitely	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
well i feel that uh i we've missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon	2389	B
because_1 if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman	2389	B
you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that	2389	B
in one sense um i'm- i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today	2389	B
you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore	2389	B
it's- most of the time- you know even- even if you want to say home you can't- you really can't	2389	B
it's- it's- it's-	2389	B
you- you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff	2389	B
uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know	2389	B
so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we have- we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
oh God love her	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then you- you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great	2389	B
but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility	2389	B
and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know	2389	B
uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that's why there's so many problems you know with kids today because_1 they don't have the family roots anymore	2389	B
you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be	2389	B
you know in that sense	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
oh definitely	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
that's right	2389	B
they don't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that's very true but then they shouldn't have a family	2389	B
that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today	2389	B
that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there's no need to have children if you don't want them	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent	2389	B
uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh	2389	B
right that's- that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job	2389	B
it's- it's not like something that they really wanted	2389	B
like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them	2389	B
i'm not sorry i had any of them_1 and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them	2389	B
you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible	2389	B
in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn't belong anymore	2389	B
and it was because i had worked for about nine months	2389	B
and when they were coming home i was going to work	2389	B
and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out	2389	B
so we were i i felt i was losing my family	2389	B
and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift	2389	B
and i worked that shift for eleven years	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home	2389	B
you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad because- because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that uh we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there	2389	B
and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because_1 the men weren't here anymore	2389	B
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries	2389	B
and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes	2389	B
and we had to walk before we had a car	2389	B
and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car	2389	B
and uh it to me it's like we've lost our values in this country	2389	B
we really have and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but	2389	B
i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me	2389	B
you'll take better care of that and you'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you	2389	B
and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
of course	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
sure	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
but i'll bet your values are a lot higher	2389	B
you know your- your- and your self esteem and the way- the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense	2389	B
than these kids that don't have that responsibility	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
you that that	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
sure yeah	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
sure they probably don't even have any	2389	B
or yeah exactly	2389	B
and that's what i say you'll- you'll be- you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there	2389	B
and no one can tell anyone anything anything- you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen	2389	B
you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know	2389	B
 just attention you know	2389	B
but really uh what- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing	2389	B
women in politics and	2389	B
president someday maybe	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yeah yeah	2389	B
well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear	2389	B
then i mean all- all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know	2389	B
but uh	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yes yes	2389	B
which i mean i think it should be anyway	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
no	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
yeah because_1 i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business	2389	B
and uh	2389	B
<silence>	2389	B
exactly exactly that's	2389	B
	2323	B
all righty so uh do you think Russia's still a threat	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
 there you go	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
well i think have- have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four	2323	B
okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other	2323	B
right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US during- during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them	2323	B
because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country	2323	B
and you didn't want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right	2323	B
and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are	2323	B
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself	2323	B
like i was telling people i'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lithuania- in Lithuania	2323	B
they they were announced to be a separate country	2323	B
but yet the the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn't go in there and try to save those people	2323	B
you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country why because you're going into the border	2323	B
right once you get into the border then there's a threat but what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you but let's mess with the neutral countries	2323	B
you know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people	2323	B
you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there	2323	B
but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere	2323	B
and the US has	2323	B
you know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering	2323	B
you know but i think i think the thing is is that	2323	B
there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button	2323	B
but not the USSR the USSR wouldn't do it	2323	B
because they got too much at stake	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
yeah	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
well	2323	B
my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used	2323	B
that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he's got one less thing to go against him	2323	B
i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know	2323	B
but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you like Marcos right	2323	B
we'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
 uh no	2323	B
no	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
yeah	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
right	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
right	2323	B
and uh you know there's there's just	2323	B
you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i don't believe in war that's my thing i don't believe that anybody should die	2323	B
you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i'm i go to war and i'm holding a gun and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know	2323	B
but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that's ridiculous	2323	B
you know i mean i just don't believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but	2323	B
it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that you know	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
yeah	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so	2323	B
and keep his power but well	2323	B
<silence>	2323	B
no i i don't think so i think uh and they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia	2323	B
would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that	2323	B
they said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete	2323	B
so it must be a beautiful country it's just that you know	2323	B
they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do	2323	B
so oh well i got to go to class now	2323	B
nice talking to you bye-bye	2323	B
	2323	B
	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
well i guess i'm maybe naive but i never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us i mean obviously there's the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war	2323	A
uh but i somehow think that war is one of those things that that maybe is inevitable but uh	2323	A
i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
yes	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
yeah	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
but i guess there was concern uh that Iraq- Iraq would use	2323	A
you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn't happen i mean why not	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right i don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet	2323	A
 i think that's that's that's not very likely	2323	A
but yet you know as as the parallel with Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people and i guess that makes sense what you said that	2323	A
uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary	2323	A
yeah	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
well or that at that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldn't resolve	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the US	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
uh-huh	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
right right	2323	A
<silence>	2323	A
okay well thanks bye-bye	2323	A
	2323	A
	2328	B
do you have children	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
okay	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
	2328	B
	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh i'm kind of at the other extreme i have a nine month old and one that will be born in October	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
oh really	2328	B
yeah that's when my nephew's birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so we'll see	2328	B
	2328	B
yeah at it's that close	2328	B
yeah	2328	B
i he definitely i had an unusual situation with- in my home my father was was alcoholic but uh and very withdrawn at that and so my husband is ten times more involved and we have more of a	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh i guess a Christian based home and so we try to make the family as important as we can	2328	B
and uh	2328	B
	2328	B
he helps a lot with her he helps feeding her changing her and playing with her and	2328	B
and i think he has to be conscious of of uh needing to spend time with her if not then he gets wrapped up in the TV and the newspaper and whatever else and he says oh i didn't spend time with Emily	2328	B
	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
i think so	2328	B
	2328	B
i think uh i've been reading a lot lately about the alcohol children of alcoholics syndrome i don't know if you've heard of that or not	2328	B
but uh trying to relate that to me and i think because i had a strong Christian background personally it affected me differently than it affected my sisters and i see myself uh with some of those qualities but with not quite as much anger	2328	B
as i see them towards him or towards my mother with certain things and uh	2328	B
as far as me personally i think	2328	B
it made me appreciate my husband more because he doesn't do certain things that my dad did so i	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh i think that's that's how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily	2328	B
because i don't want to my mother was also a domineering type of personality because she had to take over the things that my dad fell short in	2328	B
and i find you know i think okay i want Emily to be this way and this is what i'm going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you can't do that	2328	B
she has to develop her own personality and so sometimes i i have to step back and say okay we want to encourage her we want to influence her but we don't want to control her	2328	B
and so far it hasn't been too hard but she hasn't been making a whole lot of decisions on her own yet and so you know i guess i'm i'm just going to have to be real conscious of that as i as she gets older and does start making decisions	2328	B
and be conscious that i need to give her options but not make the decisions for her	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
um i i look at myself and i have three sisters there's four daughters in the family i look at myself compared to my sisters' families	2328	B
and see that one of them married an abusive husband one of them married an alcoholic uh the other one married into a pretty stable relationship	2328	B
and mine is pretty stable or much more stable i think probably than any of them but now i waited until i was thirty to get married and they all married at eighteen but uh	2328	B
	2328	B
um	2328	B
well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like	2328	B
if he had any opinions to give he would tell my mother and she would tell us and so we had almost no direct relationship with him i mean he was there and and we you know did little things together as a family but on the whole there was no	2328	B
no direct communication no show of affection no even no show of anger unless it he was you know really really drunk	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
oh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh yeah i see my father relating much better to the grandchildren than he did to us	2328	B
	2328	B
not completely no he he still has a problem with it and he goes in stages	2328	B
but he still you know he will pick up my one of my granddaughters and say you know give her a hug and say i love you and the first time he said i love you to me was when i had been away from home for almost a year and a half	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
yeah it i said i love you dad i miss you and then he said was able to say it back and and i was twenty four and that's the first time i'd heard him say anything you know similar to that	2328	B
	2328	B
um	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
yeah	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
they went through that entire process yeah	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh i think too that with us as women being out of the home where i'm not working now i didn't work until about from about the time Emily about four months before she was born	2328	B
and but so many women are having children and returning to the work field that the the dads	2328	B
you know have to to follow through or a third person has to come in and follow through with with the the care and the dads are are doing more	2328	B
and that bond is starting you know like you said right at the beginning and then developing it's not breaking at any point	2328	B
at least it shouldn't and and and and in a good family it isn't unfortunately there's so many families where there isn't a father in the home it's just yeah that's right yeah	2328	B
 yeah so	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
yeah	2328	B
yeah they see you go through the problems and still come out okay working together	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
uh-huh	2328	B
<silence>	2328	B
yes yeah well that sounds good my background is in sociology and so i see a lot of unwed mothers	2328	B
	2328	A
	2328	A
my children are thirty three twenty nine and twenty five	2328	A
and i uh am spending more time with my twenty five year old because at this point he happens to be single and always has been single and living at home uh while he's trying to uh	2328	A
	2328	A
the only thing i can say about the raising of these little things is that my sons-in-law seem to be so much more involved than my husband ever was or the husbands of our age group	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
oh how wonderful we had uh an October baby on the fifteenth May	2328	A
	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
yeah well my husband's is on the fourteenth so we did miss that one day by a few hours there but we didn't care at that point so	2328	A
so do you find your husband more involved than your father was with you	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
um	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
Christianity doesn't hurt us any does it	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
um-hum	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh and perhaps Emily will when she's a little older	2328	A
uh-huh uh how do you find uh with an alcoholic father how do you find- how- what effect do you think that has on your life as an adult	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
the reason i'm asking is because i have a dear dear friend whose father was alcoholic	2328	A
and at fifty she and she was an only child	2328	A
at fifty she's still- still having a lot of difficulty in her relationship with her husband that she feels stems from how she was treated by her father	2328	A
and how she feels that she has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from the fact that her father was alcoholic over which of course she had no control	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh and you don't feel that your relationship with your father has unduly uh influenced your relationship with your husband then	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
um	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh	2328	A
	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2328	A
you didn't need to get away from home then	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
my father- my husband was like that but that was because he was working all the time establishing a business and running it certainly he i mean he got off work and he came home	2328	A
and he ate dinner and his work was outside and in the winter time by the time he was warm he was asleep so it wasn't that he was	2328	A
neglectful of his children by choice there just was no time and energy left for them by the time he put in his workday which started like at five thirty and ended at six thirty uh	2328	A
 you know alcoholism wasn't a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he seemed to be the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted them	2328	A
he just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now uh he's very excited- he's retired and he's spending time with his grandchildren which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
so he has overcome alcoholism at this point	2328	A
oh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
um-hum	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
oh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
but he said it	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
yeah	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
the first time i heard my older daughter tell and she is our most expressive tell my husband that she loved him he said well i certainly hope so	2328	A
so he but then he came from a background where he is so much more open with his children than his father was with him	2328	A
his father was just a very quiet withdrawn person and i assume very shy as is my husband	2328	A
uh he shows his feelings but he cannot express it and i think that's kind of sad in a way i see other fathers put their arms around their daughters or their sons and	2328	A
we have two daughters and a son and uh he just can't do that and i i know that he would if he could and i i kind of feel sorry for him because i think he misses a lot and	2328	A
as i say our our sons-in-law are so open and caring and giving to their children and i wonder if it's because they're there when they delivered- they're delivered if that	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
right if that maybe starts in the delivery room with a chain that my generation missed out on	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
uh-huh or a mother some of them the fathers are raising the children	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
it's certainly not a good situation but i'm sure it's not one that the the the families chose i mean i'm sure they felt they had no choice at our stage in life we've seen	2328	A
a lot of our friends go through divorces uh you know we've been married thirty five years and so that's how old our friends are	2328	A
and they're on their second marriage and they've got his kids and her kids and i think my gosh all the pain they've caused themselves and their children i just	2328	A
you know of course everything wasn't always rosy for us but you know- we stayed together and at this point our children are saying gosh i'm glad you did that	2328	A
so i think it makes for a more solid basis for them or i hope so at least	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
um-hum and they see that with my husband's retirement a little over a year ago we're having a wonderful time and i think they look at that and and uh and that way i think we're doing a lot for our grandchildren	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
um-hum	2328	A
<silence>	2328	A
	2328	A
	2381	A
so what kind of camping do you like	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
so you like that more civilized kind of camping you got cots	2381	A
yeah well i'm i'm sort of a rough-and-ready camper i'll uh	2381	A
whatever i can carry on a backpack it was	2381	A
is is what i go with	2381	A
um when i was in the Air Force i used to be up in South Dakota	2381	A
and there were some really nice places up in the Black Hills to go camping	2381	A
and i had this really nice place you had to uh drive in as far as i could and then park and then you had to walk in the rest of the way	2381	A
but it was across a little stream and it was sort of um	2381	A
uh not a big area but there was a perfectly round stand of trees	2381	A
and it had a nice little area inside that course it gave you shelter and everything	2381	A
and it was right next to a nice cold stream	2381	A
so it was my favorite place	2381	A
and probably the worse thing that ever happened was around March the weather starts getting funny it will be warm one day and freezing the next	2381	A
so but that's also about the time you start getting cabin fever	2381	A
well i had cabin fever really bad so i loaded up the car and took off	2381	A
and i got up there and got camped or got got my camp setup	2381	A
and that night it got down to seventeen below and started snowing	2381	A
yeah	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
oh i had i had a nice sleeping bag i also had uh uh catalytic heater	2381	A
um but i woke up and the snow was halfway up the the front of the tent	2381	A
i'm going oh no	2381	A
i go out i had all my stuff set- i had my little campfire thing setup and my	2381	A
pots and pans and stove and all that	2381	A
and i get everything's buried under snow so i'm out there digging around so i think well to hell with it you know i'll go i'll go play around for a while	2381	A
well there's this fallen tree across the stream and these streams of course are felt fed by melted snow so they're cold anyway	2381	A
so here i am going across this snow encrusted log	2381	A
and i slipped and fell in	2381	A
and crashed through the ice right up to my neck in freezing cold weather i could just feel my heart going	2381	A
uh	2381	A
well fortunately i had the presence of mind when i slipped i just i just went with it i didn't try to twist or anything	2381	A
and as i went i just turned and stuck my arms out and i hit the hit the log with my arms	2381	A
and that pretty much saved me from going all the way under	2381	A
um anyway i finally pulled myself out and i mean just as soon as i got out my clothes started freezing	2381	A
yeah so i i	2381	A
trotted back to the car rather quickly	2381	A
uh jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back	2381	A
it was	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
i think i almost did that was something	2381	A
yeah i i enjoy camping i like getting out	2381	A
especially i don't i don't understand these people- people take these camper trailers and stuff i mean that's that's not camping i mean that's like	2381	A
yeah i mean here you are you got you know you got showers and stoves and refrigerators and TV's and air conditioning	2381	A
i mean good grief that's not camping	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
i like to rough it	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
no usually i went by myself it was sort of get away from everybody time	2381	A
and you've been locked up with folks all winter it's time to get away by yourself	2381	A
and it was so it was so nice up there that just	2381	A
i mean it was so	2381	A
quiet and peaceful	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah it's nice nice area	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah she fooled you	2381	A
uh i've got three kitty cats and they were suppose to be taking a nap and	2381	A
one just crawled up in my lap and every time she hears me on the phone she's got to come sit in my lap	2381	A
got to be got to be part of the action here	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
oh	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah all my all mine are uh purebreds so i keep them in	2381	A
yeah especially	2381	A
especially	2381	A
especially this one	2381	A
she's a mess	2381	A
<b_aside> aren't you kitty cat <e_aside>	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
sort of like TI exclusive	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah	2381	A
have you had many calls	2381	A
	2381	A
well i tell you it's it's it's easy to do it's just uh like when i started calling you it was two twenty my time one twenty your time i guess	2381	A
and however long it took however long we've been on that's how long it took for some for the computer to find somebody	2381	A
yeah i've been sitting here and sitting here and sitting here	2381	A
yeah	2381	A
i didn't think it would take as long as it does but like last night when i made one	2381	A
the long- that was the longest one i waited thirty five minutes	2381	A
and sometimes you'll get it on the first try i mean it's just	2381	A
yeah this is not a real good time of day because most people listed their home numbers and of course they're gone	2381	A
but i've got a class tonight so i wanted to get these out of the way	2381	A
this is this is my thirtieth call	2381	A
yeah	2381	A
yeah	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
uh-huh	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
	2381	A
yeah the only reason i'd do it is because i want to make sure that i get all my calls in before they they just up and pull the plug on the program you know	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah because being a student i'm doing it for the money	2381	A
and uh i wanna	2381	A
i want to make sure i'm i'm my roommate does it too	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah	2381	A
it'll be a nice little bit of money we're going to	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
well of course there's this other one that i've i've talked to fairly regularly in Dallas um same thing her husband signed up for it and she's the one that does it	2381	A
 but he'll spend the money i bet	2381	A
yeah we're going to take the money and get uh go out and find a nice stud for Himy Persian	2381	A
yeah she's a she's a beauty we're going to going to get a nice litter off of her	2381	A
yeah she's she's so sweet too	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
uh-huh	2381	A
yeah that's that's bit a problem- i mean you could always buy a uh you could always buy a Sphinx	2381	A
those are hairless cats of course they're	2381	A
oh they are they're they're loads of fun that's the most playful cat around	2381	A
but they on the other hand too they cost twenty five hundred dollars	2381	A
	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah my my roomy wants to buy a a Sphinx	2381	A
and i keep saying no no no	2381	A
no	2381	A
we both decided on a Devonrex though it's sort of like a Sphinx it's a very short haired cat	2381	A
it's almost like just fuzz	2381	A
but uh they're substantially cheaper	2381	A
we're we're into this breeding business pretty heavy now and he	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
yeah as long as you don't lose sight that they're still kitty cats	2381	A
and they're fun to have around	2381	A
this one here is just sweet	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
she's kneading on my my stomach pushing and pushing and drooling	2381	A
<b_aside> quit drooling on me look at this i'm wet <e_aside>	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
oh	2381	A
<silence>	2381	A
that's it all right it was good talking to you	2381	A
talk to you later Janet bye-bye	2381	A
	2381	A
<silence>	2381	B
well we uh as a little girl i used to go camping with my family and uh we'd load up our car and take tents and cots and all kinds of stuff and	2381	B
the place that we went the most often was uh in Oklahoma it's about a two or three hour drive and it is a little bitty national park right in the right in a town called Sulphur Oklahoma	2381	B
and it was real pretty had lots of trees and creeks to play in and it was a lot of fun	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
 yeah probably so	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh	2381	B

<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B

<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah oh yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh no	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh no	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh no	2381	B
how did you get out of that	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
oh man	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh that's awful	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh my goodness oh that's quite an experience i probably would have had a heart attack and died right there on the spot	2381	B
 oh that	2381	B
i bet	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah that's just like moving to another area for a while	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
i know it's kind of funny	2381	B
yeah well did you go camping by yourself then you didn't go with other people or	2381	B
huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah well that's nice	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah just a second	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
uh when i uh planned my little uh schedule of when i could talk on the phone this one was suppose to be asleep	2381	B
and she's not cooperating	2381	B
yeah i think so	2381	B
oh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah wants you to	2381	B
 my kids want a cat so bad and uh i'd i'd like to get them one but we live close to a busy street and almost everyone has a cat it's been hit run over maimed you know and i just can't stand the thought of it	2381	B
so	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah keep them in the house	2381	B
well that may be our only option if we ever get one	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
huh	2381	B
huh	2381	B
well	2381	B
this is real interesting that you're as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we're	2381	B
yeah TI people yeah and so i just figured no it's just this area you know	2381	B
well that's interesting	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
well you're my third one and i have never gotten the courage to do it myself isn't that funny	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
for it to	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh my	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh i never thought about that that it would take a long time to find someone available	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
uh-huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh my goodness	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah i guess it depends on the time of day too	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh wow	2381	B
that's great well i got a catalog that you know shows all the gifts and things you can get and	2381	B
i started getting inspired thinking oh we need to do this i'd like to have a few of those things	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
that's right and they probably will soon so	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah yeah i can see that	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
huh well that's pretty neat	2381	B
well	2381	B
yeah yeah every time i've talked to one of them my husband said i can't believe that you made five dollars every time you do that it sounds easy so he signed up to do it but he's never done one so	2381	B
 i know	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah i know it's crazy	2381	B
that's right yeah he'll say yeah i did that	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
well that will be neat	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh i tell you my kids would love to they'd just want any kind of a cat bless their hearts	2381	B
and like i said um i really would like to have one too because i know how much they want one It's just hard one my youngest daughter has asthma and uh been a little afraid to have a cat in the house all the time with a child that has asthma	2381	B
so i thought well i need an outdoor cat but if i have an outdoor cat i'm afraid it's going to get hurt so	2381	B
i have a problem	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
huh huh i don't think they'd be too fun	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
are they	2381	B
huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh my land i'd be scared to death to have anything that expensive	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
huh	2381	B
oh i've never heard of that	2381	B
yeah	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
huh	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah i would hope so	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
well that's good	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah yeah	2381	B
yeah i guess so	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
oh that's neat	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
	2381	B
well it was nice talking to you i think i'm going to have to catch my daughter before she eats any more candy when i'm on the phone that's her sign that she can do what she wants to do	2381	B
<silence>	2381	B
yeah you too	2381	B
okay thanks good-bye	2381	B
	2381	B
<silence>	2361	B
that's true	2361	B
and you get sequestered or something then you're there for months	2361	B
	2361	B
when- when you get sequestered and you're there for months	2361	B
true	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
yeah right	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
well as as you say the the um	2361	B
benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that	2361	B
it is a boom- a a a plus to have that even- as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it	2361	B
because_1 it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good insurance- uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRA's	2361	B
uh the profit sharing the stock options	2361	B
there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is	2361	B
and um	2361	B
i think that uh a a lot of it's the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job	2361	B
uh the incentive you know to want to do a good job	2361	B
and the um	2361	B
MIR awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people	2361	B
and they're uh meetings	2361	B
to keep you full informed	2361	B
you don't find that much in small companies because_1 you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's going on	2361	B
that type of thing um	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
uh	2361	B
we interface kind of like uh on the tip teams and things i think that's a good deal	2361	B
it gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the organization and that you're heard	2361	B
and know and if you have ideas that type of thing	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
oh i use it up	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
do you have a mandatory	2361	B
uh do you have a mandatory shut down	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
oh that's why see see you can you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice	2361	B
that's the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to	2361	B
but we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know	2361	B
and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that they're supplying	2361	B
but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at Texas Instruments	2361	B
and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know you're not in the same area	2361	B
so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time	2361	B
so that isn't too nice	2361	B
uh this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time	2361	B
to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people	2361	B
so that's quite a feat in itself	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
uh-huh	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
uh-huh	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
oh that's great	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
yeah really that's excellent	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
yeah yeah	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
well they're doing a lot with um automation specialist also that's what i do	2361	B
uh where you have to go to school to or run the new automated- automated equipment it's all computerized and and stuff	2361	B
and uh there's a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to uh come up to an experience level where you're able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance uh	2361	B
diagnose what's wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things	2361	B
and interface with the technicians in the toolroom	2361	B
so you're kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes	2361	B
and um it's about a two year to three year experience before you're able to really um i would say payback	2361	B
you know and and do the job well	2361	B
and you're still learning even after all that time because_1 they're very complex machines	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
exactly that's right	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school	2361	B
that's another good uh benefit that TI has and they'll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them	2361	B
you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years	2361	B
or uh you know to that affect	2361	B
and you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you can't if you're you know signed in a contract	2361	B
whereas at TI they don't do that	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
oh	2361	B
oh	2361	B
oh	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
well this part of the country there's no shortage- shortage of uh good schools	2361	B
you know like MIT and and uh Boston's only uh an hours drive from here	2361	B
so a lot of the the people can go you know to uh a good school	2361	B
and right in Rhode Island there are some nice colleges too Rhode Island college and	2361	B
<silence>	2361	B
well a large organization offers uh	2361	A
usually a good vacation time and they offer uh holidays and and	2361	A
medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff uh personal leave or whatever you need	2361	A
and one thing that i've found coming in handy lately is juror duty uh being paid for that or or at least a full days pay plus whatever the the local government pays you	2361	A
it's nice to be able to do that and not have to concern yourself with your job as it were especially if you get on a case	2361	A
so uh	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right that would be uh a	2361	A
	2361	A
uh flex times another benefit that i- i like that TI's been doing uh though officially they just started it uh	2361	A
uh relatively recently uh we were always given the privilege with our	2361	A
supervisor that was there we were really small shop and there was only one shift so we didn't interfere with anyone and	2361	A
he liked the idea of having someone there early enough to handle third shift's concerns and late enough to handle second shift and so he allowed us to come in basically as we as we wanted to and as it worked out two or three of us were there about six in the morning and	2361	A
and later on well eight to nine o'clock some other ones would show up and that puts people there at the five o'clock time frame and it really worked out well and then then of course they came long and sanctioned it and	2361	A
and actually made it a little worse in that they said they didn't want any of us starting before six thirty so	2361	A
	2361	A
they have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in but uh	2361	A
it's it's nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and uh not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours that's that's a real benefit	2361	A
what have you found that you like in a big organization	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
do you	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum do you find that your vacation time do you manage to use it up or do you end up into the must use okay	2361	A
there's a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact uh just	2361	A
tend not to get around to taking it all at once and uh by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and	2361	A
and uh i'm still doing uh my wife works uh half of a half of one day one day a week so on Thursdays	2361	A
excuse me	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
no we don't have uh we do have mass vacation but in our group it doesn't apply we're so busy year round yeah	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right too	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
take it when you want to yeah	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
oh boy	2361	A
	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
yeah	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
yeah it is	2361	A
we've got um if i take half a day off during the summertime when the kids are out of school i can manage to be home in time to uh take care of the kids before the wife leaves she works	2361	A
uh oh i starts about eleven or twelve o'clock uh at the dentist office and works until seven thirty or eight that's just one late night to it to clean teeth as it were and	2361	A
he had a hard time finding someone that was willing to work that that that seldom and in those hours and she didn't mind keeping her hand in the business while the kids were growing up as it were and	2361	A
she worked that day and then occasional Saturdays and uh with with the vacation time even if i takeoff the ten or twelve times a	2361	A
a Thursday during the summer i still don't eat up all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then having a day or two left over on top of that so	2361	A
it's it's kind of nice to be able to do both and uh i'll probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
so yeah it's nice to have these little little benefits that i know wouldn't uh wouldn't happen in a real small company several of my friends have left uh the Metroplex is just full of little companies and they've left TI to go to a little company and	2361	A
and ended up you know even though they started with some vacation time uh it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and	2361	A
	2361	A
and uh then they don't have quite the job security although you know now there's a lot of people getting cut but	2361	A
still but by and large the majority of people that are still there in even in the defense industry uh	2361	A
if the job has got something you know something worth doing as far as the contract goes if there is a contract then you're probably pretty secure on that contract	2361	A
and	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
well that's good	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
yeah it's good that you can	2361	A
pick up something that adds to both your your security and your knowledge base	2361	A
you're getting two things at once there	2361	A
well have	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
yeah i've i've looked at several uh	2361	A
courses as it were the only problem that we have is things that are that are specifically on our job	2361	A
uh that the courses that apply to our job other than the real basics like just the math and the physics and the like	2361	A
uh all of them are taught at colleges that are very remote in other words there like there's one in Washington DC and there's one in Oregon	2361	A
and they're they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training but just keeping up on the basics i guess are things that we could continue to do but um	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
well we have we have lots of	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
right	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
<silence>	2361	A
we have lots of uh schools they just only only one in the entire area offers a course in what's called	2361	A
	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
oh i guess uh it's hard tell i guess probably i didn't do much as a kid because we grew up on a farm and my whole life was camping uh but uh	2369	B
later on uh later on i think when my oldest daughter got involved she and i got involved in Indian Princesses we used to go up at Possum Kingdom and do a lot of camping at Possum Kingdom	2369	B
no no i'm i'm New England Massachusetts	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
oh okay	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah that	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
 that's they yeah kind of cheating isn't it	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
no hum	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
oh sure speaking of uh southern Oklahoma uh you go up into the Arbuckle Mountains at all camping up in there	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah we went up to uh i talking about being an Indian Princesses i was actually in it seven years with two daughters four with one three with the other and with my second daughter we camped up at Camp Classen one time	2369	B
and uh well it's right uh	2369	B
you know i'm trying to think where it is it's not too far over the border and it's up in the middle of the Arbuckles and it's near Turner Falls	2369	B
and uh uh that is just absolutely when you consider how flat everything is here that absolutely beautiful company to uh country to camp in	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
oh yeah uh another thing how about uh have you been to the Texans Texoma side	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
oh for goodness sakes that is that is just really nice we kind of	2369	B
you know i've been at TI thirty two years and in my young single days i used to camp there a lot then i sort of forgot about it for twenty years and uh	2369	B
uh two years ago my children started asking- they saw picture of it over at Texans and uh we started going there again we sort of rediscovered it	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah and uh it got a lot a lot of campsites you know there's uh	2369	B
uh concrete pads that you can put tents on there's places to pull in RVs and plug them in up uh there's even two and what we we used	2369	B
they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically uh four walls and a roof log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them and a ceiling fan and screened uh windows	2369	B
so you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag	2369	B
and sleeping bags and air mattresses you can camp on the floor you got a roof over your head	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah let come what may	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah they're very close to the water within like uh a hundred yards	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah yeah they've got a place where you can keep your boat you can they've got the dock that you can tie up tie up and it it's uh it's in a protected area	2369	B
so and i i've got a son	2369	B
really started going about seventeen- he's seventeen now he was he was fifteen then but uh i've got a son son and both daughters like to go and uh they have got a a a dock uh down in the protected area	2369	B
where the fishing pretty good and uh	2369	B
you know we'll leave we'll leave him down there at ten o'clock at night with his fishing pole and sometimes go after him if a big storm comes up	2369	B
but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to uh clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah yeah you you've got to be a a a Texas member but if you are a master member of Texans the the membership to Texoma is free	2369	B
uh you can you can get a family membership do you your family camp at all you you camp with your family how how what what	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
oh boy	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
what kind of a boat do you have	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah when i was yeah in my young in my young single days i had a uh Turbocraft are you familiar with that	2369	B
yeah i had a uh a uh sixteen foot hundred and nine horse power six cylinder one and i i had that for two or three years and then i traded it for a eighteen foot uh two hundred and twenty horsepower V eight	2369	B
and uh oh that thing eat gasoline uh we could suck up thirty gallons in an afternoon of skiing	2369	B
 move you across the water and it would pull three slalom skiers without batting an eyelash	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
yeah plus it it it planed in about two inches of water so you never dragged on anything because there was was nothing under it but unfortunately what i did was and i i guess what what happened when i was single i had it	2369	B
and my wife and i skied a lot when we first got married and the children came along when they're real little they can't really participate and i guess i was paying more on insurance and maintenance than i was getting out of it and i sold it	2369	B
and never had a chance really to get back to boating again	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah you rediscover- rediscover you rediscover it when the kids get old enough to do it yeah	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah right where do you	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
oh okay okay i just i can- i just let me ask you one more question where do you ski uh where you ski	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
um-hum	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah i'll tell you i i would recommend too Texoma is nice because there is no many places you can ski there	2369	B
and uh in the Texans area has got two nice launching ramps	2369	B
one of them is in a protected cove and the other one is okay if the lake is calm it's out more in the open uh the other place that i would really strongly recommend is Possum Kingdom	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
and that is absolutely the prettiest that	2369	B
when i learned to slalom ski it was the only place i didn't mind swallowing and boy i swallowed a lot a lot of water learning and the only place i didn't mind swallowing half the lake and i didn't feel grungy about it like i did at Lavon	2369	B
ah no it's not over crowded it's uh it it far enough away so it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah its too open	2369	B
yeah and there's uh they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around Possum Kingdom and you just get up and ski uh adjacent to those and uh and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is you don't notice it	2369	B
<silence>	2369	B
yeah oh okay well you ready to wind up hey nice talking to you my friend yeah good night bye-bye	2369	B
	2369	B
<silence>	2369	A
how did you first get involved in camping	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
uh-huh	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
are you a native Texan	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh okay	2369	A
i guess i grew up uh camping my folks were big campers from day one as far as i can remember we grew up in southern Oklahoma and they were uh we were always hit Texoma or	2369	A
some camping area all of either Texas or Oklahoma	2369	A
and i was involved in Boy Scouts as a young kid and we were camping uh seem like every other weekend we would go somewhere	2369	A
i when they talk about the definitions of camping it kind of struck me as funny my brother and sister-in-law	2369	A
who live in Arlington and go camping uh a lot during the spring and summer and fall but their idea of camping is a little bit different than mine they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull	2369	A
that has uh you know two bedrooms a TV and microwave and stove and all that kind of stuff and he pulls it with a big pickup	2369	A
when i when i when i go camping i usually take a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and that's about it	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
well it's not like leaving home when you take it with you the whole idea is to get away from it	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
i have been and uh some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
um-hum	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
i'm not familiar with that one	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
boy that's a fact	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah well a lot of my camping was up in the Arbuckles as i was growing up there's a place that used to be called Platte National Park up around Sulphur and Davis and and not too far from Turner Falls	2369	A
they have- i have heard they since changed name of the park to something else but it was one of those parks with a uh a natural	2369	A
uh spring fed river that flows through the camp sites you know all along the river the water was real cold because it was spring fed but just like i say it's a beautiful area lots of hills to go camping in	2369	A
uh dad never believed in tent camping uh we had some old army cots that we would sleep on uh uh come	2369	A
good weather or not a many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes	2369	A
a lot of good memories in in in camping you know it helps you unwind and get away and forget TI and everything else back home i guess	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
no i haven't i've never been up there	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
well that that's true i've never thought- i've heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
well	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
well that would be great there pretty cold-	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
shoot let come what may	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
and they're fairly close to the water aren't they i mean they're right on the late	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
they they got a place where you uh can keep your boat while you're there for the weekend	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
that	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah so it's time to quit	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh that's outstanding	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
i've got a boy that is uh thirteen and the girl is eleven the boy had learned to	2369	A
uh ski oh probably two years ago he's a slalom skier now and the girl's eleven and she just now starting to uh learn to ski	2369	A
i've got a sixteen and a half foot Bayliner it's inboard outboard just a ski boat it's about the right size for us	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah i know them	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
you bet	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
goodness	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah i expect it would	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah but boy it would move you across the water though	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
that's what you want plus out on Texoma you have got all that you know mass of water to get across	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
outstanding	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
uh-huh	2369	A
	2369	A
you're right	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
absolutely that's what happened to us we had a boat for several years in early marriage and along came the kids and it kind of sat there	2369	A
so we wound up selling it and it's been about uh i'd say eleven years uh since we got back into boating and then now they are big enough to	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
you bet plus they can help now too they don't go along for the ride	2369	A
well i guess we've had our uh five minutes uh so we'll yeah- call this thing to a halt i appreciate talking to you Bill	2369	A
sure	2369	A
uh	2369	A
well i had only had the boat two years now uh most of the time we either go out to Lavon or uh we have been going up into Arkansas uh she her parents live up on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas real good it's uh	2369	A
dammed up the uh White River real pretty in Arkansas lake but we are hoping to explore a lot of the lakes around Texas and just stay close to home	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh right yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
 well i have heard a lot about Possum Kingdom	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
it's not over crowded	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
well that see that's one of my biggest gripes about Texoma as many times as we would go up there it's it's so rough	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
that sounds	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
oh no	2369	A
well that sounds like a good place to start out this spring i am looking forward to it	2369	A
<silence>	2369	A
all right thanks a lot Bill nice talking to you good bye	2369	A
	2369	A
<silence>	2350	B
oh just fine	2350	B
oh it's been beautiful here lately	2350	B
yeah i was i was glad that Easter was nice because_1 sounds like you have a child too	2350	B
yeah i've i've got a two year old and we hunted Easter eggs yesterday and the weather was really nice	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
um-hum	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
we had a	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
	2350	B
it was raining last year we had	2350	B
uh-huh we	2350	B
oh oh it was awfully rainy last year it was a it was a very very wet spring remember how they had all that flooding down uh	2350	B
 south of downtown all those people got flooded out	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
oh	2350	B
did it	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
oh really	2350	B
i did	2350	B
 yeah oh gosh yes uh the a lot of people go there	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
i'm i'm we're not from Texas we're from further we're from Missouri so it's it's	2350	B
 the weather down here is a lot different than than it is uh uh at home yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
oh so you're really	2350	B
no i like the winters but i don't like the summers down here it	2350	B
it's terribly hot in the summer here i just	2350	B
when we moved down here our we had a our vehicle didn't have an air conditioner	2350	B
i'm not well we didn't well we really really don't need it very much in Missouri where we're from	2350	B
but um oh we suffered that first summer we traded that thing in as as soon as we could because_1 it just it's indispensable down here to have air conditioning	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
it would be terrible	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
um-hum	2350	B
oh	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
it's	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
oh it is you know uh	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
oh yeah that would be nice oh i- i get the the our electric bill in here July and August is just about kills me it's because_1 it's so hot	2350	B
because_1 i don't think they build them as energy efficient down here as they do up in the north i just really don't	2350	B
because of the winters- winters i kind of miss winter	2350	B
since it it didn't do anything down here this winter	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
no we didn't no we didn't did we	2350	B
that was that is surprising	2350	B
and i- i it was uh really odd	2350	B
but we went home to Missouri at at at Christmas and i- we had well we ran into town and in the ice	2350	B
as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot	2350	B
 so we got our fill we went home at Christmas	2350	B
	2350	B
um-hum	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
i'd rather have the snow than the ice	2350	B
because in Missouri we have a we have a lot of ice	2350	B
and snow but uh but the the ice is really bad	2350	B
because_1 it knocks out power lines and and you just you just absolutely- least at when you've got snow just about everybody has four wheel drive vehicles	2350	B
so the ice you know that's that's a whole	2350	B
you don't- you don't need a four wheel drive vehicle you sit and spin uh	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
uh-huh	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
that's a	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
that'd be nice	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
did you all work at TI uh	2350	B
TI Colorado Springs	2350	B
oh okay we got we had a lot of people from my husband's old group that moved out there	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
and they're still they're still out there though uh	2350	B
	2350	B
did oh they're they are everywhere they	2350	B
 no	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yes uh-huh	2350	B
it just everything just kind of gives up and dies here	2350	B
	2350	B
no it just- the the trees just go to about the first of December and then just oh well it's time to die so it just it's just an ugly mess	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah my grand	2350	B
my grandparents took a tour of the oh of the northeast this past Fall and they really enjoyed it they said the color- color was just fantastic	2350	B
this year	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
well yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
well the maple tree the maple- maple trees have a lot to do with it maples make a lot of nice color	2350	B
which there are none down here	2350	B
it's too hot for them_1	2350	B
we have a lot of Maple trees in Missouri so we have a lot of nice color too but uh the northeast really has the	2350	B
corner on that	2350	B
on the on the real nice color	2350	B
but uh i- i like spring i like i like the reason it's i like that spring comes	2350	B
quickly here	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yes uh yes	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
oh	2350	B
oh definitely	2350	B
oh my my- my two year old she hates to be put- in indoors anyway and just	2350	B
well i think long winters would really mess up mess her up uh	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
um-hum	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
oh whew	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
huh-uh	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
i know	2350	B
<silence>	2350	B
yeah well when we moved down here it was it was June and and it was just like a shock	2350	B
how oh being it's just so much different	2350	B
i mean the heat when it gets hot in Missouri it it it it'll get hot for a couple of days	2350	B
in the in the in the mid to upper nineties and people think it's terrible and then it and it always just goes away	2350	B

<silence>	2350	A
yes you can hear her huh	2350	A

uh-huh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A

so uh yeah i'm glad it was nice too i	2350	A
got a chance to to go outside and	2350	A
just have a nice day	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
the um i remember last year wasn't it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything	2350	A
i'm glad we don't have that this year so far	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
uh-huh	2350	A
we live just north of Trinity Mills and it floods there you know	2350	A
quite a lot um it's not it doesn't usually damage any businesses or anything but you can't get off of thirty five to um	2350	A
to go to Home Depot and that's a problem	2350	A
	2350	A
yes	2350	A
or Target for that matter now	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
uh-huh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
oh yeah	2350	A
yeah we're not from Texas either um	2350	A
we're i grew up in Pennsylvania so	2350	A
	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
it's awfully hot	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
yeah	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
oh you're kidding	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
sure	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
oh i'm sure	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
i- i think you would probably	2350	A
	2350	A
	2350	A
down here yeah i'd just- i think it's a necessity	2350	A
we um	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
we have	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
i guess we bought that my car in Colorado that's where we we moved from and uh	2350	A
so we we had a feeling we'd be coming back this way and again there they don't sell all the cars with air conditioning it's you know it's really a not	2350	A
it's almost a luxury	2350	A
we didn't have air conditioning in our house or anything	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
oh	2350	A
yes it does	2350	A
	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
no i don't think so either no	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
oh no we didn't even have any of the famous Dallas ice storms	2350	A
no isn't that surprising	2350	A
	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
uh-huh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
oh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
oh my gosh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
	2350	A
well you know we lived in Colorado for	2350	A
four years i guess	2350	A
so and we you know we had a lot of snow and i- i really don't miss that	2350	A
my husband says he certainly doesn't mind	2350	A
shoveling- missing the shoveling i mean- we had a big sidewalk and he didn't like that at all but	2350	A
i don't know	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
yeah oh definitely	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
uh-huh	2350	A
	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
that's right	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
it doesn't matter right	2350	A
Colorado wasn't bad for that because um it is so at least in Colorado Springs where we lived it was so sunny most of the time	2350	A
that at right after it snowed it would almost always be a bright sunny day	2350	A
and all of the roads would be clear you'd still have the snow on the yard	2350	A
the kids could play in it but it'd be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
yeah yeah	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
really	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
that's	2350	A
good they scaled down quite a bit they have a lot of changes out there lately	2350	A
	2350	A
	2350	A
but we i don't know i- i- i- i don't really miss the snow i miss the change of seasons myself	2350	A
the fall is what i really miss from Pennsylvania	2350	A
yeah it just turns brown and makes a mess	2350	A
nothing pretty about it	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
um-hum	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
my folks don't live in uh Pennsylvania anymore but for a long time i would purposely go back and visit in October	2350	A
just so i could see the trees and the fall and such a pretty time	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
uh-huh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
it really is and i think you don't	2350	A
i growing up there i just assumed that's how it was all over the country i never really realized it was such a local	2350	A
thing i	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
yeah	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
nope	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
yeah they they do	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
yeah i do too i'm ready to	2350	A
get outside and get the kids outside and	2350	A
seems to just- even my one year old it really changes her temperament she can be in here all grouchy and	2350	A
put her outside and hey she's fine	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
um-hum	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
my my son born- he was born in Colorado and when we first moved here um	2350	A
he was three i guess just turned three	2350	A
and for the first week we were here it was over a hundred every single day it was in July	2350	A
and he was lethargic he really he wasn't used to the heat at all he	2350	A
would go outside and he'd turn into a zombie and walk around like he didn't know what was going on but he's used to it now i think he's i mean	2350	A
he certainly doesn't like the heat but he doesn't become lethargic anymore	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
uh-huh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
uh-huh	2350	A
<silence>	2350	A
that's a good word for it	2350	A
	2350	A
	2350	A
really hot	2350	A
	2350	A
well it's been good talking to you	2350	A
hopefully we'll have some more good weather but	2350	A
we'll see	2350	A
	2350	A
all righty bye-bye	2350	A
	2350	A
<silence>	2393	A
all right	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
yeah	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
how fine	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
um	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
oh boy	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
oh really	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
hm	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
wow	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
hum	2393	A
well we um we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before so	2393	A
we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties so we're just learning the ropes here and	2393	A
but when we moved in um our backyard has so many big tall trees in it that um there just there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard	2393	A
so we're you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass we trying to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me	2393	A
that when i grew up in Missouri and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there it just happened automatically	2393	A
so	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
yes we are we we tried we planted some fescue last um fall	2393	A
and it's- it's really really pretty and um and green it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter	2393	A
and uh	2393	A
and it's pretty good- it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
it's supposed to die off like in August and then you replant- replant it in September	2393	A
and uh	2393	A
so but we don't the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't like i say there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard	2393	A
and um	2393	A
so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers and flower beds or or even gardens that	2393	A
	2393	A
let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
oh yeah	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
oh no	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
on its own	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
hum	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
yes and	2393	A
it's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri i mean it just happened	2393	A
and um so it's been real fun here to see there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies and a lot of people	2393	A
um um we live in north of Dallas and um	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
Plano	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh up north and um	2393	A
and so there's a lot of uh market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for	2393	A
for yards yard work	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
yes they do i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind	2393	A
and so that really cuts into your backyard space and	2393	A
but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much just	2393	A
right now we're just this is we just moved in in September so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the	2393	A
the necessity	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
yeah	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
um	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
hm	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
uh-huh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
grass	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
oh	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
um	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
or what it was	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
well we're going to have to do that because um we have the shade the trees this is an established and older home that we moved into and um	2393	A
the trees are just so tall and there must be what ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that	2393	A
like even if its raining you can go out in our back yard and not get wet	2393	A
	2393	A
well that's what we're looking forward to and that's what they say the payoff is but um	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
	2393	A
	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
too hot yes	2393	A
<silence>	2393	A
well there are all different kinds there	2393	A
you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees	2393	A
there are some big	2393	A
big tall oak trees one across	2393	A
	2393	B
okay well um we lived i grew up in San Antonio and uh i was used to the heat and i was used to what couldn't grow	2393	B
down there and uh	2393	B
we had a small um farm house out in Castroville which is just uh to the west of San Antonio	2393	B
and we did a lot of gardening out there and uh mostly in raised beds so we could keep the uh soil uh nice	2393	B
because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate	2393	B
and when we came up here uh to California uh we're in the Monterrey area and it's very uh nice sandy soil rich soil	2393	B
and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow	2393	B
so we've been out here um well really in in the house since December and we've been uh planting flowers that we could never plant in San Antonio uh	2393	B
because the heat would just dry them up after you know about uh three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started	2393	B
and here they uh are supposed to last year around and so we have some really pretty flowers growing and uh we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of uh pine mulch	2393	B
uh just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here uh just around us you know	2393	B
we got here at the end of about a four year drought	2393	B
uh we've had a whole lot of rain uh it's been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe one day of break for about a month	2393	B
so yeah we're getting replenished and so there is uh	2393	B
when i first came here it everything was yellow the grass was dead everywhere	2393	B
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer	2393	B
but uh that has been uh the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and	2393	B
uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend	2393	B
but um we're just so happy to see green it's just so nice we haven't really done too much else other than that	2393	B
	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
oh uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
 so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass is that what you're	2393	B
	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
oh okay does that last through the summer too	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
um	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
oh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
just get grass to grow i know	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
well when we had our house um out in Castroville the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are a third of an acre and	2393	B
trying to keep grass alive during a summer on uh a piece of ground that big was expensive	2393	B
and to water it and uh eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well i guess it was the year before now uh it was so hot that year that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in February	2393	B
um we were just watering all the time finally what we did was we said we're going to have to let the back yard die it's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because we can't really afford the front yard	2393	B
and uh so when we left you know the back yard had	2393	B
and the Saint um i think it was Saint Augustine that we had um it- it had held onto a small portion but primarily once the weeds start in the back	2393	B
yeah we were just resigned- you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that you know if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again	2393	B
but i don't know that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a a large lawn alive	2393	B
that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out	2393	B
so	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
 Arlington area	2393	B
okay Plano uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
yeah i imagine so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular	2393	B
especially in um the Dallas area you know there's there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and	2393	B
another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
yeah	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
right i know oh it's it's awful the first house well the- our house in Castroville was the first one too	2393	B
and uh we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into	2393	B
and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water	2393	B
and uh the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground uh irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in	2393	B
that was	2393	B
that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient they would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would water their lawn and they didn't have to worry about it at all	2393	B
and that was so nice but we didn't have that luxury so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere and uh	2393	B
so i hope you can find uh i don't know what type of grass grows in uh the real shady areas i remember the guy that was on the radio	2393	B
um they had a gardener	2393	B
and he i don't know i had this one well i've still got the book it's um i think it's just called Texas Gardening and it talks about the different grasses to use uh for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas	2393	B
and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant but i don't remember what it is but it's got like a boot on the front of the the book	2393	B
it's just a real fancy decorated boot it's like Texas Gardening	2393	B
and it talks about um you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune	2393	B
but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about uh the grass and there there being the shade tolerant types of grass and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used	2393	B
but i don't remember- i don't remember if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine or or what but i do remember they had used a blend	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
oh	2393	B
but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that so you'll be cool all year around in the summer that's great	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
	2393	B
it makes the biggest difference	2393	B
when you have the big old trees	2393	B
and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot and they just had their brand new little trees They didn't have any shade they any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day	2393	B
so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there	2393	B
oh that's even better	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
oh	2393	B
<silence>	2393	B
uh-huh	2393	B
	2375	A
good morning do you have a computer- a personal computer	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
oh	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
um-hum	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
um-hum	2375	A
um i have one uh a Wang or um sorry a Compaq portable that my son picked up at one point	2375	A
uh without documentation so it was very cheap it's a two eighty six	2375	A
so it has no hard drive	2375	A
um so that's limiting i tend to use it to log into the the mainframe at work	2375	A
and then i have a a Mac that i use for graphics and	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
um i don't there's something about the Mac- a lot of things about the Mac i don't like i don't like the size of the screen i have an old uh Plus i don't like the keyboard but i- it's extremely easy to use	2375	A
and it's very good for for graphics and actually i- i mean it's to the point where programs are easily- readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it	2375	A
i have um uh it's not really a budget package but a a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
right and i mean you can you can buy an extra screen but but it's somehow because the screen comes with it it it always looks awkward to have the two screens	2375	A
and i found uh my son is um uh second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all	2375	A
and so he when teachers said you know you have to type your papers at least with a Mac he was willing to sit down and type his paper and um	2375	A
 now he does play with with the the you know IBM clone	2375	A
but um and has learned quite a bit about it and tends to use it instead of instead of instead of the Mac so even without any propaganda and stuff he he seems to have switched	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
uh no i mean he sees it as a tool much as i do	2375	A
and um he no he's in international studies	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
so he's basically you know whatever- whatever the computer can do for you fine i'll learn enough to to make it work well for me but i'm not gonna be a guru	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
um-hum	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
right	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
but i think that is it is very frustrating because you know you're sure you did X	2375	A
and it just doesn't work and and so you tell somebody who knows about computers and they say no you obviously didn't do that because the computer doesn't doesn't balk	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A
	2375	A
right and talk to them_1 and yell at them_1	2375	A
<silence>	2375	A

um-hum i've i've heard a lot of wonderful things about the Mac except it does have a limitation as far as the screen goes	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B
that's true that's very true	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B
um-hum	2375	B

uh-huh	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B
um-hum	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B
 is he interested in computers then did this give him an interest in it other than you know using it more as or less like a word- a word processing machine he	2375	B
as a tool um-hum okay	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B
oh that sounds interesting too	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B
	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B
uh-huh i understand that you have to have a certain i mean either you like them or you don't i think a lot of the people are afraid of them	2375	B

<silence>	2375	B
uh-huh	2375	B
<silence>	2375	B

so anyway i guess you have to have a sense a humor too	2375	B
when you're working with them	2375	B
so um-hum yell at them_1 and like to choke them_1 so many times i wanna choke mine say you're not doing what i want you to do	2375	B

<silence>	2375	B
right exactly and it seems a shame to have all that equipment but uh not do anything with it but one day i hope to do more	2375	B
	2375	B
 but uh in my spare time someday i- i hope to do something more with it i have a lot a ideas but putting them_1 into work is another story	2375	B

really	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
well that's interesting	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
a what	2354	A
oh really well that sounds interesting my mom always wants me to open a health food store but i'll i'm not really into it i don't know the information- i don't know that much about it so anyway but well that's interesting i personally i like mostly	2354	A
um if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section i mean that to me is just ridiculous it's like life is to interesting to read fiction but	2354	A
i always get books like um i like to quilt well i'm not into quilting but i check a lot of books out to learn how i just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book but	2354	A
i like to um can and do food preservation and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff	2354	A
and i like to check books out like that and i always come away with i'm a Christian and i enjoy reading books about um i like- i have a real heart for people involved in cults	2354	A
and so i have a real you know heart for them and i'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today and that's just where my heart is so i read a lot of books on that and	2354	A
and you know Christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff and	2354	A
i read the Bible i don't read the Bible as much as i should but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did so but i do enjoy reading that and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading	2354	A
but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the street with it and you you can probably hear him but um i don't know so do you enjoy reading anything like that um	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
thirty or younger	2354	A
is that what you said	2354	A
oh ten years younger oh that's funny	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
oh really	2354	A
yeah Maureen Solomon i had a a friend of mine has a book by her right now called Foods That Heal	2354	A
they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc	2354	A
so anyway i've been taking enough zinc you know to kill a horse probably i hope it doesn't hurt me but anyway i did read one chapter of that	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
no i haven't	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
the quantities and	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
what's the name of it again	2354	A
Life Extension	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
um-hum	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh oh really	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
um-hum	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
really	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
um-hum	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
oh really	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
really	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
i know there's not any food that you can get	2354	A
and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my my husband's uncle owns a big- um some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas	2354	A
and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but	2354	A
i know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you but God still somehow makes us all	2354	A
be able to still live i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but	2354	A
i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be	2354	A
but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but	2354	A
i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just	2354	A
i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think	2354	A
i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the	2354	A
you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and	2354	A
you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical but anyway so	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
because it's what	2354	A
oh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
	2354	A
um	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
really	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
really you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only i just took this Amish bread out of the oven man it's going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that	2354	A
and um i've all my relatives my mom- you know you probably read Back To Eden or something i don't know we read a lot i know people have read all those books but	2354	A
the um they drilled- they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it was three or four times deeper than it needed to be	2354	A
and so their water comes out they live in Grand Prairie but it's they live kind of in a the planes go right over from DFW so it's not real developed and so they have a probably half an acre	2354	A
and yeah and they drilled this well and the water comes out at thirty two degrees so it's kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that	2354	A
<silence>	2354	A
<silence>	2354	B
uh mainly the the books i read are uh business related	2354	B
or self improvement um i've got a a uh small company on the side	2354	B
that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh	2354	B
important issues such as a you know taxes and	2354	B
business expenses and all those kind things	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
um i've got a uh small distributorship uh i uh	2354	B
sell a uh	2354	B
healthy cookie on the side	2354	B
and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the uh from the main- from the supplier	2354	B
and then i distributed them and then i can- i get i can sell them at a cheaper price plus i've got a uh drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done	2354	B
a drinking water business uh yeah yeah	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
 sounds like it	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
um i haven't really read anything like that in in in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did uh had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about uh ten years younger	2354	B
and uh had	2354	B
	2354	B
about ten years younger yeah	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
and um uh the- the problem that i've i've had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five um i've	2354	B
tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library and it i've been moderately successful	2354	B
uh with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books but um they they uh they do read them um	2354	B
i have some books on on health that i read all the time one's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing but yeah i i'm	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
there's a uh a couple called um oh i'm going to forgot his name now uh Dirkson	2354	B
um and uh there's a book called Life Extensions i don't know if you've ever heard of it	2354	B
okay it's a book called Life Extensions there's also a book called The Life Extension Companion uh Dirk Pearson and	2354	B
oh i forgot Sally's last name	2354	B
anyway it's a couple i've i've seen them on TV	2354	B
and uh they have- they are pretty down to earth about uh	2354	B
what you can take and and what you can't take and um	2354	B
the quantities what are good for you what isn't and um Life Extensions	2354	B
uh yeah he's probably about forty years old now i saw him probably seven years ago on Johnny Carson Show	2354	B
and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs	2354	B
you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run	2354	B
and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old	2354	B
and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age	2354	B
and of course Sally uh isn't a very big woman i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S	2354	B
and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises	2354	B
uh together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
yes	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
yes	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
yeah there's i've i've read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three um and it's amazing that the the legislation they have	2354	B
um for food that doesn't apply to water they don't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you	2354	B
through your pipes because it's toxic um chlorine it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer	2354	B
they know that they've proven that	2354	B
um yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i've i've read books that	2354	B
uh have proven that there is a link between the {ingestation} of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack	2354	B
and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty	2354	B
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
yeah i'm very familiar with the area	2354	B
<silence>	2354	B
it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the	2354	B
<silence>	2367	A
um casual ones but with class you know not too fancy but uh i i won't go to a fast food place	2367	A
i really can't stand those uh	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
um	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
quality of the food	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
you had a good time there	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
okay	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
um	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah that's true	2367	A
there's some places though that i go to because i like the food there and i kind of they don't have the best service or they're not the friendliest but i'll i'll tolerate it just because i know that's the kind of food i want to eat	2367	A
and there's other places but like you said the the food doesn't matter it's you have such a good time there	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah i have not in not in a good while but	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
just to see the show just to see the show right	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
um	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
um	2367	A
yeah that sounds pretty wild	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
predictable yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah that does sound like a pretty neat idea	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
well there's this uh there's this type kind of restaurant called a brew pub are you familiar with those	2367	A
where they they brew their own beer there	2367	A
yeah and there's i used to live in Colorado and there was a lot of them there and there's actually there's two in the Raleigh area	2367	A
 and uh i'm a i'm a home brewer myself so i just am envious of these people and you go there and a couple you have gone to you can order like a sampler	2367	A
and and while you're eating your meal and usually their food is good too they they bring out six different kinds of beer that they brewed on the premises and you just test it's like uh beer tasting thing while you're eating your meal and it's really neat	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
um	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah i usually don't go somewhere that's too far away	2367	A
but uh	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah well i guess for like lunch places that's really important because you usually that much time or or whatever	2367	A
oh so that's why we're getting all these Dallas people that's what i figured but	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
i didn't i don't want to assume that that's what i figured no i'm a college- i'm a university student so uh	2367	A
that also has a has a little bit of bearing on what restaurant choices you have when you're flat broke all the time	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
but uh i'm going to be starting working full time this summer so maybe maybe my restaurants will change	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
um-hum	2367	A
no well actually i graduated	2367	A
	2367	A
i took one semester off and and i've been taking a class- at least one class every semester	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
right	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
um	2367	A
i've become a lot more health conscious and that's why i stopped eating fast food and places like that	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
i used to love hamburger joints and i don't go to them i don't eat hamburgers anymore but	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
	2367	A
i used to just i i used be a connoisseur of hamburger places	2367	A
	2367	A
Mike's Grill that's the place to go for the best burger	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
now i go for the best place to get uh tofu or whatever	2367	A
not quite that bad but uh	2367	A
	2367	A
<silence>	2367	A
yeah good talking to you we'll see you later bye-bye	2367	A
	2367	A
	2367	B
all right well what kind of uh restaurants what type restaurants you like to go to	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
yeah	2367	B
um do you like i mean what is it about uh the the kind of restaurants you go to that you like i mean what makes you like i said what makes you want come back	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
is it well see uh qualities one thing but to me	2367	B
the uh not necessarily just the friendliness of the service but the service is real important to me	2367	B
uh i will go back to a place where uh i smile during the meal you know and just not just because of the food but i mean because either the waiter or the waitresses	2367	B
yeah exactly uh that's real important to me i i can't stand going to a stuffy place i mean it's just that's not me um in your you know like you said fast food restaurants aren't any good either	2367	B
but uh you know i don't necessarily- uh you know there's a place here uh it's um it's good- it's a barbecue place and it's uh you know you go through a line and and get your stuff	2367	B
but they make it fun you know they they they the people behind the counter are are laughing and and joking with you all the time and i you know that's one reason why i like to go back	2367	B
you know the food is excellent obviously that that is like i said that is important	2367	B
but um you know if i don't know that i would go back as often if it wasn't for the idea that i have fun there	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or or uh things like that	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
well see i'm uh i've been to dinner theaters but the- every time i go it's you know on the {nonmeal} show type- you know type thing so i've it's been a while since i've been to one uh	2367	B
yeah yeah um normally its comedy i i enjoy comedy although there's one that i'm i'm really looking forward to going to in the next couple of weeks it's a i just found out that well i'm sure they've they've had them for a along time but it's uh	2367	B
it's like a mystery uh theater uh that you you know you eat dinner and all through dinner they're they're doing this act and they they get supposedly get the uh the audience involved in it and everything and that that sounds like that would be hilarious you know	2367	B
cause- because_1 i love watching mysteries on on TV anyway and i love figuring them_1 out before they do you know	2367	B
of course that's probably a lot easier on TV to figure it out than it is in other things because TV they have a tendency to do a lot of things uh	2367	B
that aren't you know what i mean um predictable exactly but i mean you know the the dinner a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild i don't know	2367	B
yeah	2367	B
so um i mean is there anything else about a restaurant that would make you go back though	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
no hadn't heard of them	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
oh yeah	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
um	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
yeah that sounds kind of neat	2367	B
uh is location at all important to you	2367	B
like you know how far it is from your house or whatever	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
well yeah i i guess	2367	B
yeah i i think my favorite restaurant is always been the one closest you know the closest- as long as it's it's it meets the minimum criteria you know of good food	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
um no kidding	2367	B
	2367	B
working for TI that's pretty important	2367	B
yeah yeah	2367	B
	2367	B
so yeah that	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
oh okay	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
oh yeah money does	2367	B
 yeah i can see that	2367	B
so	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
so you graduating- are graduating or	2367	B
yeah well maybe i don't know i'd uh i really haven't changed that much since i was in school- in school um of course you know i'm not sure you ever get out of school to tell you the truth and uh	2367	B
depending on what industry you get into or whatever like uh you know TI being electronics uh you never get out of school so you know	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
yeah well like i said though my my change- my taste in in food really hadn't changed all that much in in restaurants i mean a little bit yeah uh especially in you know i didn't have the money to go to these dinner theaters and stuff before	2367	B
whereas i you know i have gone to a couple of these things before- you know lately and you know it's like i said i missed the dinner- dinner part of it but i've gone to the theater	2367	B
uh but i you know like i said that's that's probably so price really i guess does have a lot to do with it i hadn't even really considered that before	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
um	2367	B
yeah	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
yeah well that's probably true to so	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
	2367	B
well unfortunately i'm not as good about that as you are i still go every once one in awhile	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
	2367	B
yeah well it's like i said you know the different there are different reasons for different things like that and you know hey you're right health is one thing that just	2367	B
<silence>	2367	B
i was i was wondering yeah	2367	B
well all right well i think that should just about do it	2367	B
yeah take care uh-huh bye	2367	B
	2367	B
	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
community doing on recycling	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah sounds like an exciting one	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
where- where do you live	2352	B
do they have the uh collection points where you can oh okay	2352	B
yes we're we're really behind the times here about all we've got is paper recycling and aluminum from cans uh North Carolina	2352	B
um i buy- i keep my newspapers and take those down and aluminum cans i keep those if i ever get them_1 i don't drink Cokes or anything like that so i don't don't usually get any aluminum cans	2352	B
but that's that's all they've got set up they've got a uh central collection point at the JC Park and uh that's it	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah and you and you and- and you also get rid of it so	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
oh yeah yeah that's why i just let it sit there and let it uh let it uh rot away and it's a good fertilizer	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
oh that's right	2352	B
surprised you even have grass there	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
uh	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
exactly	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
hum	2352	B
yeah i've seen i've seen pictures of uh seals that have gotten uh gotten their necks stuck in those uh plastic uh	2352	B
oh what do you call them_1 they hold six packs together those plastic-	2352	B
yeah because_1 they they're they're playful and they think this is fun we'll stick our head through here and they get their head stuck in there and they can't get out and they strangle	2352	B
and i	2352	B
or they starve because_1 they can't eat	2352	B
yeah i mean it's that's yeah that's that's terrible i mean i like seals	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
yeah that's what it bothers me the same thing about uh netting tuna they they get so many dolphins	2352	B
and	2352	B
and i	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
well they keep saying that but i'll tell you i i saw a program not too many months ago	2352	B
i think it was on Arts and Entertainment or Discovery one of the two and they're talking about all these people who are making uh all these boast that you know we're dolphin free and all that kind of stuff and they just they showed them_1 to be absolute liars	2352	B
yeah because you know people like Starkist they don't go out there and catch the fish they buy the fish from other people	2352	B
and and and all these people do is tell them oh no no no no we have we have these safety nets now	2352	B
sure	2352	B
that's right trust us	2352	B
yeah they had some they had some uh	2352	B
uh undercover film of these people and they they netted oh i mean dozens of dolphins	2352	B
and they killed probably half of them_1	2352	B
yeah it is i like dolphins too	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um right right	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
well i think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of shrimp farming	2352	B
i mean there's- there's i- i don't see any reason why they can't uh i mean there's a lot of places Japan for instance have shrimp farms i mean they they they raise shrimp	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
just- just like they raise anything else and and you can do it and the uh the the collection is very easy	2352	B
and you don't go around killing everything else that happens to be in the area	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
right- right	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
on fishing yeah	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah well it's	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah and	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah is right yeah they're they're they're in it for a matter of survival not	2352	B
not environmentalist	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
oh yeah they they probably are i	2352	B
of course i don't understand why they don't if they're going to kill them_1 they might as well eat the turtles too and	2352	B
they probably do i mean	2352	B
	2352	B
oh turtle is good	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
 yeah	2352	B
yeah i had turtle when i was in Vietnam didn't know it was turtle at the time because_1 i wouldn't have eaten it but	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah i	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah that's true	2352	B
	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
	2352	B
well hopefully it's real turtle too	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah you well that's that's the other thing i mean you never know what they're putting in there you know oh this is turtle soup you know okay	2352	B
sure right	2352	B
yeah why not give it a fancy name and put a high price tag on it	2352	B
it's probably it's probably Campbells or something	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
no i i no- no i don't think we will because_1 you need- you need some kind of organization for it and	2352	B
yeah and the problem- the problem i mean we've got all these environmental organizations but they're all pulling in different directions and it's the the end results is is just a nullity nobody's getting anything done	2352	B
and and i think there needs to be a concerted effort you know say okay here's a problem we're going to do this and you put all your resources here and we're going to do this and you put your resources here something like that i mean just	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah well that's what- that's what i mean about all these groups they're so	2352	B
yeah they're so uh	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
they	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
yeah i mean would- i mean you'd ideally they would all combine together and pool there resources and and	2352	B
and then they could have their agenda for all these different problems and come up with solutions but i mean you know work at it as an organization not as a little group	2352	B
 just- they just don't get anywhere	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
that's right that's right	2352	B
<silence>	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
exactly	2352	B
yeah somebody to pull the whole thing together to make it work	2352	B
i mean we we've been at this for for so many years now and just- and just and nothing's happening	2352	B
	2352	A
the topic is how we can how-	2352	A
how what is our	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
and how and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well it is to me uh because	2352	A
we're our particular little household is hot and heavy we have our glass bin our tin bin and uh our uh	2352	A
papers that we accumulate and recycle and	2352	A
Plano Texas	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
yes they certainly do they certainly do	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
where are you	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
oh i see	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well our libraries and then the uh Wal-Mart stores have the bins in back of them_1 and when you recycle glass	2352	A
that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans	2352	A
so when you get all of that going it is it it occupies a space in your garage but you very quickly get use to it and we do not	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
sure well you know we haul it off it- once in a while and we also do not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not fill	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well this is Texas it doesn't set it blows	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
give	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
lots of grass give it twenty four hours and the whole things gone there's no problem someone else is worrying about	2352	A
and we have somebody else's but uh the problem that bothers me more uh you know i think the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local government you know	2352	A
if there's if there's enough need and they have a responsive local city management	2352	A
it will happen	2352	A
what upsets me uh there was an article and i'm sorry i was reading a book at the same time it was on our Texas beaches	2352	A
and they are saying- our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the United States	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
and it's not because of litter it's because of boats	2352	A
the if you could think of the basin the Texas gulf coast as a large swirling	2352	A
vacuum things that are thrown from ships swirl in and swirl in to our beaches	2352	A
and it kills some of our animals	2352	A
there's there's a professor down there that has Texas A and M has a nice size facility	2352	A
at Port Aransas	2352	A
and he's got all these collection of animals that he's frozen that were killed you know by plastic	2352	A
it's horrible it's a gross collection	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
um-hum	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
yes whatever those things- nasty things are	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
that's right or they starve to death because they can't swallow	2352	A
or drowned	2352	A
yeah	2352	A
terrific	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some uh plastic	2352	A
and it starved to death it couldn't it couldn't swallow it was pitiful	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well they're suppose to have- be working towards- around that	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
uh-huh	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
oh really	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
sure so	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
trust us it's our nets everything's great go back sleep and don't worry	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
oh	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
oh that's just sickening	2352	A
	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well and the other thing uh we have an endangered species turtle a Ridley's turtle	2352	A
that's on the Texas Gulf Coast	2352	A
and there's our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles can swim through	2352	A
huge fight going on	2352	A
uh the shrimpers just say great you want us to put a big hole in our nets is that what you want us to do this makes sense to us we're starving to death anyway and you want us to put a hole in our nets i can see their point	2352	A
i i guess if my family were terribly hungry i wouldn't be as humanistic as i am because i don't have that problem	2352	A
so it's it's really a hard hard issue to say what's right and what's not	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
oh this is	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
like they raise catfish now	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money	2352	A
we have a lot of Vietnamese	2352	A
fisher people	2352	A
and yet- they support their whole family on less than than i'd had for lunch	2352	A
anyway	2352	A
and of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that	2352	A
and it it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that	2352	A
that they it would have to be government owned or supported- financed if not controlled	2352	A
there because the financing simply isn't there	2352	A
because it's one of those cottage industries that uh	2352	A
the very poor keep going but can't do anything to change	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
sure	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well and you know they could they could be terribly sorry they're killing the turtles you know	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
probably are probably are	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well they may do it	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
whether they like it or not they may do it you know	2352	A
yeah- that's correct turtle is very good that's the other thing wrong with the poor turtles	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well in my unreformed days i have had turtle soup in New Orleans and i can tell you it's fabulous	2352	A
but of course a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
 so it's no telling what the turtle really taste like	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
well it maybe it wasn't you know who who knows what i had but it was fabulous	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
great sure it is	2352	A
charge fifteen keep moving	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
as long as it's French	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
oh dear well i don't have any my big solutions all go back to elect politicians that are more sensitive because i think we can't do it ourselves	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
you need clout	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
it'd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing	2352	A
you know like the woman down the tip of Texas that that	2352	A
calls her turtles and kisses everyone of them_1 everyday she's terribly interested in her turtles she could care less about shrimp	2352	A
and on she goes you just kind of think everybody's got such a splintered interest	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
yeah that's exactly it	2352	A
and there's no way to to to make one group more interested or sensitive to the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line which means money	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
that's why i keep going back to the politicians that it has to have some focal spot	2352	A
we we need uh we need an environmental Ralph Nader type	2352	A
which	2352	A
	2352	A
gee	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
right	2352	A
<silence>	2352	A
okay	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
well if uh i like to do- i like to make stuffed animals i i sort of have not been doing as much as i did you know before i had to work for real but i like to do things like that and uh	2317	A
you know bottle covers and	2317	A
that sort of stuff and dancing	2317	A
the dancing i've i've kept up with because you know you don't have to	2317	A
well you don't have to get a lot of stuff out you know	2317	A
what do you do	2317	A
oh	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh wow	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah yeah	2317	A
wow	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah and then it then it puts a lot of responsibility on you	2317	A
yeah yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh well that yeah	2317	A
 yeah i like to sew too but you know if i'm not in the mood to sew i can screw things up like you wouldn't believe	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah and then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years at least	2317	A
oh do you really	2317	A
oh wow how exciting	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh i'll bet	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
uh-huh	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh that's neat	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
is it is it hard to make it come down where you want to	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh it just comes down when it wants to	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
uh-huh	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
right yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah well have you flown in one of those where they have a whole bunch that go you know like up at one time	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah how long have they been doing that	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh well that's neat	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
what about that one they do in Albuquerque	2317	A
yeah that's the oldest one isn't it	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
wow	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
 how many do they have like at the Plano one usually	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah probably every year it'll	2317	A
yep	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah because_1 those things are pretty expensive aren't they	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah i had a friend at TI Detroit a long time ago that had one that a bank	2317	A
you know had sponsored	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
and it looks so pretty when they're all you know when there's a bunch of them_1 that way	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
wow	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
sounds fun	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh i like to read too what kind of books do you like	2317	A
 yeah i like those i like mysteries- i like murder mysteries too	2317	A
have you ever read any Dean Koontz	2317	A
he's he's sort of it's he he's writes real good but- usually- it's the kind though that you don't want to start if you have to put it down very soon	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah the he does well they're sort of scary	2317	A
you know but they're they're just really really good	2317	A
The Watchers you know they made a movie of The Watchers here not too long ago	2317	A
and that was a book that he wrote that that was my favorite one it's about this dog named Einstein	2317	A
and this it was- he was an experimental government thing you know	2317	A
and they were trying to do like like robotic stuff and everything	2317	A
yeah yeah well the the book was just ever so much better	2317	A
yeah it was great	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
	2317	A
you like uh uh who is it uh Victoria	2317	A
Victoria Holt is that right	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah those are good i like those	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
oh really	2317	A
well that's i	2317	A

<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A

well you know it's it's real funny because_1 when i first started it was like i saw someone at a Halloween party this lady was from Turkey and she'd been belly dancing since she was four years old you know so i thought well jeez you know that looks like fun i'll learn that in a couple of weeks ha	2317	A
 yeah you know i mean you could just you could just take lessons forever- forever i think	2317	A
course i'm tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but it's a lot of fun and it's it's a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you don't realize you're getting exercise	2317	A
you know it's so much fun you don't really think about it	2317	A
and exercising i mean let's face it exercising stinks	2317	A

<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah that's a lot of fun	2317	A
well yeah that's the same kind of thing like belly dancing you know you don't really realize that you're working as hard as you are	2317	A
yeah and it's sort of cute too	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
yeah well see i belong to the fitness center so i feel like i have to go to the aerobics class to get my money's worth you know	2317	A

<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A

<silence>	2317	A
um-hum yeah and yeah that's handy and they're just there you know when you want to use them_1	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
and i i did the family thing so my sweetie could go too	2317	A

 but he likes the weights and the you know stationary bicycle and all that	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A
 body build huh	2317	A
<silence>	2317	A

or maybe little kids i've i've done weddings but not not- not big weddings like you know	2317	B
big big weddings just bride's maid's dresses and stuff like that for people that i know	2317	B
you know so	2317	B
 i don't want to be paid to do it because_1 then it becomes a job and then it's not a hobby you know	2317	B
<silence>	2317	B
and a lot of stress too	2317	B
you know especially i don't want to do this and i don't want to do that so it's then it's not a hobby it's more of a job but i like to sew you know it calms me down	2317	B
	2317	B
<silence>	2317	B
oh yes and then i go ballooning	2317	B

and i always tell people if you ever go up in one you just that's it you be hooked	2317	B
and they're so pretty and you know	2317	B
<silence>	2317	B
well you don't have a choice	2317	B
well you don't have a choice of where you're going	2317	B
so when you get ready to come down you have to you know you- it's more or less like letting the air out he can land more or less where he wants to it's just that there's no like if he wanted to go one place he would have to know which way the wind is blowing	2317	B
	2317	B
<silence>	2317	B
yeah that's just Plano they have Plano festival	2317	B
uh	2317	B

<silence>	2317	B
yeah	2317	B
yeah now banks they sponsor different banks out here like Bank One sponsored one one year	2317	B
and i can't think of the rest of them_1 but they they you know they have sponsors for certain balloons and all they do is just put the name of the bank or whoever's sponsoring that balloon- that balloon yeah it's pretty good	2317	B
<silence>	2317	B
uh	2317	B
oh yeah and it's so peaceful we went out to Texas Stadium one time for a Boy Scout jamboree	2317	B
and we we was inside of the stadium like like i was thinking it the Astrodome	2317	B
and they filled it up the football field	2317	B
and inflated all the balloons	2317	B
and it's it was so pretty that if you got way up at the top it looked like you could just dive off and and and bounce on a bunch of pillows you know it was good it was fun i had fun	2317	B
but that that's my that's probably my main hobby that sewing and reading books that's about it	2317	B

should we have been there	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
did we do what was correct there	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
should we have fought them harder	2373	B
used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
oh you agree with Schwartzkopf who says uh Drive on into Baghdad	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
would that be so bad	2373	B
was there anything there	2373	B
to begin with	2373	B
	2373	B
it wasn't ours	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
well we've got to talk so it's just just as well we argue	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
i agree	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
wouldn't it have been wonderful	2373	B
if we could have freed the country	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
yeah so other political things that's going on i heard mister Bush say uh excuse me President Bush say that he uh	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B

turn it into	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
interstates like	2373	B
the rest of the country	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B

i uh	2373	B
last weekend went home to visit my parents my dad's in the hospital and uh	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
between	2373	B
here and west Texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
nonstop have you have you ever been out here	2373	B

the Rocky Mountains	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
Yellowstone	2373	B
	2373	B
uh	2373	B

<silence>	2373	B
uh know virtually nothing else uh yeah i got my four year got my BS in General Science	2373	B
yeah i know it's a funny degree uh anyway uh i know nothing other than the west in fact uh	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things i don't understand trees and have	2373	B
the gulf and	2373	B
it's really interesting so tell me about where you live	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
uh how high is the highest elevation	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
like uh probably	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
three thousand foot	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
close to sea level	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
okay uh right here in Colorado Springs where i live	2373	B
it's over six thousand foot	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
um	2373	B
yes when i lived in Texas every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
six eight twelve hours away	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
you know just just for fresh i	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
how many hours have you been from home	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
yes	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
oh yeah	2373	B
uh	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
now when i was growing up	2373	B
in the Panhandle of Texas look at your map later and see the the town of Amarillo	2373	B
fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle to just go buy a pair of jeans we'd drive an hour	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
when i was growing up now things are different and people buy jeans in town but	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hop in you know the car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours	2373	B
	2373	B
yeah it is i imagine	2373	B
	2373	B
okay okay i'll look at my map later	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
wow how neat	2373	B
	2373	B
so are you working your way through college	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
well how neat what's your major	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
finance	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
well that's interesting	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
so uh what do you plan to do with it	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
savings and loans uh	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
oh that would be great that would be neat	2373	B
let's see uh so we're all excited in Colorado Springs Apple Computer is coming to town	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
yes the uh new employer in in the city	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
so we're expecting our local economy to	2373	B
	2373	B
uh maybe not boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
uh	2373	B
unemployment runs approximately six percent	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
but now under employment	2373	B
i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
and the problem is that	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
a technical four year degree	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
yes it is	2373	B
<silence>	2373	B
<silence>	2373	A
okay	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
no i had to press one	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
sure	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
i think we should have stayed longer	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh i think what we did was good but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
yeah i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now And it's almost like they're killing each other off	2373	A
and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
well i think i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
well no i just mean that the world in general	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
yeah	2373	A
Um	2373	A
i don't know i think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
yes But i think that's almost impossible next to impossible	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
oh see i haven't really been keeping up with them so i really don't know what he said what did he say about it	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
we don't have the money for that	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
 It would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes	2373	A
	2373	A
i'm sorry i dropped the phone	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A

um	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh the farthest away from home	2373	A
probably- i'd say five or six	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
oh my	2373	A
oh my gosh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
oh yes Now see for me that's a long ways	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
even well like i i'm in like a little town right now it's smaller than Butler and um	2373	A
Butler Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh So that will give you some idea of where i'm at and i'm about	2373	A
i'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh	2373	A
and uh i mean just this this little town here here is basically a college town	2373	A
the college without the college here this town would be nothing It would be absolutely dead because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants	2373	A
and and in the summer when we come- uh my fiancee's family lives up here we come up here in the summer and it's i mean there's just no one around	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
um well i go home in the summer and i work in the summer and between what i make in the summer and student loans that's how i go to college	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
finance	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
um well like i said my fiancee	2373	A
no No no no um my fiancee works down in D C and i'd actually like to work for a company rather- rather than a bank or a something i'd rather work for a company	2373	A
and um like be their financial advisor or something	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
oh really	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
take a boom a little bit	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
well well what would be the unemployment rate out there	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
see that's what it is here too	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
<silence>	2373	A
yeah It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs	2373	A
i know people that have been out of school for two or three years and they have a job that has nothing to do	2373	A
<silence>	2394	B
well i i think it's been interesting to hear you know about the overall outlook you know before we ended the war what implications we'd be dealing with uh you know the	2394	B
strong religious beliefs and uh you know it's just another	2394	B
uh attitude you know and what we are really getting into and and the fact that that that war you know coalition forces stuck together uh and uh	2394	B
you know i just think now is that they should- they should have finished Saddam off because i think	2394	B
we're just going to see repercussions- repercussions- repercussions down the line because he's he'll probably maintained power it sounds like he's uh you know uh knocked down the revolt you know so	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
or at least got Saddam	2394	B
you know if they you know if they	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah no i i don't think i don't i don't think a lot of them_1 didn't want him to lose control- you know power completely but it's hard to say um	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah to go against- to go after the political heads of state but	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah but	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
anyway but now it looks like uh you know Kuwait has asked us to defend its borders more of a permanent type of basis which will be a first	2394	B
uh	2394	B
so it's interesting uh uh	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
yeah i don't know if the interested- yeah United States is interested as much as establishing a democracy	2394	B
as opposed to just getting rid of Saddam you know it just uh	2394	B
but you know we'll see if if anything if he	2394	B
if he gets stability uh and he doesn't you know get knocked off you know by a coup or something down the line you know what happens you know down the road i just uh it'll be interesting	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
um-hum	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah well it's interesting	2394	B
yeah interesting there's like a two square mile- mile area that's occupied by some Iraqi soldiers and Kuwait's saying it's their land	2394	B
and they have the their line of demarcation is that what they call it uh	2394	B
and they've already outlined that for the cease fire and uh apparently we don't want to deal with that but the Kuwaitis want this land want these this- this- this land back that they're saying it's theirs	2394	B
so that- that was kind of interesting that we said that we said no we're not going to get involved you know we've already established you know the line of cease fire do you you know and the uh demarcation line so	2394	B
um they were definitely trying to avoid any hostilities i thought it was interesting though that we did knock- uh shoot down some of their airplanes when they went up but i don't think they're doing that anymore	2394	B
yeah yeah well well well they warned them_1 they- we told- we told them_1 we would this is after that cease- the cease fire so	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
i don't know maybe they were helicopters i thought they were airplanes- i thought they were letting the helicopters fly around and- and-	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
anyway so it's uh	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yep	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
uh well they hate i mean they hate us over there most those people uh	2394	B
but obviously i think it was	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
influenced- influenced- you know the heads of state obviously you know	2394	B
you know the ones that uh let us in but uh	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
it's- it's- it's that's anyway i would think uh	2394	B
yeah i think it was good that we-	2394	B
that- that we got that you know that	2394	B
you know we drew the line somewhere	2394	B
and uh whether that uh	2394	B
you know what effect it has in the long run you- you know to be all right	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
um-hum and i and i think	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah i the think you know it'll deter the next person from	2394	B
you know uh thinking the same types of things but i think the problem is that we'll never get away from	2394	B
the expansion idea i mean you know we're territory- we're territory in general we're going to run into another you know uh	2394	B
i don't want to go so far and say it's a Hitler but crap Saddam seems like he's as bad as Hitler almost by the way you know they torture and kill people you- you know from what you read but uh	2394	B
you know once the nuclear power you- you know nuclear uh	2394	B
you know bombs uh get in the hands of some of these other countries uh for them to you know who knows uh	2394	B
who may try what down the road	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah that's another thing is that they you know they just they don't understand implications i don't think or or may or may not but um	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
yeah well we'll see and you know it has i most- i may fairly young here i got to	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
they keep saying they think he won't make it but it looks like he's you know taking control of all these cities that were uh besieged by the rebels but sounds like he's gotten control and	2394	B
you know it's just a matter if if he can survive you know without somebody else you know a coup attempt or something	2394	B
um	2394	B
<silence>	2394	B
all righty and uh take her easy all righty bye-bye	2394	B
	2394	B
<silence>	2394	A
i really- i really don't know enough about the Middle East to form solid opinions but i don't uh how about you do you have a solid opinions on on US involvement	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
totally different world	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
hm	2394	A
so you're saying that the coalition forces should've got went ahead and uh gone in and taken out uh Iraq instead of just recapturing Kuwait	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah and well bad thing is i mean you can't do that because the the Saudis asked you know the Saudis were were helping you know out	2394	A
on only under the condition that they would help that the United States and the coalition force would help Kuwait regain their country	2394	A
and otherwise- otherwise otherwise	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
right	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
and plus you know it's illegal you know in uh	2394	A
in uh warfare or any type- or any other kind of uh international	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
to go against the to exactly you can't go after the the leader you can't legally do that i mean then again you know there's people who say war is war everything's fair	2394	A
but that's just not it's it's like some you know a Geneva convention or something like that said it	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
but	2394	A
yeah it's it's but it's it's it's it's very hard to deal with people that don't believe- don't believe in the same things and don't live the same way that you do you know it's like as we think that	2394	A
Saddam Hussein ruined the country and that	2394	A
that that Iraq would be much better with a democracy so that the people could decide what they want	2394	A
but then again you got you have all the Palestinians that that think that this Saddam Hussein is is a you know is a God is is- is someone that's going to relieve them of all their troubles and how can you get across to people that	2394	A
think that you know their savior you're telling them_1 that their savior	2394	A
is a person of empty promises you can't you know it's hard it's hard to do that so it's hard to change a different- a country especially in the Middle East which has different views on life	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
getting him out yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
i think i think the United States should uh stick around and play a role but i don't think that United States should uh get directly involved from now on they should kind of stay stay on the outside of uh	2394	A
of the events you know kind of	2394	A
i don't know how to say it- how to say it exactly in words but you know just kind of stay with one eye looking in the situation make sure that	2394	A
United States can go in when need be you know it's not like uh uh that- we'll be ready if they ever ask for help	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
so there's already some trouble brewing huh	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
you mean after the cease fire	2394	A
well i think	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah the well i think uh they they also shot down some gunships is that what you're talking about the the uh helicopter gun ships that that they shot down	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
because uh what i heard was that the that the the military was was uh shooting down civilians and and um anti Hussein	2394	A
troops with gun ships	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
it's a mess it's hard it's hard for two different societies to get together and and try to help each other mutually when they don't agree on so many things	2394	A
and then you know and then and especially with the Middle East the way it is they the too -insane you know these these the Arabs are fighting amongst themselves and then one Arab decides to ask	2394	A
a non Arab for help and that just kind of turns everybody else against them_1 like you know that's why the Palestinians were were rooting for or were pulling for Hussein because they're all Arabs	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
and they really didn't like the idea of the United States coming in and helping out Kuwait who was so rich	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
oh well	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah i think we did the right thing	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
right	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
well i think it deterred i think it deterred Hussein from doing anything else because if we- if for example we we let Hussein go in there and take Kuwait then	2394	A
it could have been just like uh you know World War Two because- it may you know because Hitler got little bit of what he wanted here he'd try it again and got some more he'd try again and got some more	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
right	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
right	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah because they don't have anything to lose so they'll go ahead and use them_1	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
um-hum	2394	A
but they have less to lose if they use them_1 you know it's like they're they're third world countries they you know they they're like their their people are in bad shape well we'll go ahead and use it and	2394	A
put some other country in our shape see that's the way they think	2394	A
so	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
it'll be interesting to see how it turns out now you know who who does what if Hussein actually stays in power or not	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
we'll see all right well hey it was nice talking to you	2394	A
<silence>	2394	A
yeah you too bye	2394	A
	2394	A
	2308	A
so um well i'll tell you my situation is uh i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home	2308	A
and um her son which is my father	2308	A
is also elderly and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years now my father's almost eighty my grandmother's almost ninety seven	2308	A
so um	2308	A
it's strange because it it so hit so close to home	2308	A
but um um my father's an only child and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother she had many sisters and a couple of them took care of her	2308	A
and then one her last sister died and it was	2308	A
probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was	2308	A
and plus she was driving my father crazy she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers so she's kind of cranky to get along with there's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very very old	2308	A
but her personality is is very grating i mean i hope i don't get like that when i get old so	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
yeah you don't know if their complaints are legitimate	2308	A
um we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural uh maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one	2308	A
um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like there were some really nice ones here all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations	2308	A
um this one is more or less for someone who who's poor and can't go there and my father's is he's no by no means wealthy but he's quite well off	2308	A
and he could he could easily have put her into a nicer um home but up here there's waiting lists and that was the first one that opened and i suggested to him why don't you change	2308	A
um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her and he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice	2308	A
so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job	2308	A
i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that but i have heard of really awful conditions	2308	A
especially down the southern part of the state- the country which is	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
oh that's terrible	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
well that's good so is your grandmother um impaired is she of Alzheimer's or something like that	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
 oh	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
oh that does happen yeah	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
yep	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
you know my neighbors across the street their uh mother was sick at times and	2308	A
they they couldn't handle her so they put her in a home and then uh the old Frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother i guess i'll look after her and- and that what happens a lot when when people are sick	2308	A
or they just real manic depressants they end up being put in homes and it's like oh well but that's it's it's i'm really glad that i come from an area where um	2308	A
that there's good people in the homes but it's just as it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place	2308	A
they still don't want to go to these homes and my grandmother's real there i mean she cries every day this has been over a year and she tries to make me feel really guilty but i have to you know	2308	A
i have to put my foot down where where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really feel- i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother i don't really um	2308	A
when my father when something if anything happens to him	2308	A
i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home and hopefully that he he can uh get along with uh	2308	A
in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day	2308	A
because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because uh	2308	A
like i say my father's eighty and he's really active he still has his driver's license here i mean you wouldn't believe what he does he actually tows cars	2308	A
and as the years got on the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work and-	2308	A
so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two little- dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them you know i've had like	2308	A
over the past thirty years i've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time and there all	2308	A
you know it's like oops dad's got these two and the old one dies and the young one goes for a while and he gets another one so i can't see him without- without his animals even though it's very expensive to stay at home	2308	A
mentally it's just the best thing for you i mean when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have	2308	A
and i'm thinking when i get older i i i think	2308	A
if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home i- i don't want to be a selfish- selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through	2308	A
and i'm and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place	2308	A
i mean and of course it's institutional food and everybody hates it and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight it it's really it's bad thing	2308	A
but when they go into the homes they lose weight and like- because of the institutional food you know i think it's fine but you know	2308	A
my taste um buds are pretty uh flexible and here they are they're always used to these	2308	A
old fashioned foods they're really set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home and now they're feeding them um quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat	2308	A
just they don't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that that's that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really growls about	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
	2308	A
<silence>	2308	A
yeah i know if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the the in-law apartment	2308	A
and have it on you know one floor and really easy access well that's what i'm telling my father now he needs a new floor in his bathroom and i says now is the time redo your whole bathroom so you can get in and out	2308	A
	2308	B
jeez	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yes i'm i'm i have some great concerns about uh my- my parents and my relatives reaching that age	2308	B
um around here where i live in Maryland in the Washington area there's there's and uh i used to live down in Dallas	2308	B
there was just so many stories about uh rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions in fact here in Baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down	2308	B
and taken all the people out of them because they were so uh bug infested and rat infested and it i- you know really concerns me that	2308	B
um first of all that anyone could let someone live like that but if you have to	2308	B
you know how do you make sure i mean i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face	2308	B
um you know how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there	2308	B
you know they may not like the fact that they've been put in there and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there and you know	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yeah	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
uh-huh	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
uh-huh	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yes uh that's true my uh my grandmother's um last time my mother went down there to visit the the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches	2308	B
that uh she even had- you know they went in and she had roaches crawling on her there were roaches even in her alarm clock um	2308	B
yes it was absolutely horrible they took her immediately out of there and they just threw everything away	2308	B
that that she had from there i mean they wouldn't even take the uh the uh the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just you know full of bugs they just left everything	2308	B
and uh bought her all brand new stuff and they they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there	2308	B
and explained to the uh person that was in charge you know what had happened and that they had taking- they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions and amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening and they they put her into that opening	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
 i'm not sure um what exactly is wrong with her um up until nineteen eighty two	2308	B
uh actually i'm sorry not until yeah i guess it was around eighty two eighty three i found out i had a grandmother	2308	B
prior to that i was told that she was dead and um apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who um put her into a mental institution	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
and uh you know it was a real hush hush thing and then i was i was wondering why my mother always referred to you know his second wife as that hussy	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yeah	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yes	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
you know	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yeah	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
uh-huh	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yeah	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
yeah my mother has made similar statements that she doesn't want to become a burden to the family you know just put me out to pasture or shoot me or something you know there are the lines that come from her and uh	2308	B
and i tell her you know no problem mom always got a place for you but uh	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
uh-huh	2308	B
<silence>	2308	B
<silence>	2340	B

it was a lot nicer than i expected	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B

yes we are	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B

isn't that neat	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
uh-huh oh that's good	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
that's neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them_1	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
oh	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right what made you all decide to put her or had- what made her decide to go	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right by herself	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
ah	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
	2340	B
well that's good	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
that's great	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
um-hum	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right shut-ins and	2340	B
yeah it really is i worked at one as a teenager i volunteered at at	2340	B
well it was really it was really sad heartbreaking i guess	2340	B
and uh i just oh i just felt for those people that- especially the ones that never got visited	2340	B
that just bothered me	2340	B
that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age i was probably about fourteen	2340	B
	2340	B
not not really bad of them_1 i mean because_1 they are most of them_1 i- i believe are probably pretty good for the people but	2340	B
i don't know it's just a	2340	B
that would be a tough tough decision	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
helps yeah	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
um-hum	2340	B
um-hum	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
yeah and get that youth back	2340	B
you know sometimes that even helps them you know just being around young people the because_1 some of them_1 are so	2340	B
um you know just stationary i mean they'll get in a wheelchair or they'll just sit in a chair and and till you come along and really try and pump them_1 up they're just	2340	B
stationary and i feel like gosh that's all they do all day long	2340	B
so	2340	B
um so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything i think that's a real real neat idea	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
yeah	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
that's	2340	B
yeah	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
stagnant yeah that's exactly right i think they're really neat um of course i've seen those reports on TV the horrible ones and that scares me	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
	2340	B
it really is it it's sad to think that we would do that to people and you know i've seen them on TV with uh bed sores and	2340	B
uh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry and i just think how can you do that these- these people have have given so much of their lives you know to	2340	B
to America you know or whatever and here is here is how we treat them_1 we just put them_1 in a home and leave them_1	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
um-hum	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
i think it's	2340	B
right i think it's neat i think uh you learn a lot from them_1 you-	2340	B
from all their experiences and and that's one of my favorite things to do sit around and listen to their stories	2340	B
i think that's neat because_1 they really have a lot of good ideas- insights	2340	B
that my father- my husband's father is really old he he had him late in life and he's he'll be eighty this year	2340	B
and i just uh he lives with different	2340	B
you know people in the family he'll switch from time to time i just	2340	B
yeah i just couldn't imagine locking not locking him up but putting him in a home and just	2340	B
	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
oh i know i know	2340	B
right- right right	2340	B
exactly	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
um-hum	2340	B
that's right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
oh you're not going to put me away that's what my mother she always you're going to lock me up one day aren't you i can tell- i can tell you're going to lock me up	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
i know it	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
that's great	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
gosh	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
yes	2340	B
prepare your	2340	B
well that's great can- now can she leave um on a day by herself	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
oh man that's neat	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
yeah	2340	B
	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
i know bless their hearts you hate to hurt them_1 by doing that that's like their one last thing that they can still do and you take away that driving ability and that would really be hard we've	2340	B
uh well we've thought about doing that for for my husband's father because he's	2340	B
yeah	2340	B
	2340	B
	2340	B
 well luckily he drives a big old tank	2340	B
so he i mean i don't think he he could get hurt i just hope to God he doesn't ever hurt anyone but he he hasn't had any accidents luckily	2340	B
yeah yeah	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
i saw that on Twenty Twenty that	2340	B
they um you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that and i think that'd be a great idea because	2340	B
you i think they do come become less aware and	2340	B
they just	2340	B
i don't know they and they don't hear as well for one thing and that doesn't help	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
 no that's	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
right at least that way the burden's not on the family of taking their license or their car away	2340	B
	2340	B
	2340	B
<silence>	2340	B
	2340	A
hello this is Jim in Dallas uh how you doing	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh you're right here okay yeah i'm i'm actually working tonight i just uh called and came in	2340	A
so do you work at TI	2340	A
yeah i just got a little booklet uh this not what we're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and i thought oh i better make some calls	2340	A
 yeah well i haven't get a chance i haven't got a chance to look at them_1 yet	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
my daughter uh got a few calls at home she talked to some student in i guess they give them to computer students too	2340	A
and uh	2340	A
Virginia or something like that she's talked to two students	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh yeah great uh we're supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess uh	2340	A
do you have anybody that you uh have- are close to that decision on or anything or i've thought about it for myself and all and my wife- my wife's mother is uh	2340	A
in a retirement home she's not in a nursing home uh	2340	A
yeah did i did we push	2340	A
let me i'll hit again just in case	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
i did it right as she said yeah	2340	A
but uh she's she's down in San Antonio it's it's a uh	2340	A
it's a brand new one it's a Catholic uh	2340	A
retirement home for nuns it's at uh Trinity no let me see Trinity i keep calling it Trinity- it's not Trinity i'll think of	2340	A
Incarnate Word and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people	2340	A
yeah and that one's really super now i- i know what they're talking about on regular retirement yeah there's not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses	2340	A
and then they have other wings that we visited uh that are very nice i mean it's just super	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh yeah they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks we've been there once at night at Christmas she just went in last year	2340	A
she drives and everything she she's perfectly healthy uh	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
well her husband died they were in the military together and she just did not want to take care of the house	2340	A
and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak and so	2340	A
she's happy as as heck uh and they they have serve meals of course	2340	A
and they have clubs and a swimming pool so that's nice now i	2340	A
i know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one	2340	A
and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick it's a tough question	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh you got experience- more experience than i do then on it	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
um-hum	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and they're getting nicer	2340	A
i've seen on TV where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and and boy that really pumps them up that uh	2340	A
is very nice to see young people i think that's one of the sad things is when you're in an older home	2340	A
if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can't take care of them	2340	A
obvious- obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home but it's nice to have them_1 visit and everything	2340	A
yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
right	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah i think you do get more by stimulation- stimulation my in fact my mother-in-law just visited she's just about seventy five again perfectly fine	2340	A
but one and and she visit us here in in Dallas	2340	A
when she went back every time she goes back to uh San Antonio my wife has two sisters there too she said she's much better she's much more alive and and uh active when she's been on a visit with somebody else you know and	2340	A
and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she's much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that's the fastest way to die i think you know	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh yeah i'm afraid i'm a TV flipper anything bad i like i like to flip i flip it off but it is sad it's sad yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
right when i was uh younger we i lived in the east i'm from the east really	2340	A
and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them_1	2340	A
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she she had her own separate room and i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because_1 i was younger and it's just not a custom anymore	2340	A
to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh right right	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
well that's nice in a lot of ways	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
but that you were you said that by mistake yeah right	2340	A
that's what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i don't want that you know so i- i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than	2340	A
you know it's easy to say well yeah let's let's put these old folks in a home but when i think i don't want to do that you know i don't want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well	2340	A
i'm going to build a little house behind yours and then and i'll take care of your lawn he says but i'm not going to one of those places right yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
	2340	A
that's what we that's the way we call it which is really wrong but my wife's mother and the one she's in San Antonio- it's you know it's everything but the opposite of what you've seen i mean it's uh it's a little hotel- hotel you might say and	2340	A
again a swimming pool and grounds	2340	A
and she has enough room she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area	2340	A
they don't have kitchens or anything but they have little it's like uh	2340	A
on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh yeah it's it's it's nothing like that it's like living in the hotel i mean she's totally on her own	2340	A
uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know	2340	A
and we keep thinking about that you know because_1 she they get less alert and they don't care and i've seen some of these elderly people on TV you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
i know	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
i- i know go ahead i'm sorry	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
oh he still drives	2340	A
that's great- well it's wonderful in one one respect but i don't know if you can afford the insurance yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
right	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
that's good i mean people are all different	2340	A
i- i wonder if they should give them_1 a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them_1 a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years	2340	A
are they doing it	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
yeah	2340	A
well everybody needs retraining it doesn't hurt uh	2340	A
you know best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches and i don't know why you couldn't	2340	A
after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving it would it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know	2340	A
<silence>	2340	A
right there you go there's a good point very good point	2340	A
very good point but i think they need- should do that and then the families will have said	2340	A
	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
well i think i think basically we're in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that	2302	B
for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition	2302	B
but for anything involving that a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory	2302	B
but there should be uh with our	2302	B
overworked	2302	B
uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of	2302	B
of um	2302	B
not having to take everything	2302	B
before a	2302	B
full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh as- as as an example where called a jury duty now	2302	B
and and maybe instead of of uh	2302	B
just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do	2302	B
maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of i don't know twenty five instead of twelve	2302	B
and each- each case is presented to that group of of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude	2302	B
you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor	2302	B
and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time	2302	B
uh i just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
you know we	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
you know kind of deltaing off what what we've been talking about here uh i believe that	2302	B
our we've- we've become almost litigious uh society where we're everyone- everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff	2302	B
and although we're supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that	2302	B
you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone	2302	B
instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you need- you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent	2302	B
need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let	2302	B
either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
you bet and if	2302	B
if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
yes i'd forgotten what that's called there's a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know what- that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society	2302	B
uh to-	2302	B
and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly	2302	B
uh	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
i guess the the Lord started out with we'll treat you fairly- i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say	2302	B
uh that's sort of the Old Testament version	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament but that's a whole different subject	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
okay well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system	2302	B
but it's been a pleasure talking with you	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
i'm living here in Texas	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
well that's quite all right	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
well so am i fact i'm at work out at Lewisville	2302	B
<silence>	2302	B
my pleasure have a good day bye-bye	2302	B
	2302	B
	2302	A
okay uh let's see i i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that	2302	A
there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things	2302	A
and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody	2302	A
i really- i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty	2302	A
theory i think that's	2302	A
that's a good way to do it	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
you know that's about all	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um-hum really	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
	2302	A
right	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
right	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
yeah that's that's a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh	2302	A
you know where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy uh twelve person jury- jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and	2302	A
the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how	2302	A
is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that	2302	A
yeah that's uh that could be a good idea to uh that could work	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
	2302	A
uh-huh	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
yeah right that	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
right that's that's a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them_1 first	2302	A
and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them_1 and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church	2302	A
so that's right off that same kind of principle	2302	A
that's a that's a good idea	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
	2302	A
but uh you know that whole Biblical concept like that that's true in a lot of our um	2302	A
you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't work on that but it's based out of that	2302	A
and uh so that you know that could work there	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um	2302	A
what is that called the Judeo-Christian ethic Judeo-Christian ethic	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
right	2302	A
right right	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
yeah that's	2302	A
	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
really	2302	A
<silence>	2302	A
 really	2302	A

	2302	A
<silence>	2338	A
hi	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
oh me i'm in favor of it	2338	A
yeah i thought i think if uh	2338	A
people like Charles Manson	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
	2338	A
the the heinous crimes uh even if it's one time offense	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah well i know that that- um	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
like they can hold it off for years by uh i'm trying to think of the word that you were um retrials and um	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
i'm forget- i cannot think of that word	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
you have to make sure they're guilty	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
uh-huh	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah- well i think it's all uh i don't think they have uh execution here	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
i i do know though it's easy to get put in jail for life	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
TV station	2338	A
yeah he's they're wanting to record a gas chamber	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes	2338	A
you know	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah i yeah i agree with you there too	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah well i'll agree with you there i don't agree with them showing it on television hard telling who would see it	2338	A
but i i do think that it would scare some people from doing things- you know they'll think about this and say hey i don't think so	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah that's	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
i don't think it's the kind of thing for anybody i know i wouldn't be able to watch it	2338	A
and i'm i'm supposed to be an adult	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah well there's more wrong people that would see it than right people	2338	A
uh you know uh	2338	A
but i i i don't know i think i would	2338	A
	2338	A
say that if they put it where those first time offenders of uh your sex crimes and murderers uh show them what would happen	2338	A
now my aunt had a uh thing when i was younger and uh you know i was working with her	2338	A
and she would say that they should uh	2338	A
for men who did sex crimes they should take off a piece of his body and the most important part to a man and inch by inch	2338	A
	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
that would stop them from wanting to	2338	A
no well i thought it was funny listening to her she's just a she's she's a little bit uh dingy when it comes to things but well she's vicious	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
	2338	A
yeah like that Lionel something or another that black boy of they had a television program about him two hour movie	2338	A
can't think of his name	2338	A
but he spent quite a few- few quite a while in jail	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
 well you see that on television also	2338	A
	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah that's a problem with capital punishment though but- when you got people that you know uh for some reason or another Charles Manson sticks in my brain	2338	A
i seen him on an interview talking about how if he ever got out how many people he was going to kill	2338	A
and uh	2338	A
that's a man that should be put to death	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
that's more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
i uh i don't think anyone would miss him either	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
well as you can tell my two decided to come in here uh	2338	A
what	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
i'm in Denison	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah i got some guy from San Francisco one night	2338	A
uh no you is talking about Saddam Hussein	2338	A
i think it would be wrong for us to kill him for the Americans to kill him	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
i think the	2338	A
now if one of the Kurds uh i'm sure you know who they are	2338	A
if they went in and got him he wouldn't be a what's the word martyr martyr martyr martyr	2338	A
i could see the word in my head i just couldn't pronounce it	2338	A
uh but if we did it oh man	2338	A
they'd have him up on a pedestal	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah that's what my husband keeps telling me see how you know um i'm just now getting into the world politics and all that	2338	A
uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something	2338	A
uh but uh	2338	A
yeah well it's getting easier to understand though you know plus my husband he was in the Navy for ten years so he uh when it comes to the military he kind of knows what he's talking about	2338	A
i don't put every a hundred percent stock into what he says but	2338	A
i'll listen and agree with what i think sounds right	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
yeah well i think they uh	2338	A
the people there will take care of him now	2338	A
<silence>	2338	A
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
you are	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things	2338	B
we had to pick a topic to to investigate	2338	B
and uh at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more common	2338	B
and if you tended- and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter	2338	B
the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well	2338	B
i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um	2338	B
	2338	B
you know sense about you then even if you did the exact same crime chances are you wouldn't get you'd get life instead of the death penalty as a opposed to somebody who couldn't communicate well	2338	B
and at that time it just seemed so fair- unfair	2338	B
that um i i felt like i couldn't uh um	2338	B
you know i just didn't agree with it	2338	B
it's gotten so though that there are so many	2338	B
you know there are so many uh	2338	B
	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right uh i know what you're saying um	2338	B
but yeah they there's you know there's always uh uh you know and and in a way you know i guess that's good i mean if you're going to if you're going to kill somebody	2338	B
right yeah you know give them give them i mean you should give somebody every every chance even even if it seems obvious	2338	B
um i don't know what the what the law is like in Texas i mean i certainly haven't heard anything- any anything about somebody being executed or anything	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
i don't i don't either	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
well you know the um there was something on TV last night about how one state what there was a newspaper in no it was a TV station	2338	B
you- did you see that	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
i thought that was disgusting i mean	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
and that's what that's what really bothers me you know i'm all for deterrents	2338	B
but i i think what's going to happen is it's going to turn it into a circus	2338	B
and	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
no	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
sure	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
	2338	B
you know what what you know what might happen but the- you know for TV station- you know that TV station isn't going to want to restrict how they use it	2338	B
and they're going to show it on the six o'clock- well probably not the six o'clock news but they'll show it on the eleven o'clock eleven o'clock news	2338	B
and i don't you know i've got a ten year old and	2338	B
you know she's she could very well be up at that time	2338	B
you know when we're and that's just not the kind of thing for a ten year old i'm not sure it's the kind of thing for a sixteen year old	2338	B
right	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right and in fact i think it'd be harmful if my if you know if my daughter or my any of my kids saw it	2338	B
so that has to be brought into the picture too	2338	B
you know you just can't blatantly say let's let's show it and and the the right people will see it and it'll deter them from committing a crime all lot of the wrong people are going to see it too and uh	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah yeah	2338	B
	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah my wife says that all the time	2338	B
yeah well that that would certainly do it	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
	2338	B
yeah well you know i i think that if if i felt like the the the system was was truly fair and and uh and that they would never make a mistake then	2338	B
you know but you hear you know you hear about people who are who are genuinely uh mistakenly accused of a crime and	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
i can't i can't think either-	2338	B
yeah right	2338	B
that's right and and it turns out he didn't do it	2338	B
or you know and and it's easy you know and and you know let's face it not all policemen are honest and	2338	B
that's right	2338	B
and and you know they can they'll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and and then it's and they're under pressure to to solve a crime	2338	B
and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn't do it and especially if it's you know somebody who's mentally retarded who can't defend themselves very well	2338	B
and i'd hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn't them	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah yeah well he was a	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah sheesh	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
and uh it it it just doesn't seem right that our tax money or somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive	2338	B
you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right right that's right and he's probably living a lot better than some people who deserve a lot more	2338	B
and uh that does you know that does sort of you know but how you know it's just so hard it's just so hard to to be fair and uh	2338	B
yeah i guess i wouldn't i wouldn't mind if if all of a sudden he didn't exist any more uh	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
no no uh i you know i i think the same thing about people like Saddam Hussein	2338	B
you know you know the- jeez you know they're just they're just the scum of the earth	2338	B
and uh i just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support somebody like that	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
	2338	B
now where where where area where are you from	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
Denison oh okay	2338	B
and every so often you get somebody who's in in uh California or or New York something-	2338	B
yeah yeah	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
i think you're right i don't think we're i think we're we'd we'd overstep our bounds if we went in and did that	2338	B
though it's awfully tempting	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yep	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
martyr	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
oh yeah the whole	2338	B
well right now we're in a delicate situation because we've got this	2338	B
we've- for the first time we're sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
oh sure	2338	B
it's complicated	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
oh	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
	2338	B
right	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
right	2338	B
yeah there and you know it's a he's got that delicate balance right there and we'd just be overstepping our bounds i think if we walked in and sort of took over	2338	B
<silence>	2338	B
yeah i just can't imagine that they'd let him rule any longer you know if if they had you know if they could do something about it	2338	B
i mean his own army is going to eventually turn on him because and and you see- this has happened before in history you know that it just gets to a certain point where you're just not willing	2338	B
	2311	A
this is like one of the worst topics i've had because i'm a terrible dresser	2311	A
i'm really not that bad of a dresser but um where i work um it's very casual dressing	2311	A
so i can wear jeans and um pretty much a sweater or even a T-shirt to work it- it-	2311	A
yeah well we i work in a manufacturing plant so we don't i don't have to deal with customers or anything but-	2311	A
no actually i'm at work right now i work at night and i'm using this phone as one of my you have to have two phones i'm using one of these	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah well i sit here i'm taking a course and i study when i study- when i uh read my course while i'm trying to get through so i'm just make a couple a night though	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
oh you see that's i almost wish i had a job like that so it would force me to dress nice	2311	A
yeah because i can slough off and then when it comes things out or or i go out to dinner or something or or not not so much going out to dinner i have like three or four dresses that i can wear something like- business interview	2311	A
	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah well- and it's it's really convenient we're twins too so it works out	2311	A
yeah she just had to change her whole wardrobe because she's going up like a management ladder and even though she still has to work i mean do some lot of physical work and adjust her machines	2311	A
um she still has to dress for success as they say	2311	A
so she went out and she changed her whole her whole wardrobe	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
that's true yep	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
i know because you know even like i ironed a shirt to come to work tonight you know just a nice blouse and if i was going to wear it with a suit or something i would have had done a a ten times better job	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah and it's- it's got to be more expensive	2311	A
 yep but that's what's you have when when you have to deal with the public or deal with the customers they like that that business suit- suit	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
 right	2311	A
	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
do	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
boots	2311	A
do you have to do you find that you you can are- are you happy with wearing dress slacks instead of dresses because_1 i know a lot of people who dress it's usually dresses dresses they hardly- hardly don't wear dress pants or anything	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
see all the girls that i know i know a couple girls that work in insurance offices and that's all they they wear are dresses they hardly ever wear pants then on the weekends you know they wear their jeans and their sweats	2311	A
but they- they uh the pants just aren't dressy enough but in the wintertime i think i would be wearing pants	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah- yeah	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
yeah even even here the secretaries they usually dress nice but it's not strange to seem them in jeans and a sweater	2311	A
so and you know sometimes it is on Fridays but in the summertime if they're going to like i know a couple of the girls and this one lady goes camping a lot and like every Friday she's she's- you know she still does her same function and everything	2311	A
but uh normally she's dressed to the T she's just perfect	2311	A
yeah well we're fortunate here because_1 the building's um very um climate controlled	2311	A
but we work in an electronics field and we have to wear polyester smocks so it's usually um a tank top in the Summer and then silk and polyester are the only things that are close enough to being dressy	2311	A
and they and polyester's terrible on me and i wear my silk under this polyester uh smock and you just get so hot even though it's a nice temperature in here so you really in the summertime have to	2311	A
we have to dress extra light because we have to wear these smocks	2311	A
yeah and in the wintertime pretty much just uh um even a turtleneck's all right because you have to wear these smocks a turtleneck and a sweater and the smock would be too much it it gets really hot	2311	A
so it's kind of weird when it's really cold we- we come in pretty much we have- take our coat off and then we take our outside sweater off	2311	A
trucking through the parking lot	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
but they still they have to keep the pants really just	2311	A
but	2311	A
yeah and their shirts have to be pressed so they still have the same thing where if they could dress casually it would take them less time too	2311	A
but i know what it's like i mean just putting on a pair of panty hose can take you an extra five minutes	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
oh i know um even my dress shoes i don't wear them_1 a lot i notice the wear on the bottom of them	2311	A
and there's no way i could wear them all day i would be the one of the women in flats	2311	A
well i'm pretty short but i have a very bad knee i couldn't	2311	A
couldn't walk in heels all day when i go dancing i i- i going out i'm like i- i stand the ball on my foot hoping i don't slip on my heel because if my if i stand- if i jam down on my heel too much my knee doesn't catch and	2311	A
it's bad well it's	2311	A
no we don't at all um we used to be a lot busier so um we it used to be important what you wore if you're comfortable because_1 you knew you were going to spend a lot of time working	2311	A
and now it's very slow and i pretty much i've taken a couple courses and now- now i sit at my desk and i and i read read my courses	2311	A
i'm a technician so i've taken a couple technical courses plus i go take a couple college courses like- i've taken um some business courses	2311	A
just uh it's gets boring to stay here technical courses learning about power supplies in computers and yeah	2311	A
yeah this	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
okay	2311	A
okay so it do you think it's been five minutes see i never time these	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
oh okay so we can end our call okay	2311	A
<silence>	2311	A
yeah oh who knows did- did you have you ever gotten duplicate people	2311	A
no i you- i'm almost afraid to get duplicate people i don't know why	2311	A
okay well	2311	A
yeah okay okay_1 bye yeah you too	2311	A
	2311	A
	2311	B

oh okay well that's good well i um i work actually in a different sort of environment i work in a uh personnel agency a temporary agency	2311	B
and so for me i'm always out with customers or with uh employees and i practically have to wear a suit everyday	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
oh really well uh	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B

<silence>	2311	B
um-hum um-hum	2311	B
	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
um-hum the the thing that kills me is that we have dress down days sometimes at work you know where can throw on jeans and i swear i can sleep an extra half an hour	2311	B
if i don't have to get up and put on panty hose and fix the skirt and button shirts and you-	2311	B
you know i i just i love it when i can get up and throw on sweats or just throw on jeans and tie sneakers and and i'm fine	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
right plus ironing the suit on top of that you know	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B

<silence>	2311	B
yep exactly	2311	B
	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B

and i don't even care how i look i mean i i'll have	2311	B
	2311	B
and so um i i mean i don't even touch shoes- shoes when i'm outdoors i just wear boots and like two pairs of socks and	2311	B

<silence>	2311	B
yep	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B

and take them off because it really really does get cold but um	2311	B
i would love a job where i didn't it it wouldn't be casual all the time but i didn't have to be dressy all the time and i could wear more fun clothes	2311	B

<silence>	2311	B
um-hum i know	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
yeah i know	2311	B
oh geez well you know it doesn't seem fair for because guys i mean i feel like all they have to do is change a tie	2311	B
and they've got a whole new outfit	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
well that's true	2311	B
yeah they have to keep looking sort of clean and pressed	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
that's true	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
i know and then you know if you run one forget it you not only lose- you know spend another four bucks but	2311	B
you know take that extra time and i mean another thing that kills me is i walk in heels all day and i wear out the bottom of my shoes so quickly on the pavement and and i'm spending like you know	2311	B
instead of buying new shoes i'm always repairing them and again that's like four dollars each time to bring in a pair of shoes and get new heels put on	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
um-hum the the nails start showing through and that sort of thing	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
 oh well i'm too short to wear flats if i wore	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
oh	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
uh-huh	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
oh jeez oh it must be painful yeah	2311	B
do you stand all day at your job or you	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
um-hum that's great	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B

um-hum	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
good for you	2311	B
that's great	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
well i'll be thinking of you dressing casually at night when i go to work	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
oh yeah it's i- i was timing it because_1 i came in uh it's been about seven minutes	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
okay_1	2311	B
yeah well Linda take care it was really nice talking to you	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
no have you	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
oh	2311	B
that would be fun though	2311	B
just- pick up where you left off	2311	B
 {alrighty}	2311	B
take care bye-bye	2311	B
<silence>	2311	B
	2311	B
	2366	B
i don't know i grew up uh in the the sixties and at that time	2366	B
uh it was uh a changing time for the whole music scene i guess and i grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and	2366	B
kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and and thereafter but have since	2366	B
uh since i grew up in a small town in in southern Oklahoma i have kind of gone back to uh more of a county uh flavor in music um	2366	B
i'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a an opposite but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pop	2366	B
uh sounding music it didn't have what you know i guess what i was looking for at the time country tells more of a a story it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and i've i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah that was my teenage years i was born in fifty and and uh	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
that's kind of the way i am	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
it is it's got uh basically an easy uh rhythm and and tone	2366	B
and it's it's pretty fairly well easily to uh uh something to fall into i'm kind of the say way i i've gone through different periods of life uh in music	2366	B
from from pop to classical i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i've worked in radio stations as a DJ for all my college years trying to support my way through there and support- was support was uh	2366	B
influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked and i've developed a real love for uh classical music in	2366	B
probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was uh heavy into classical type music he said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music	2366	B
uh that they were using behind them because they used especially Disney used a lot of classical music	2366	B
behind the cartoons and so consequently we wind up wound up playing a lot of classical music there and i think that uh got deep seated into me one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is	2366	B
uh are those that call on those classical uh	2366	B
roots i guess uh Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's there's not a whole lot of his stuff that i'm real crazy about but he does have some things Chicago had some things	2366	B
uh and i think even Electric Light Orchestra had some	2366	B
some real um	2366	B
influences by classical music and	2366	B
i'm still still my favorite in fact most of my CDs that i got are classical music	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
i'm kind of thinking that that's maybe our generation was	2366	B
uh so in tuned to music	2366	B
of that time that we identify	2366	B
goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that's behinds them	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
uh-huh	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
right	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
 yeah that's their signal	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
did when did you first take your uh your first piano lesson	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
it is a time consumer	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
yeah	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
right	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
no it's making that uh that connection especially with the mechanical	2366	B
parts of it i was never able to to master all that in fact my brother and sister both they were oh thirteen sixteen years older than i they went through the uh	2366	B
parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing	2366	B
and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again they sold the piano and is the turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to so i that's one of things i felt like i missed in life and i i really in fact uh	2366	B
one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin that is played on uh piano i just	2366	B
you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that	2366	B
maybe one of these days i'll you know i'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i'll get around to it i'll do something with the piano but probably not	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
just never got a chance to come out no	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
well it's a pleasure talking with you	2366	B
best of luck in your graduate school	2366	B
good-bye	2366	B
<silence>	2366	B
	2366	B
<silence>	2366	A
when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years or uh	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
okay	2366	A
we we're very similarly aged so we probably have an interesting- an interesting perspective on the music on the times so i'm just a couple years older than you uh	2366	A
essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that i for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me	2366	A
uh	2366	A
my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel whom i saw perform when i was in college and i became attached to that style of uh	2366	A
urban urban country if there is such a thing i think with	2366	A
uh in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend uh to have a dramatic or story approach to their music uh usually tend to have some sort of good or bad moral to it	2366	A
uh	2366	A
over time i became very interested in in baroque classical and i think that was just through	2366	A
experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat	2366	A
uh Simon	2366	A
it's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred	2366	A
music i'm not a not a music um i'm not particularly schooled in it i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music	2366	A
and i	2366	A
i spent a good deal of time listening also to uh	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
people from the late seventies really um Neil Diamond for instance	2366	A
Um	2366	A
people of of that particular time i	2366	A
listen to some country and western but i'm not school-	2366	A
schooled in it and i i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it i played a little bit of piano i've i continue to think that i want to do it and i never have the discipline to stay with it	2366	A
but when i do play	2366	A
uh and and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
right	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
right	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music i don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation	2366	A
uh a good example would be uh i have connections but but uh not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations	2366	A
uh	2366	A
and i found that i really like China Beach and i particularly like Tour of Duty and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows	2366	A
uh and and i've uh Thirty Something i'm particularly interested but it's the music almost that i find myself listening to	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
that could well be i i uh	2366	A
spent my junior year uh	2366	A
and sophomore and junior year in in college when i a song by the uh	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
uh i think the title of it was just Downtown	2366	A
uh and if you recall how it goes downtown {da} {dah} {dah} {dah}	2366	A
uh all i have to do is hear that song	2366	A
and i get you strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in school being behind on work	2366	A
uh and	2366	A
my family now knows if they come into my study and uh	2366	A
i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done uh at school	2366	A
uh	2366	A
and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away	2366	A
	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it that's right	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
uh probably about first grade	2366	A
and i have uh returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to to do something about it	2366	A
i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes and then inevitably i am swept away by the	2366	A
the pressure of other types of things uh	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
it is in order to continue to to grow and i	2366	A
i always think that i'll be able to do it and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what it is that other people take for granted	2366	A
in composition themes and i keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved	2366	A
uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but it doesn't for me	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
uh-huh	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
oh	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance uh	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
that's the most fascinating thing	2366	A
and you sir you take care	2366	A
okay bye-bye	2366	A
<silence>	2366	A
	2366	A
<silence>	2332	A
hi how you doing	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
do you do you have uh drug testing where you are	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
uh yeah i have uh what i've found out out of curiosity was my name has uh has come up twice and we've only been involved with the program say about a year	2332	A
and uh when i when i first heard about it i was very uh very defensive i didn't think it was something that that the companies ought to be doing	2332	A
because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah but now um now that it's happening i	2332	A
i feel comfortable with it i- i don't feel as though i've lost anything and that i feel uh secure in that i know that everybody that works	2332	A
around me um	2332	A
is is drug free	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
how how about_1 how about_1 where you-	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
um-hum	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
well i was involved in uh in the in the initial training program because i had to go out and teach or explain to other people	2332	A
what we were doing why we were doing it so i- i guess i had a little uh uh first hand knowledge of	2332	A
of uh seeing the films i had more of extensive training in in uh background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that uh	2332	A
uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
oh yeah	2332	A
how do you feel about other- other uh things like public uh safety buses bus drivers and and uh airplane drivers or or	2332	A
pilots rather	2332	A
you	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
well i	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
um	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah the the uh i've always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested i've i have- never said that i didn't want that the problem that i had was	2332	A
whether my coworker is on drugs or not has does not have an influence on my safe well-being	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
no so i had uh	2332	A
right	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
well i'm sure that's still going to happen	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
	2332	A
uh smokers typically have more time out of work they're uh uh more prone to accidents and all of those other things and and uh	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
for for automobile insurance i had no idea	2332	A
that they were doing that i know that they originally talking about uh health	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
you're not as attentive	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
um	2332	A
uh that's uh that's different i've never heard of that how about the um	2332	A
the the smoking premium	2332	A
out in Texas i understand they they started doing that	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
June July	2332	A
yeah that they from what i understand that uh notices went out to all of the sites	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
well that's that's the problem that's you don't uh how about_1 uh do you eat- do you like French fries	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
 what- what would you what would you ever say if they said anybody who eats French fries has to pay a ten percent premium on their life insurance	2332	A
uh then you would get upset it's it's uh what they're doing is they're nibbling at the population piece by piece	2332	A
and uh and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is is less than the the uh the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that um	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
preventable death not yeah but	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah but isn't isn't the uh the insurance also for for uh Blue Cross	2332	A
so they're not only saying preventable- not preventable death they're also saying um	2332	A
that you'll have uh less likelihood of being sick if you don't smoke	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
	2332	A
is he an older person	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
well that	2332	A
that's not too old	2332	A
	2332	A
yeah and he and he does miss a lot of work	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
well	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
what- what do you mean if they can prove it there there's already	2332	A
hardening of the arteries it's it's uh sure it is high cholesterol	2332	A
	2332	A
see- see one of the things that will determine whether they're able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that French fries are not healthy for you it's the capability- it's the capability of detecting it	2332	A
how do you prove someone has eaten French fries	2332	A
	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
um but i think in time come you're going to see that happening you're going to see um where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
yeah yeah	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
uh	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
but yeah but there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it	2332	A
and and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that there's a big difference so that so that they really can't make a a change in in policy about drinking until	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
 yeah- yeah right right yeah	2332	A
so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion um where it's not something- i don't think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think they're doing it involuntarily	2332	A
i know i am um i don't know anybody in their right mind that says that that i'm doing it because i want to i	2332	A
well i- i- i do i do make that statement i say i do it because_1 i like it but i can't say i'm i'm i'm doing it because_1 i want to i'm doing it because_1 i have to uh or because- my desire is greater than uh	2332	A
	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
start up again	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
i uh i started when i was younger and uh	2332	A
it was prior to the time that the the risks were uh were known	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
okay nice talking to you	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
 and you've got that Southern accent	2332	A
	2332	A
i'm in the Attleboro-	2332	A
Attleboro Massachusetts plant	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
<silence>	2332	A
oh no kidding	2332	A
<silence>	2332	B
good	2332	B
	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
yes yes we do right here at the at the very building they have uh a nurse's office	2332	B
and uh i haven't	2332	B
my name hasn't come up yet how about_1 you	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
yes that's the the major issue i guess that uh	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
i have a a similar opinion at first i	2332	B
wasn't sure	2332	B
but	2332	B
then	2332	B
i thought it was a good thing for the company as as well	2332	B
uh uh we had a couple of people in our group who wrote- one who wrote a huge letter to the editors	2332	B
saying that it's a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests aren't accurate and	2332	B
but i think they've got that testing down to a real science where you know they don't really- you know	2332	B
i'm i'm sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it it's almost impossible i think to uh	2332	B
to make a mistake	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
who were uh	2332	B
right and that and that's a lot of money	2332	B
and	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
oh oh taking drug testing	2332	B
oh sure i think that's that's	2332	B
i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights	2332	B
to secure the rights of others i guess is what i'm saying	2332	B
uh when the public whole ah is at stake	2332	B
then i'm willing to give- you know personally i can't speak for others but for myself i'm willing to say okay you know	2332	B
if i see this is a right to if to privacy i'm willing to give up that right	2332	B
because i can see that it's uh	2332	B
public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and	2332	B
you know if they can get this thing under control you know it it's going to save us all money	2332	B
as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and and and and everything else in this country	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right you don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery or or things like that but	2332	B
and um they don't have any of that up here but you know um	2332	B
i guess it's just the productivity	2332	B
and the the number of uh uh sick days i guess	2332	B
and that they uh	2332	B
that they accrue	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right well well i- i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work	2332	B
and then i guess that's why this smoking thing came out too	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
when they're drive- and that's why why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
oh yeah	2332	B
they	2332	B
nonsmoker-	2332	B
at least down here in Texas they have nonsmoker-	2332	B
nonsmoker they call them_1 discounts	2332	B
they give you if you're a nonsmoker i- i guess there is some kind of studies that show	2332	B
but if you're smoking	2332	B
you're not you're not as you know when you're lighting up or something you know your hands both hands aren't on the wheel or whatever	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
that's yeah i guess that takes effect in uh	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
when June July yeah	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right there was a lot of uh controversy about that too i'm not a i'm not a smoker myself	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
i do	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
yeah i'd probably get upset	2332	B
yeah yeah	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right if they i- i- i assume if they they	2332	B
i guess they're saying with the cigarettes though that they've been able to show that it's the number one	2332	B
leading cause of preventable	2332	B
preventable	2332	B
death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right right right right well that's all what i always felt if it if those studies were true about smokers having higher medical costs	2332	B
and we do have one smoker in our area who and he	2332	B
he seems to miss a lot of work	2332	B
but um	2332	B
um forty	2332	B
eight maybe	2332	B
yeah forty five forty eight	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
yeah but then there's people you talk to and say i've never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the the studies show as an average	2332	B
not specific cases and uh	2332	B
i thought well with you know if that's really true then	2332	B
then i guess i agreed with the extra premium	2332	B
if it could- i mean if they can come along and prove that French fries	2332	B
were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess	2332	B
yeah that that it's a major cause of uh early	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
well it depends if they're cooked in	2332	B
	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right it it's the it's the honor system isn't it	2332	B
it's the honor system i know it'll be an interesting experiment to see how	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
right well well i think the same way with alcohol too	2332	B
personally it you know that that would probably be the next	2332	B
the next thing	2332	B
i mean	2332	B
but you know there's- there's the difference because_1 uh they say you know	2332	B
i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
oh yeah that's	2332	B
there is oh there is	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
yeah well it's part of the business world too when you make	2332	B
deals you know a lot of times it's uh	2332	B
three martini lunch or whatever they say	2332	B
	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
makes me feel better	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
right	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
the nicotine addiction yeah	2332	B
yeah i have uh my in-laws are both smokers and uh they've tried to quit	2332	B
numerous times and	2332	B
and i think the longest they've made it is about three months and then they go to a a friend's house or something and there they're all smoking and	2332	B
and they break yeah they just can't stand it you know all of a sudden they get it's overwhelming and then they break down and then they say i'm a failure and then they just give up you know	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
were known yeah	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
so	2332	B
well i think we've probably talked long enough	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
well i can tell you're from you've got that New England accent	2332	B
<silence>	2332	B
does that mean you're you're you're in uh uh New Hampshire- what-	2332	B
Massachusetts	2332	B
yeah i have uh	2332	B
my wife's uh grandparents are from Boston they're	2332	B
	2355	B
okay	2355	B
the war you mean in terms of the economy or	2355	B
	2355	B
oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes	2355	B
is that is that what you're kind of directing it oh okay okay well um	2355	B
well i think it's caused a lot of you know	2355	B
big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that	2355	B
you know and support the soldiers so	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah it would be like a bonus for your image or something	2355	B
yeah it i'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income	2355	B
just drastically altered we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and	2355	B
i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah i think the biggest change that we've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years and you know	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
going to effect too many	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
so that's the hardest thing for us and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can	2355	B
	2355	B
you know so that's a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
oh i see	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
uh-huh	2355	B
yeah yeah well it	2355	B
	2355	B
yeah you have an inside track or something	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
let's see what other social changes in the past ten years oh i guess between men and women i've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson	2355	B
	2355	B
yeah because_1 i know you know i i really get pressure from because_1 i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home	2355	B
you know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work	2355	B
so that's kind of a difference for us i think there's more pressure to um	2355	B
not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family	2355	B
so he's	2355	B
yeah he's gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up	2355	B
so it's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah that's true mister mom and	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
uh-huh	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
that's true	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah i think there's still i i know that um i grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think there's a lot of um	2355	B
kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and	2355	B
you know i think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now	2355	B
you know i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
but there's so many more people that are homeless and yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because when- when i was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all	2355	B
first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything and now we're kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know	2355	B
	2355	B
oh boy	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
	2355	B
oh	2355	B
	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah and that they	2355	B
	2355	B
we lived in a dorm my husband and i met in graduate school at Indiana University and i was ours was uh international coed- you know coed dorm and there were twelve hundred students they're graduate students from all over the world	2355	B
and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that because it really is exciting to be around people of different	2355	B
	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
oh uh-huh	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
oh	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
oh gosh	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
that is part of the change i think that i've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now	2355	B
kids have to have so much i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas i mean	2355	B
people have- you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
oh yeah it's just	2355	B
	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
oh gosh	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
oh	2355	B
	2355	B
	2355	B
yeah no kidding	2355	B
<silence>	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
well	2355	B
did we cover it everything	2355	B
 okay i guess i'll get back to my laundry	2355	B
	2355	B
you too good luck bye-bye	2355	B
	2355	B
	2355	A
okay um what do you think about the war recently	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
uh	2355	A
the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
yeah yeah	2355	A
that's the first thing i thought of i don't know	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
right	2355	A
right	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
right and	2355	A
i know that uh i've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two	2355	A
you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam	2355	A
that was totally different you know you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably	2355	A
and now if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
exactly-	2355	A
exactly exactly	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
oh torn apart oh yeah	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
um-hum	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
right	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
so it that's also a good reason why it it or good that it ended as soon as it did	2355	A
oh okay	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
um-hum	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes	2355	A
um uh stamps i mean it seems like ever exactly everything single thing that we do	2355	A
is higher you know	2355	A
and they just raised the minimum wage today but that's not like you know	2355	A
as much as they should have raised it i'm sure	2355	A
but uh	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
right	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
right right	2355	A
uh-huh yeah	2355	A
i don't i don't have any children or anything right now i'm uh i work as a	2355	A
news reporter in Waco and so i get to see i got to see a lot of not firsthand but	2355	A
uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so	2355	A
it was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me	2355	A
you know what's going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something	2355	A
yeah yeah so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything	2355	A
so that was pretty interesting	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
yeah	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
exactly be everything be supermom exactly	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
right and	2355	A
where as it would have been exactly um	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
right the roles are changing a lot	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
right	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now	2355	A
kind of kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have The Three Men and a Baby type movies	2355	A
and i think you know to yeah and then you have the women	2355	A
uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now	2355	A
you know since the women's movement in the well- seventies and you know we've come a long way but i think it's still a still good ways to go	2355	A
so	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
right	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
yeah	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
exactly	2355	A
exactly	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
it's just not as	2355	A
exactly but it's i mean like i say we've come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still	2355	A
and i don't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people	2355	A
you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you	2355	A
but there's so many more people exactly that you don't even and that you don't even see or know about	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
oh oh yeah	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
 yeah	2355	A
yeah	2355	A
i grew up in in Brooklyn New York and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people because i'm Black and so you know i lived that's where i lived	2355	A
and so now i i feel lucky actually because i've almost lived around everyone i've i went to UT to college and so they you know they have	2355	A
a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and so they don't get to see	2355	A
 exactly and that	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
 exactly	2355	A
it is	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
oh my gosh	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
well there's so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that so that's great my sister was telling me	2355	A
she met a girl- she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um i think	2355	A
Barbados or Jamaica or something like that	2355	A
and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars so my sister had to take her shopping and	2355	A
you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness	2355	A
you know this girl just coming to America type thing you know so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that	2355	A
but	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
oh yeah	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
they think they have to have everything they have to have the latest cereal about you know just	2355	A
yeah that's ridiculous too when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school	2355	A
you know and i couldn't and i just couldn't	2355	A
believe you know i was from New York and so you know we rode the bus and if you had a car- yeah	2355	A
 exactly and if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway or you know it's just	2355	A
you just didn't have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and i couldn't understand it you know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car	2355	A
so that was	2355	A
 yeah yeah right-	2355	A
really or live really close to school and have them walk	2355	A
but uh yeah a lot of changes	2355	A
so	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
i think so	2355	A
<silence>	2355	A
okay well it's good it's good talking to you okay bye-bye	2355	A

all the things it came with for the price i couldn't beat it	2326	B
<silence>	2326	B
uh i didn't really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars	2326	B
just not holding up so	2326	B
uh my last car was a foreign foreign made car and it held up real well and the car before that was American and it fell apart so	2326	B
i just decided to go foreign	2326	B
<silence>	2326	B
really	2326	B
<silence>	2326	B
really	2326	B
<silence>	2326	B
hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go American because everybody know has got a American made truck	2326	B
they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart	2326	B
<silence>	2326	B
get out there and test drive	2326	B
<silence>	2326	B
yeah	2326	B

it didn't last eighteen months i had had more trouble with that	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A
yeah i that's that's probably true i'm getting ready to i think i'm going to trade off the super cab and i'm considering going with either one of those four door S10 Blazers a four door Explorer or four door Jeep	2326	A
but i can't decide which one	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A
yeah that's about the only thing to do i'm just i i'm looking for uh fuel economy and and durability and i've got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot	2326	A
but i don't need to haul a pickup as much haul around stuff in the pickup as much as i used to we got an old one there at the ranch we use now	2326	A
but i just got to have something i can get out in the field and of course that truck is only getting like eight to ten miles a gallon maybe twelve on a good day and that just kills me	2326	A
especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A
well those small ones uh those little bitty ones i'm going to go with the small one with the two wheel drive i don't really i i haven't had a use for four wheel drive tell you the truth	2326	A
they say they're getting eighteen to twenty in them_1 yeah i've got a friend of mine's got a uh he bought a four door Jeep with the {positrack} rear end instead of the four wheel drive	2326	A
he's getting sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty two on the road	2326	A
no he's not really and he's not he said he's pretty heavy footed he's clipping along at sixty five or so around there when he can get away with it	2326	A
so i think i could probably stand you know twice the gas mileage	2326	A
it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit i just don't know if i could stand one that small because i'm fairly large and i've always driven a truck or something	2326	A
i don't know	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A
they don't look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just don't know if i could stand you know being cooped up my wife's got uh three old cars of hers she's never sold a car she's bought	2326	A
she has thirty nine Chevy a fifty three and a sixty seven	2326	A
and anytime i drive any of those i just you know it's like being in a coffin i just feel hemmed in i've got to have something fairly large	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A
but i think probably- probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability	2326	A
you know the little those smaller trucks	2326	A
yeah i know that's	2326	A
i think it would be fun if you didn't have to pay for the repairs to it	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A
but that's what they don't show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they don't show you the repairs	2326	A
you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine	2326	A
last time i lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A
so i don't know	2326	A
<silence>	2326	A

 yeah	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh yeah i do i guess i like that one	2356	B
yeah that's about i you know i don't like too much TV you know i do have a few of my favorites so	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
yeah well my- we my husband- kids like to watch you know uh	2356	B
 Sesame Street sometimes but they they're in more into watching their own videos you know	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
 uh-huh	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh yeah that's what my kids do they have Bambi Little Mermaid you know all Peter Pan all those and then i check some out from the library you know	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
yeah	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh yeah so that's what they like to do so we seem to watch more videos for the kids and then my husband's a TV watcher he's a sports nut though	2356	B
yeah	2356	B
 yeah see my husband's one of these that will switch from game to game to catch a little bit of every one you know	2356	B
	2356	B
	2356	B
oh not him he'll watch a little bit of everything so	2356	B
	2356	B
i'm one that likes to sit and watch one show	2356	B
so	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
oh yeah	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
 well that's one nice thing about remote you know not having a remote you don't have to worry about	2356	B
your husband switching- switching the channels so	2356	B
 but yeah that's my about my favorite so	2356	B
	2356	B
well it's been nice talking to you it's nice to talk to somebody in Texas for once	2356	B
	2356	B
	2356	B
oh Rochester North Carolina all over so	2356	B
<silence>	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
 yeah it's it's unusual so	2356	B
okay	2356	B
you too nice talking to you bye-bye	2356	B
	2356	B
<silence>	2335	B
so what do you think	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
yep	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
what about	2335	B
i agree with the upper and lower level you know	2335	B
because that's the lowest thing for themselves plus there's nobody for them to look up to	2335	B
but i also blame some of it on parents	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
because parents aren't parents	2335	B
because_1 i remember even when i was growing up	2335	B
 i'm thirty five i remember when i was growing up and i had friends	2335	B
that used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff my mother warned us it's like i don't care what your friends do	2335	B
if you do it then that was it i mean i knew that i would get mean- more trouble from my mother than from	2335	B
from anybody else and i think that's the basic is they have no morals anymore so they don't care	2335	B
so	2335	B
but now as far as what they can do about it i don't know	2335	B
you can't make parents be parents	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
you know	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
i guess if you gave the gave them_1 jobs that- that's another problem with the United States there's no jobs anymore	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
but	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
that'll work to a point	2335	B
well that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway i don't care what you do to them_1	2335	B
you know so i think it depends on how much trouble that kids has been in	2335	B
you know	2335	B
because uh a child can get into anything regardless- i don't care who how good you- -they are	2335	B
eventually- at least one time but now if it's a repeated thing here with this child in juvenile and all this- to me yeah both of them_1 because_1 that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do	2335	B
because_1 i just watched it on TV one night on one of them um Twenty Twenty Forty Eight Hours one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars	2335	B
i don't know if you seen they was the gang- a little it was a little gang of them_1 stealing cars you know and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there now they're gonna take me away from you that means she was warned	2335	B
but see by that i think that- sometimes it a little late	2335	B
you know but i'm sure there's something can be done	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
yeah start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
well they should start with the the- if they would get rid of seems to me i know there's a lot about courts that people don't understand there's more people in jail right now for child support	2335	B
okay_1 then there are for people doing drugs	2335	B
they ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them_1 go let them_1 go	2335	B
you know give them_1 a fine whatever make them_1 do civic duty whatever put them fools in there that's what they need to put i call- i call them_1 all fools idiots whatever little rock stars put all them_1 in there	2335	B
you know the murderers the the drug dealers the user put them_1 all in jail you know and let all the normal people go	2335	B
you know because_1 okay	2335	B
if you write a bad check you go to jail right	2335	B
okay_1 let them people go	2335	B
not let them_1 go and get out of it let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else	2335	B
you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is but	2335	B
put don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
um-hum	2335	B
so	2335	B
i don't know them people boy they got the- i think the United States has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
now how they gonna fix it i don't know the i don't think there is a ready solution	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
because_1 the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it	2335	B
uh he's gonna have to work extra hard just to make ends meet	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
um-hum	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
yeah	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
that's it	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
so you know they i i know that's bad but you know the- just like Texas now	2335	B
they could of had a lottery they don't want a lottery why not	2335	B
i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever i'm paying you know a week or whatever	2335	B
and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck	2335	B
	2335	B
because_1 we're paying for Social Security they using now who's gonna pay for mine	2335	B
yeah but it's it's nah you don't count on Social Security but it's it's that's what i'm saying they need to do something else	2335	B
but	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
crime is gonna go up as long as the economy stays down	2335	B
and it's gonna get worse that's just like last night they killed them people in that store where you at	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
 oh no wonder you don't know then-	2335	B
 they killed	2335	B
i'm in Dallas	2335	B
 but last night they killed uh uh four people in a chain food	2335	B
and killed them_1 well it was two stores side by side	2335	B
 one was a store and one was like a a fast food place i think it- chicken or something i don't know anyway they raped the women	2335	B
beat them_1 all up including the women i mean they just beat them_1	2335	B
stuffed them_1 in the freezer and then shot them_1 all	2335	B
now- why was you know dumb	2335	B
you know why didn't they just if they was gonna lock just lock them_1 in the freezer take the money you know they didn't have to kill them_1 or rape them_1 or anything	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
um-hum	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
well i think if it's the town is smaller	2335	B
and everybody knows everybody it's harder to come in there and do something	2335	B
where is- and and and see that's another thing neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods anymore	2335	B
there's nobody next door to you you don't know your neighbors and stuff like that	2335	B
	2335	B
and you didn't even and the what the manager the manager won't even do anything	2335	B
<silence>	2335	B
um-hum	2335	B
you don't and so i moved because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up	2335	B
you know and this is like across the street this was a nice part of town	2335	B
and then across the street one of the apartments blew up because_1 they were having that making that um	2335	B
crack stuff and then the other time i saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner i said see this is it	2335	B
that's it and i moved and you know now i live in like a family- a neighborhood in a townhouse but it's nice i don't you know	2335	B

uh the causes of crime um i think it was an imbalance of of power in the United States that's causing the lower class- class to rebel	2335	A
that's why there's such- such high crime in uh	2335	A
there's crime in uh young people because they don't have real- role models	2335	A
see too much crime on TV and they think it's way to go	2335	A

it's pretty nice	2335	A
<silence>	2335	A
	2335	A
<silence>	2335	A
yeah	2335	A
<silence>	2335	A
yeah	2335	A
<silence>	2335	A
yeah	2335	A
most of them_1 too scared to do anything about it	2335	A
<silence>	2335	A
yeah	2335	A
all right well listen i got to go it's good talking to you	2335	A
{alrighty} bye-bye	2335	A
	2335	A
<silence>	2335	A
<silence>	2305	A
well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do uh once they have that then they can start looking in	2305	A
all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves	2305	A
and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer	2305	A
um-hum	2305	A
yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's it's your core education your general requirements- general education requirements um	2305	A
if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to that's what i did	2305	A
 i didn't care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go	2305	A
uh political science	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
where are you at	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
well yeah i guess everybody's in Dallas that i talk to i'm in north Carolina	2305	A
yeah right	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
sure	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
oh yeah	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
um	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
uh-huh	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
yeah it does Um i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned	2305	A
uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration And i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it i didn't want it	2305	A
Um and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up	2305	A
and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that's that's where i wanted to be but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree	2305	A
and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i like	2305	A
and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to so that's that's what i'm pursuing right now	2305	A
and i'm pretty happy with it so far	2305	A
	2305	A
uh-huh	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
yeah that's probably very useful	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
uh-huh	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
uh-huh	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
 yeah yeah	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
oh good grief	2305	A
yeah	2305	A
yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn't do this everyday no way	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
i am a disgruntled- i am i am just a disgruntled person all around i'm the uh i'm the uh original uh mister Scrooge i guess	2305	A
yeah bah humbug Yeah i just	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
oh you probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
well that remark in itself is a slam my best friends are lawyers you know like like uh you know my best friends are blacks	2305	A
 jewish now blacks and i guess i i guess uh Iraqi now is the	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school	2305	A
and it doesn't become fun anymore	2305	A
	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
yeah you going	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
oh yeah Yeah if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
it is	2305	A
yeah very much so yeah it's it's a lot of that Um it it was enjoyable for a while	2305	A
um but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer	2305	A
to do it if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and i aged ten years	2305	A
but i i i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world i mean it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law	2305	A
	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
what branch were you in what branch were you in i was too	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
yeah	2305	A
yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh uh command post	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
i was just wondering were you in SAC by any chance	2305	A
were you in SAC	2305	A
SAC	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh R C one thirty fives	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
oh	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
 well that's	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
uh-huh	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
yeah	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
yeah	2305	A
that's right and it	2305	A
and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
uh-huh sure	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
that's true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at McDonald's	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
yeah yeah i was the same way too i'm not a people person i i i hate um	2305	A
having to play such a nice guy you know especially when it's all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in	2305	A
i it's just not for me i'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that	2305	A
which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot	2305	A
<silence>	2305	A
okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh	2305	B
information about selecting a school	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
uh do you do you feel that the first two years that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years	2305	B
but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah what was your degree in	2305	B
political science oh okay well i know- i know i'm going to school right now and uh i have a friend uh UTD University of Texas Dallas	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
i know well that's where Texas Instruments is	2305	B
um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a friend i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine	2305	B
a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public	2305	B
um institution	2305	B
and uh it's a lot cheaper my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years	2305	B
and she found out after that she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago but uh	2305	B
well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
um-hum	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
	2305	B
 okay	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
right	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
um	2305	B
yeah yeah i'm i'm pursuing what they what's what's called an interdisciplinary field i'm a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background and	2305	B
yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics	2305	B
and some psychology so it's all working together the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really	2305	B
so it's a	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
um	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
oh	2305	B
so you are a disgruntled graduate student	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
oh	2305	B
	2305	B
yeah bah humbug	2305	B
 i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about	2305	B
fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers about uh their integrity being questionable and i mean oh that was like a can of worms no	2305	B
no there was a woman she said my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this and it was just	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah i know it was	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
or or Jewish it used to be Jewish you know	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
 i know it but	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
yeah i have a i have a friend she's studying she's going into law another friend going into law and that she's i i i'm really i'm really concerned about you know she's just going to be	2305	B
you know what's going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful i i see i see that happening	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B

<silence>	2305	B
uh-huh	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an	2305	B
i guess uh United States Institution it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest huh	2305	B
i was in the Air Force yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah well what was your job	2305	B

i didn't make -it i sort of washed out	2305	B
 yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's it's something you know i think that's why you know children really need to	2305	B
think about the field they're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they actually should do some reading and they should study it	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah i i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
oh and i tell you what i worked at McDonald's as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where	2305	B
 i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a lab- as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B
yeah	2305	B
<silence>	2305	B

you know she might call me during a halftime or after the game or something but i just don't call her and now they're starting up with new football	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
it's	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
you think it's seasonal you think it goes with the season	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
yeah	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B

	2306	B
oh listen to it	2306	B
yeah	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B

well we kind of do but ours our it its hot here i'm in shorts	2306	B
and people have their air conditioners on already it has been hot and humid here and so but our summers sometimes start in June and they don't end till like November i mean it's hot so we watch football in the heat here	2306	B
so i it might not matter Texans are real football minded people	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
oh	2306	B
oh well i know	2306	B
i think so i think they did better this last year so	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
yeah people say they wish they had a roof on it though it doesn't look finished	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
i've never been in an enclosed one	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
yeah yeah so Ohio has how many football teams two well so does Texas	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
that's right they have the Colts now like	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
yeah i went one time to um okay Minneapolis	2306	B
ah to the uh Vikings i went to a Viking Bear game one year oh many years ago now my gosh it's probably been twenty years and that was a real experience because_1 there are some fans there and i guess that's a big game	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
oh	2306	B
oh how neat	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
oh	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
on that's wonderful- oh that's what an experience to see your students you know grown up and playing football	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
yeah you sure did what grade did you teach or	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
oh my gosh	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
so no wonder you like sports so you were a physical education teacher	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
oh that's wonderful	2306	B
<silence>	2306	B
<silence>	2306	A
well probably my favorite TV program is Murder She Wrote	2306	A
i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are my- my favorite kinds of programs	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
well the	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
	2306	A
no well i don't think we get it here	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
huh-uh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
oh what kinds of things do they uh show	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
oh my word	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
oh my word	2306	A
	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
probably things that that there happen every day and we don't even notice them until someone videotapes them_1	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
is that right	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
um-hum	2306	A
yeah i saw that for the first time yesterday in the evening	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
yeah uh i have never seen her show but after hearing her sing the Star Spangled Banner anthem i will never watch her show	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
oh yeah right um-hum	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
do you	2306	A
oh yes that's a good program uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
oh okay	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
well i think that they uh they seem like they are friends with one another and with all of their guests rather than just interviewing	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
	2306	A
did they	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
well great	2306	A
course i have to admit i- i love uh when the fall comes i love uh football	2306	A
and i watch all the football games Monday night Thursday night and Sunday afternoon	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
well and not everybody is	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
yeah but uh i can't get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
yeah i because_1 i always hate to see it end in January i'd like to see it go on for a couple of months but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesn't uh doesn't click now i enjoy	2306	A
going to baseball games but i don't enjoy watching them on television and i don't enjoy watching basketball on television they're they're both well baseball's so slow	2306	A
and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot and um	2306	A
uh because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh develop- develop	2306	A
and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to baseball and i'll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world	2306	A
but uh but uh no i won't watch it i'll listen to it on the radio yeah while i'm doing something else but i won't sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring	2306	A
but i- i don't watch i don't sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
yes we certainly do	2306	A
	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
are you	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
um-hum	2306	A
sure right i guess so	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
um oh with the Dallas Cowboys although they haven't done very well the last couple of years but uh they'll be back up there	2306	A
yeah they'll they'll climb back up again and that Texas Stadium i've been there that is a phenomenal place	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
	2306	A
well and i think that's maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed	2306	A
oh i well i have and they're very noisy	2306	A
and uh then of course i've been up to uh Cleveland Ohio where the Cleveland Browns play and that's just a wide open stadium and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh	2306	A
but um now go down to Cincinnati and they have a nice stadium down there but it's it's all open also	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
two yeah	2306	A
yeah and then of course Indianapolis which is only a hundred miles away from us has the Colts yeah	2306	A
so uh they they've got a lot of sports going on around here	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
oh yeah	2306	A
oh yeah	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
well i uh	2306	A
i'm retired from education i	2306	A
worked thirty four years as a teacher and administrator in the Dayton here this the Dayton school system	2306	A
and uh several of my players uh players several of my former students uh played with Minnesota Vikings and then with the Cleveland Browns	2306	A
yeah it was it was fun because uh they would call when they were with the Browns they would call and say we left tickets at the gate for you all come on up so we would hop in the car the next morning and drive up and	2306	A
we have tickets waiting for us	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
<silence>	2306	A
oh	2306	A
oh sure one of them was grown up and was Chief of Police here	2306	A
	2306	A
yeah right when you see the ones who are successful and there are many of them around and uh makes me feel good to know i played one small part in their rearing	2306	A
well i- i uh when i first started out teaching it was uh at college level	2306	A
and then uh after we moved here to Dayton then i went to the high school level i really enjoyed that more	2306	A
and so then i taught the physical education actually uh with the i was the specialist in water safety and uh so i taught uh the the uh physical education	2306	A
and swimming um on the high school level and then they just kept pushing me into administration and	2306	A
and i wound up as an assistant principal and then i went down to the central office and was part of a team to to to develop a program to evaluate schools and and	2306	A
to uh try to resolve problems within schools	2306	A
yes sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a Czechoslovakian Turner Society and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and	2306	A
they had things that were similar to the Olympics uh the Czechoslovakian Turner Society did so it was it was exciting we competed on the rings and balance beam	2306	A
	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
uh somewhat they're not my favorite team but uh yeah i am uh somewhat familiar with them	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
i follow the Milwaukee Brewers mostly	2319	B
basically because- because that's where i came from and uh grew up following them as a kid	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
okay	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
well uh	2319	B
	2319	B
i don't think they're going to challenge for the lead in the east	2319	B
uh they they've got a lot of uh rebuilding to do	2319	B
they traded for a lot of new players uh in in the off season and it looks like it might help them but uh i think this is going to be a year for pulling together and looking for the future	2319	B
yeah uh-huh	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
well there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
 okay	2319	B
they might just be fishing to see what they can get for him	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah i agree they're paying him too much money and uh for- for the kind of money they're paying him right now i think it's one point six million dollars they can get a pretty good quality outfielder	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah i'm looking forward to seeing Nolan Ryan pitch	2319	B
but uh	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
i think the rest of the staff is uh a little weak	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
right	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
he's hot and cold	2319	B
he'll have an outstanding outing and the next time he'll get shelled	2319	B
so	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
	2319	B
i see	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
i guess Ruben Sierra's got an entirely new attitude this season	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
he claims to be out there to play ball	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah they say he's really been hustling	2319	B
never	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
well i felt a little guilty but not much when uh Robin Yount won the MVP instead of Sierra	2319	B
the other year	2319	B
but uh Yount has been a he's he's a player uh year in year out and always uh is leading the team in uh most of most of their offensive categories	2319	B
he really is a team player	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah and he hasn't really shown the the talent uh or the promise that they saw when he was at Oklahoma State	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
Juan Gonzalez	2319	B
yeah he looks to be a a up and coming uh performer	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
well given the Rangers' history they'll probably trade him	2319	B
	2319	B
and then he'll	2319	B
right somewhere else	2319	B
that that seems to be the way the Rangers operate	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
how do you think Oakland's going to do	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
for what they're paying they ought to get they ought to get the performance out of those guys uh	2319	B
Canseco's making five million a year	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah i i agree	2319	B
i think it is and when when the players themselves are turning down contracts that are three or four years in duration for three or four million dollars a year looking for more money yet	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
sure	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
well it's it's a bidding war between teams and it's also popularity contest between sports to see who can get the biggest uh paycheck	2319	B
because baseball	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
that's true they keep raising the ticket prices every year	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah and with what those guys get paid then they go out uh besides baseball and and advertise products or they they charge ten or fifteen dollars for a autograph	2319	B
	2319	B
they've got all this supplemental income coming in as if they aren't making enough already as uh stars of the sport	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
sure yeah i might get to maybe one game out of the year uh in person uh but uh having cable TV and HSE	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah i'll watch quite a few games on TV	2319	B
especially to somebody like Nolan pitch	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
Brewers always have such hard luck Teddy Higuera is hurt again	2319	B
he was supposed to pitch an exhibition in Mexico against Fernando Valenzuela	2319	B
and uh he had a torn rotator cup	2319	B
so he's out for at least uh oh i don't know how many weeks or months they said	2319	B
but he may not pitch this season again	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
but he's the star of that uh team their pitching staff and when he sits out they fizzle	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
that seems typical because most of their other stars uh Paul Molitor's usually out half the season with injuries himself	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah they end up juggling the lineup and trying to fit uh more inexperienced players into those roles and they just don't have the leadership don't have the skills to carry a team	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
well i think it will be fun i'm ready for baseball season to start	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah ah i agree with that	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
right well the preseason really doesn't mean anything either	2319	B
because the players- the teams uh usually play in split squads and they're either playing their rookies or their uh	2319	B
uh	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
so once the season gets underway you know they're out there to be serious about what they're doing trying to win games and uh	2319	B
i take it from there	2319	B
<silence>	2319	B
okay well good luck to the Rangers this season see if they can pull one out	2319	B
all right sure thanks bye	2319	B
	2319	B
	2319	A
uh i guess being here in Dallas are you familiar with the Rangers	2319	A
okay	2319	A
	2319	A
i see what team do you follow	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
i see	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
okay okay that's interesting	2319	A
i guess really though i'm a native Texan so that really the about the only team i've ever uh followed has been the Rangers	2319	A
and uh uh what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
is that right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
sort of a building season- season yeah	2319	A
shoot the Rangers i don't know what the there's no telling what they'll do they'll probably-	2319	A
uh they won't do anything until the all star break and then uh then they'll perk up a little bit and that seems to be their uh their average pace but	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah uh i heard that but i heard on uh uh the radio this morning that that uh	2319	A
you know old Bobby Valentine said that there was no no uh truth to that but you never can tell	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
that's right and i don't know personally i'd like to get rid of him i think he's sort of a showboat and really hadn't produced you know a whole lot but uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah when they're going to have to spend some money and i think build up their pitching staff uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah it would be interesting to see how he does this year	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah i heard uh just i guess last night they got beat uh and Bobby Witt was the pitcher and he's supposed to be uh you know their their hot guy	2319	A
and uh sounded like he got pounded pretty hard	2319	A
yeah	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right and and that's really what the Rangers need some some consistency you know outer starter	2319	A
and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting	2319	A
uh my at work my boss got season tickets this year	2319	A
so uh hopefully if i'm real nice to him he's going throw a couple of those my way every now and then so it will be fun to go out there and watch them	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
that's what they said that uh he really worked out you know hard in off season and uh maybe he can catch a fly ball or two this year	2319	A
right God he need to i mean he's got all the talent in the world when it comes around to to hitting the baseball	2319	A
but uh i mean you got to be a total player when you're in the pros	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah uh i don't know	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
is that right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
well that's what it takes to uh because uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right to to actually be a leader uh a team leader	2319	A
and uh you know the Rangers really don't have any star players besides Ryan that uh i think the other players look up to	2319	A
because Incaviglia i don't think you know uh he stands out to be a a real leader	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right right sounds like they have a young guy that they're putting a lot of weight into uh that Juan Gonzalez yeah	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah so it be interesting to see you know i think and make him progress and uh get him on board	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
 and then he'll become an all star	2319	A
	2319	A
that's right	2319	A
that's exactly right	2319	A
but uh	2319	A
well i'll tell you what it will be interesting to to get the baseball season going and see how everything turns out	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
i don't know i tell you what they've uh they've got a big enough payroll they need to uh uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
go back	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
that's exactly right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah and i i just don't see uh you know a baseball player being worth that	2319	A
 or any really any pro pro athlete because we look at that compared to what uh normal people make i mean it's just totally outrageous	2319	A
and uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah -that that that's what ticks me off about old uh Henderson you know wanting to renegotiate- renegotiate his contract because uh uh he's not the highest paid player anymore	2319	A
well man that's that's just ridiculous	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
exactly and you know ultimately the the consumer and the uh fan are the people that have to pay for it through the	2319	A
right and through advertisements you know on TV uh because a TV contract is really where they rake in the money and	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right that's right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
exactly and uh	2319	A
you know so i i don't know personally uh you know i'll pay keep paying whatever the ticket prices are but	2319	A
and uh it really does irk me to see those guys out there uh you know making that much money	2319	A
and uh and then the the public you know just continues to you know help support and funnel the funds into uh to make it happen whatever it costs	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
well that's right you can get your your fill just about	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right right	2319	A
so uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
oh really	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
oh yeah	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
oh jeez	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
golly	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
oh man that's ridiculous	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
oh man that makes it tough on the the whole club the management all the way down the rest players	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
yeah	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right right	2319	A
	2319	A
well it will be interesting	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
i sort of am too uh i enjoy going out to a couple of the games and and uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
i really don't get that involved until the play-offs though uh	2319	A
you know the season's just so long	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
that's right depending on what night it is and where they're at uh on whose playing	2319	A
and uh	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
right right	2319	A
well i tell you what i appreciate the conversation and uh we'll just have to watch and see how it goes comes about	2319	A
<silence>	2319	A
all righty we'll-	2319	A
we'll talk to you later bye-bye	2319	A
	2319	A
hi	2365	B
uh as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom	2365	B
and i had wallpaper up	2365	B
i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry	2365	B
and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
no i i just painted	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh no actually the wall behind the paper was smooth so i just used a like a semigloss	2365	B
and	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
well no not really i need to it it looks so bad our you can see where those spackling marks were i need to uh either paper back over it or do something	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah it covered the spots pretty good but it didn't excuse me it didn't uh	2365	B
uh it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
was it like a primer	2365	B
would you put a huh uh-huh	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
oh my goodness that's an awful lot	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
not inside now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it that was one of the requirements from you know FHA	2365	B
that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim	2365	B
around the house was uh if i remember right it was like uh five hundred dollars	2365	B
yeah yeah	2365	B
so that wasn't too bad	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
no i haven't	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
oh so they did do a good job	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah yeah as a matter of fact uh what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh	2365	B
a blue and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn't match	2365	B
you know	2365	B
the very same type of paint and everything	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
so	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
oh i have no idea i repainted the whole thing	2365	B
	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah that's right	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
white yeah that's what we're trying to get ours to look like	2365	B
	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
oh i see	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color-	2365	B
okay white	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
well uh what about the lighting did it make a big difference	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
oh uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
so that uh you get some the color doesn't really matter for because you have that light	2365	B
all time oh	2365	B
I see	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
and it takes a long time	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
yeah really no kidding	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
it is a lot of work a lot of work	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
nice talking to you thanks a lot bye	2365	B
	2365	B
<silence>	2365	B
hi	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
you didn't try we {rewallpapering} you just uh	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
did you use a textured paint or	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
um	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
well did you get good results	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
yeah	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
but just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
well we did a uh	2365	A
we moved oh last August and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down	2365	A
and then you can just paint right over the dark	2365	A
well more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling	2365	A
and uh it was smooth and uh and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or or did something to it and	2365	A
but because of the the- dark behind it was really really hard to cover	2365	A
and	2365	A
yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn't done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it and it it really was	2365	A
you know the advice they give you is uh the job was considerably tougher than we thought	2365	A
uh particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling and	2365	A
uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
yeah	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
yeah	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
oh that's quite reasonable	2365	A
	2365	A
um	2365	A
the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately	2365	A
my wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took this is not on the topic but i did finish it but my wife went to the uh Home Depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy of took a piece of brick	2365	A
and she wanted to paint the shed it's a it's a wooden shed uh and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint	2365	A
and uh they got and uh and in fact she put some right back- she got they mixed uh a gallon of it and uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint	2365	A
uh and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic	2365	A
yeah you know they it but it's electronic	2365	A
uh you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and and uh and determines the	2365	A
and it it's really remarkable uh the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim	2365	A
and uh but they didn't didn't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample	2365	A
um from i forgotten this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway it's it's remarkable that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the	2365	A
you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
um	2365	A
so	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
gosh	2365	A
so you so what's your what's the solution then	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
oh my	2365	A
well at least you'll get very good at it right	2365	A
you could go back and and paint the whole thing over that's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do i'll just do a little bit here and a little that	2365	A
although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside	2365	A
and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't uh the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
oh good luck we wound up selling the house actually i i don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white um	2365	A
makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls that you know up a couple of feet	2365	A
and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue	2365	A
and uh	2365	A
 it makes the room look remarkably smaller	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
the trim is still white	2365	A
the the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is uh	2365	A
uh which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldn't think that i well	2365	A
maybe maybe somebody that understands colors would know all of that stuff but	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
uh not particularly because the house has so many windows uh it has the the the living room has four uh good size windows	2365	A
and uh well of course at night but with the	2365	A
we have we have we have a soccer field that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house	2365	A
and the lights shine right at our house it's kind of	2365	A
we didn't know that when we bought the house but	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it it it um well it's just uh i think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so	2365	A
anyway it didn't it didn't change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're	2365	A
we're really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
that's right you can work yourself to death well i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
it's kind of frustrating	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
well i've got to go to a meeting it's been good talking to you	2365	A
okay good-bye	2365	A
	2365	A
<silence>	2365	A
	2300	A
okay so do you all keep a budget	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
you don't	2300	A
well	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
are you being smart or are you serious	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
that's funny yeah we have a we're twenty eight and he's been working at TI for five years	2300	A
and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because_1 he'd worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so we're	2300	A
you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because_1 you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of	2300	A
we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house	2300	A
but we don't you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand	2300	A
so you know we have trade-offs so we're more we have a monthly budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isn't real wise but	2300	A
we just we don't have the income at this time really to have any because_1 we have um three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans we're still paying trying to pay those off	2300	A
and we have one car payment that we're i think we have about thirteen months left on it	2300	A
and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment	2300	A
um they'll pay our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars	2300	A
and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and it'll work out perfect	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
no we don't	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
really	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
oh really	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
does she have to pay to have it refinanced	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
TIer to	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of uh drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago right when right when he got hired for TI right before he got hired for TI he'd uh gotten saved and stuff	2300	A
and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you don't have anything	2300	A
you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas	2300	A
but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and we'd look about nineteen people still think we're about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us	2300	A
and so it's just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know	2300	A
so we went in and they financed the car for five and we didn't know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so we're kind of upset that we're having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so	2300	A
you know	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher	2300	A
and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers	2300	A
and i maybe i might have been there i don't remember hearing that but i also wasn't the one in charge of it so i wasn't paying as close of attention	2300	A
but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house	2300	A
we attended a Bill Guathier financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free	2300	A
and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we'll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that	2300	A
and then	2300	A
right	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
right	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
right	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
right	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
oh really	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
right yeah we real we've become aware of that we have a there's a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know	2300	A
and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so	2300	A
you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
really	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
oh my	2300	A
i stopped payment on a check oh that's funny	2300	A
oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at Zak's and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it	2300	A
and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they don't sue us over it but we never received any merchandise either so i don't think it would hold any	2300	A
anyway	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
no we didn't even call them we just did it maybe my husband should call today	2300	A
<silence>	2300	A
	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
no we don't	2300	B
no i just i- i make so much money here at TI that that we just spend it	2300	B
and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck it's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm you can just spend it well	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
i'm being facetious i'm being very comical uh we have a budget um that works well i kind of look at it for more of a we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator i guess that that uh	2300	B
or i guess the financial planners the training now we've had it for about four years who got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing	2300	B
and there's some freebies out there are you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly monthly bring home in some sort of savings account that being money market uh bonds coda mat savings uh	2300	B
or a listed liquid account and which which we do um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that	2300	B
okay you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm he's going to sue the pants off of you	2300	B
these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so you- you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them_1 are there to pacify situations and some of them_1 are there to prevent things from happening	2300	B
but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a a child which is about a year old and then uh	2300	B
we've just been kind of	2300	B
working on i've been developing it but it's kind of hard diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know	2300	B
	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
do you have your uh loans through the Texas Credit Union	2300	B
okay thing about the credit union is it's the way it's set up is if you have	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
two thousand dollars left let's say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal	2300	B
they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know so it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans not really the best in the world but	2300	B
but you know they're- they're uh since your husband is is is um uh a TIer but doesn't have the loans with the credit union they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don't know what your percent is on your on your car payments	2300	B
but they are they'll take any TI non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car they'll take it	2300	B
and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at i think it's a ten and a quarter percent	2300	B
which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something	2300	B
and she's doing it i mean it's not like it's like	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
i think they even cover that because they want you as a uh uh they want the TIer to be part of the credit union	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
yeah	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
well five years is not that uh you know five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest but your um payments- your payments are lower	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
oh really	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
sure	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
yes	2300	B
you save a lot	2300	B
if if if if and you need to be very careful	2300	B
if the loan is set up to have bimonthly- they call it a yuppie loan if it's set up for bimonthly payments if you because you'll save seventeen- fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan seven- i'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan	2300	B
and there are there is a local firm that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available	2300	B
i can have- this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee so i can cut that much off the end of but i'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year	2300	B
yeah but uh those are all great the the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a house built	2300	B
is it's not a lot of the firms that offer mortgage- mortgage loan firms aren't offering um that loan	2300	B
i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man	2300	B
and if you figure get with a financial person and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment	2300	B
over and above your house payment it'll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i it'll shave almost you know X number of dollars off	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
sure	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
somebody you trust uh you know there are so many rip-off artists here in this town it's it's and it's uh it's really a sin it really is	2300	B
i got taken on some firewood- on firewood	2300	B
i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood and my wife didn't know and i stopped payment on the check and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm and and they're suing us they're suing me on this and it's for a hundred and thirty four dollars	2300	B
absolutely pathetic	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
oh okay well something- well probably something like -that did you call them_1 and tell them you just you just	2300	B
<silence>	2300	B
might be a good idea because_1 because_1 you're going to get what a a check uh	2300	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh we live in a one story just like a ranch style home you know the the standard Texas uh Fox and Jacobs	2368	B
	2368	B
how about_1 you guys	2368	B
are you in a house- apartment or a house	2368	B
well they say that those are easy to find- or difficult to find	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
how are rents doing i haven't looked at rents in a long time	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
what's a what's a one bedroom are you in a um well Plano most most complexes in Plano are pretty nice so you're probably in a you know	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
um-hum	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
ooh that does get high yeah i mean	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it it drops um seems like in the last six months we um got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty	2368	B
so that's really not i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too but i couldn't believe it but you know	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
and then i think that um nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just i mean we've been in ours for about ten years but uh there's no investment in it you know	2368	B
all it allows you to do is itemize	2368	B
on your	2368	B
on your taxes yeah that's really about it it's uh have you ever owned your own home	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah suburban track yeah	2368	B
we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back and uh we lived in a smaller city and now we say gee Dallas really is big and polluted	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah it's really it's really sad because they're they're not doing anything well we're getting off the subject i guess but just like with housing i mean they're not doing anything about pollution they're not doing anything about it's going to look like Houston- have you ever been to Houston	2368	B
you know um i used to think Dallas was better than Houston because_1 their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me you know	2368	B
we've been in here ten years	2368	B
yeah so we've got you know we've got some investment in it but you really don't get anything out of it	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah smaller we were up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania	2368	B
my home town um the prices	2368	B
actually a lot better because_1 Pittsburgh is about the size i'm trying to think like a Louisville or Minneapolis that type of size	2368	B
and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty	2368	B
	2368	B
um	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah Saint Louis whatever	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
really	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
i guess it's yeah but and here i guess it depends on what you want you know here once people like i know a lot of people that work for JC Penney in marketing	2368	B
and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it	2368	B
but but they love it i mean they they they think that they're getting you know you say um sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there and they don't miss in public relations and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
and i said you haven't heard about tornados how about_1 bugs you know	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yep	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
that's exactly uh growing i grew up in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because_1 i never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know	2368	B
but uh um the housing is just we like the older homes and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends you know i mean	2368	B
pardon me	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah actually when we were up north um but some family things changed so we ended up coming back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work but um	2368	B
we really would like to but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know it	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
	2368	B
yeah it it's real tough i mean the economy any more i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know it's um pardon me	2368	B
yes i do	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh no we don't	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh how do i take care of the house well i don't have a Mexican- i don't i shouldn't say that i don't have an ethnic maid i don't have we have some friends that live near North Dallas off of Campbell Road and they have like a four thousand square foot home and she's got a uh	2368	B
a live out nanny um but any rate i don't have any of that um i don't know it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know	2368	B
we have a	2368	B
yeah we have a dog and we're pretty i mean we're not fanatically neat but um we keep things up you know it's not like where there's three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to um get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
um no we're pretty much um we we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wallpaper together	2368	B
and things like that um we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that's not a um i mean i know how to fix a running toilet	2368	B
he does what he needs to but mostly if it's something major um you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
 yeah no thanks i	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
have you ever done that i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
and how'd that go	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
getting to agree to things that i'm sure and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older	2368	B
you start um the dollar value on things	2368	B
i you know i think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic	2368	B
i know i'm supposed to talk about homes but people that own- the people that own them are the home homes themselves and you know um spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesn't	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah that's	2368	B
i mean and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from uh west from uh from New York with Exxon or JC Penney and it's just a hoot to watch them	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
right right exactly so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
oh my goodness yeah	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
well in a way you can travel light	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
	2368	B
yes i do	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
everybody pretty much keep- keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah relax and try to go to sleep really yeah	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
and i think Plano in general is getting a little more well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
isn't that something yeah the price of home now we paid	2368	B
oh we paid um about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and	2368	B
i'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent	2368	B
so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize	2368	B
<silence>	2368	B
yeah exactly we	2368	B
yeah and even you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania but um it was an older home but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up	2368	B
so you know	2368	B
<silence>	2368	A
um what kind of house do you live in	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
with with a yard and fence	2368	A
i'm in an apartment in uh Plano	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah they are if uh kind of depends on what you're looking for mine's just a one bedroom place that's uh	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
uh it's hard for me to tell because i haven't rented in uh probably twenty twenty five years	2368	A
and uh just i'm getting back into apartment life	2368	A
and it's	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah but	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
well they vary from from place to place it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found and uh	2368	A
they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place	2368	A
yeah it does considering that you know you uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
wow that's a lot for a townhouse	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
but that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these they i guess they know they're going to get it	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
yeah that's true you just take off your mortgage interest and that's about it	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
oh yeah i've owned uh several and built several uh	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
 well well and especially around North Dallas or at least in Plano area they basically all look alike because_1 Fox and Jacobs and	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
isn't it i can remember i've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in Wylie and i could see downtown Dallas	2368	A
and now there's this brown haze over it and it's moving north	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah it does how- how long have you been in this house	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
ten years	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
no you really don't were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than than Dallas area	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
how were the how were the house prices up there	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
wow	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
hum	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
well you know a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back East especially from JC Penney	2368	A
uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here	2368	A
and they've wind up getting better houses here than they had there	2368	A
so in a way i guess it works both ways you know	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
that's a fact	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
 i guess that's true and they don't have to worry about yard upkeep because_1 they don't hardly have any	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
that's true there's not too many basements in Texas	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
	2368	A
yeah gosh i remember when i was little uh we didn't have a i lived grew up in southern Oklahoma and uh people across the street had a cellar and we- we never did	2368	A
and it's just like Dallas area it was tornado alley up there and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street and we'd go into the cellar and i	2368	A
to this day i don't care if i go or not you know if it's going to get me it's get me	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
you ever thought about building a house	2368	A
you ever thought about building a house	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah that's true especially well well TI is like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here or be in one place you know	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah do you work	2368	A
do you work	2368	A
so how do you handle do you got any kids	2368	A
so you got he's working and you're working and you got this big house to take care of how do you manage both of those	2368	A
	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
you basically can take care of everything yourself	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
what about home repairs and stuff do you have to do all that yourself or	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
wow you too	2368	A
	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah sounds like you you've already got the makings for being a general contractor	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
	2368	A
if you don't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah i built three houses in my life and	2368	A
oh they the the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah-	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
you bet	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh you bet	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
well to some of them i guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to to take care of it but	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
hum	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
um-hum	2368	A
oh yeah they as far as they're concerned they've come to the promised land you know they've got it made already	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh yeah because you're combine uh confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story house- house and i had room for everything	2368	A
in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with i don't know it's it's seems like room uh stuff always expands to fill available- available space but	2368	A
uh	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah you can yeah you know you learn- you adjust you figure out	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
it's not as bad as i thought it was	2368	A
uh it's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be	2368	A
uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around and there's there's traffic and there's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah pretty much and uh there's never really any any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them_1 that	2368	A
uh that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet	2368	A
yeah yeah you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes or playing ball or jogging or doing this and that	2368	A
and uh they're trying to to unwind	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh yeah it's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh you bet and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh	2368	A
you're always paying for something you know	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
um-hum	2368	A
<silence>	2368	A
oh you are constantly there's always something going wrong	2368	A
<silence>	2348	A
hi Ellen	2348	A
um do you uh could you tell me if you uh budget your monthly expenses	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
uh yeah	2348	A
okay that's uh uh we used to budget when the children were small	2348	A
um	2348	A
things were and there was only one income so we had to watch what we were doing	2348	A
and our savings weren't that great but now the kids are all grown up and gone in fact the youngest is is uh	2348	A
finally getting out of college this uh May	2348	A
so we've we don't budget anymore we run basically the same as you do you kind of know what you're going to spend uh week to week or or you have your monthly bills at a fixed	2348	A
um as far as electricity and telephone and	2348	A
um we do the same thing we budget not budget but um i have a long term savings goal	2348	A
for retirement you know	2348	A
they take out for CODA and then uh um	2348	A
the IRA's	2348	A
and then uh i also take out for	2348	A
um a savings account but it's it's uh	2348	A
	2348	A
um it's not really savings- it's savings if we don't spend it	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
it's like a floating you know if something if something comes up	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
yes	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
right yeah	2348	A
it it	2348	A
it doesn't come out um	2348	A
it doesn't come out of long term savings like we were we were um saving savings bonds too for oh years and years and years and now i'm getting up towards retirement age so	2348	A
we stopped stopped the the savings bonds and we're going {maxed} out on CODA and then	2348	A
you know other things like you know CD's	2348	A
um	2348	A
but this other it's in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend	2348	A
that's what we hit	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant	2348	A
um that'll come out of that	2348	A
rather than put it on a credit card	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
right	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um	2348	A
	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
yeah	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and they'll say you know well you've got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever	2348	A
but yeah it's it's it's kind of forced on you	2348	A
because you suffer a penalty	2348	A
so that's yeah that's one of the that's one of the ways that we do it you you also have uh CODA	2348	A
so	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
that's yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with	2348	A
i mean that's fantastic	2348	A
you know they match it um	2348	A
my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasn't been working for a couple of years her father took sick so she's been taking care of him	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers	2348	A
steam or momentum and you don't realize it you know it just	2348	A
piles up	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
um yeah we we took out actually my wife	2348	A
she's the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up so much went for groceries	2348	A
	2348	A
so much went for the mortgage because_1 we knew you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you could come pretty close and telephone you could come pretty close uh the oil	2348	A
we heated with oil	2348	A
we they put us on a budget they would run like uh they could really tell how much oil you were going to use	2348	A
so they budgeted it at year round	2348	A
so in the summer time	2348	A
which you didn't use very little oil	2348	A
you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when you're using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out	2348	A
and	2348	A
we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didn't go out to eat that often	2348	A
but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it	2348	A
it it became a chore	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
yeah i talked to to uh	2348	A
	2348	A
other people and they used to have envelopes they used to stuff so much in you know so much for this so much for that so much for we never really we never really did that	2348	A
we just allocated so much and it went into a checking account	2348	A
and at the end of the month hopefully everything came out pretty close	2348	A
so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries	2348	A
um but even at that point you know she'd say oh you know we we need this or the budget's not doing this or that uh	2348	A
course me i didn't run it like she ran it like you run it now	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
and it's pretty much the same she still does the same thing everything's fixed	2348	A
you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay	2348	A
so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it	2348	A
as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
so we don't really see anything if if i need something i'll go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something she'll go and she'll use the teller machine	2348	A
so we don't really um have a lot of cash anymore	2348	A
yeah i i walk around sometimes and i've got if i've got five dollars in my pocket that's that's a lot it's	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
yeah for your automobile	2348	A
you mean gas yeah and now i don't know about down there but up here they got the pumps you just put your because_1 i always put my gas on a credit card and i pay it at the end of the month	2348	A
so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go	2348	A
so you don't even have to go in to see the teller anymore	2348	A
yeah yeah it's not bad so you don't need you don't need money for gasoline you don't need money you know incidentals	2348	A
uh	2348	A
for coffee when i come into work in the morning and things like that but other than that	2348	A
um it looks like we're probably going towards a cashless society	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
because if you're doing that	2348	A
you know and i'm sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas	2348	A
um and we're doing it most- most of the people up here that work have- already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their banks or the credit union if they belong to the credit union	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
so they don't deal much in cash anymore either	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
so it looks like we're both running about the same	2348	A
um	2348	A
maybe younger people are different i'm not sure	2348	A
uh	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
they don't have spendable income right yeah the poor poor things i know like you know	2348	A
 i look at mine and he's getting out of school and i'm saying geez you know i'm glad i'm not starting out now because_1	2348	A
things are kind of tough up here for as far as uh employment goes	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
still because_1 you guys ran into it a while back	2348	A
uh	2348	A
<silence>	2348	A
oh yeah it's not just yeah it's not just TI they they're doing the same thing up here and not just uh in yesterday's newspaper they said um IBM's going through they're going to lay off like fourteen thousand world wide	2348	A
	2348	A
So it's still there unfortunately um	2348	A
<silence>	2348	B
hi	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
no we don't really do anything formal um	2348	B
i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the spending too as well so uh you know i kind of have a handle on it and	2348	B
i just sort of know what we can and can't do and	2348	B
it you know it's worked pretty well i haven't really gotten into any major problems without having something formal	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
well yeah	2348	B
yeah we have uh you know like a typical credit union account for you know just a a basic savings thing and then uh we've got you know the IRA's and CD's and	2348	B
various and sundry you know long term kinds of things	2348	B
how about_1 you	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
um-hum	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
uh	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
right	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
um-hum	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
right	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
 well i know yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah or if you want to take a trip or something that you you plan it but that's where you get the money is	2348	B
yeah that's that's the way we work it	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
uh-huh	2348	B
uh-huh	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
uh-huh	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
oh that's sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then we've got that little cushion in there that	2348	B
you know will either cover it or partially so you know depending on what it is	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah no i never go- like to go into those things that are	2348	B
like you say long term that have penalties and all sorts of other things they	2348	B
uh i i sort of feel like if you leave it there and you don't use it and you sort of don't see it then it's it's safe in a sense	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yes	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
definitely i mean that's a good deal	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
i don't know	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
uh-huh	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah that's a good deal well when you did keep a a budget all the time how strictly did you do that i mean was it real precise or	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
um-hum	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
uh-huh	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
uh-huh	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
 well-	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah i do that too	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
	2348	B
yeah i used to take money out for gas and groceries and things like that and i don't even do that anymore i mean i just don't have that much cash on me	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
um-hum right	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
works pretty good then	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah to some extent i guess so	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
well	2348	B
if we	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah they probably don't have enough to that's right	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah we we're having some problems here too	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
yeah they're still laying off like over in Fort Worth and a lot of other companies too just here and there	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
well yeah that really is scary	2348	B
<silence>	2348	B
	2345	A
okay i think the crime in Dallas is horrendous	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
 compared now to when i first- came here twenty years ago when i came here twenty years ago it was not near as bad as it is now it's terrible now my house has already been broken into once and there was an attempt	2345	A
a second- another time i mean i can't it's horrible i'm afraid	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
no i live well i live in Oak Cliff but uh	2345	A
uh we never had any problem here before we we really did not in my neighborhood we're not wealthy at all know- you know we don't have a rich neighborhood and when they break into our houses they don't get anything	2345	A
much they get a little jewelry and maybe you know a VCR's and it just irritates me to no end that somebody has broken into my house and stolen my things you know just	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
	2345	A
	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
no i hadn't- i hadn't heard that	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
are you serious that is the city-	2345	A
that sounds like the city i worked for the city of Dallas for a while and i do know that they're they can be really strange	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
 drugs they want to- see they take what they do they break in and they take your jewelry and they take it and they sell it they hock it and then they buy drugs i really think it's drugs they want the money for the drugs	2345	A
so i think drugs is the root of it	2345	A
well okay_1 i used to work second shift and when they broke in i was working at night i i work in payroll now and i work days but uh they broke in	2345	A
they knew my hours the police told me evidently they were watching me and they know your hours see that's what so spooky about it	2345	A
	2345	A
and they broke in at night and uh since then i've put in a security light and i've marked everything i you know that i have i	2345	A
put my driver's license number on it ugly too i mean where it could be seen because_1 i don't care don't- i just don't want them_1 to get it and hock it again	2345	A
	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
no not right here i i have never even seen like uh what they call a crack house or anything i wouldn't	2345	A
no there's nothing like that here that i know of now i'm sure there are somewhere in Oak Cliff but i've never seen it we're not in a bad area you know i	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
they've hit they've hit my next door neighbor they hit uh the guy about_1 two or three houses down so they've hit several houses in the neighborhood one of them_1 twice	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
they're just looking	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
just something they kicked my door in they literally- i had a solid wooden door with a dead bolt on it and they backed up and put their foot to it and kicked it in molding and all	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
that's real scary	2345	A
i have a and i my insurance paid to have the contractor come out and i we put in a -another solid door and another dead bolt but it doesn't hold it	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
so does mine now this one does have glass in it	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
	2345	A
uh i don't think there is a solution i i really	2345	A
i really don't know i really don't- and you know the police told me to get a gun and if they if you're here and they try breaking in shoot them_1 now i have never heard policemen telling people to get a gun and shoot people before	2345	A
but that tells you how bad the situation is that tells you how bad it is and there aren't enough police and they they didn't get here till six the next morning i got home at eleven called the police immediately	2345	A
several times my neighbors came over immediately we didn't even know if they were still in the house my neighbor went through looking	2345	A
they advised on the phone that we'll have somebody go through and look now that's terrible and the police did not get here until seven hours later	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
that's darn scary	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
if it's possible i guess i well or is it is it or is the solution legalizing	2345	A
somethings	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
if you legalize it it- uh well you couldn't legalize everything okay i just don't see that you could but if you legalized marijuana	2345	A
and then uh taxed it and everything then everybody'd come out okay i think on that deal	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
i don't even know i really don't know	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
hard drug users	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
yeah	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
and then the thing is keeping them_1 locked up	2345	A
you know they pick them_1 up they lock them_1 up and then they they let them_1 go	2345	A
they don't have anything to keep- and you never get your stuff back you never get your stuff back	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
that's right	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
and they think these are kids- kids- are probably teenagers older teenagers that have been doing this around here	2345	A
they uh they weren't real professional- well we don't know for sure but they hit they took they knew right where to go that's what scares me	2345	A
they went they went right to my jewelry they did not ransack my house they went right to my jewelry box and i had a ring that had my diamonds in it and my grandmother's diamonds in it that i had made and it was worth close to two thousand dollars	2345	A
they got- and they i mean they had pay dirt when they saw that i mean and i couldn't- i worked in the shop then at TI you you know with machinery and i couldn't wear my jewelry i can wear it now i wear everything	2345	A
i don't leave anything home i wear everything you bet but uh	2345	A
they got that and the diamond necklace and stuff so they really hit pay dirt and then they grabbed my VCR also but they didn't just tear it out they very carefully unhooked everything laid everything out you know i mean it was just unbelievable	2345	A
no they left two TV's and one was small they could have easily carried it but the police said they must have been on foot it looked like they were on foot they left my silver my silver was sitting here in a chest	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
well i did	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
yeah yeah	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
well they can they can	2345	A
 no well they can hock it see they take everything to the pawn shops and just hock everything but um	2345	A
i don't know they just hit the jewelry- well i guess if they knew their jewelry they knew their- but they did take some cubic zirconiums too i had a ring that they looked awfully real	2345	A
and i did have a ring that that wasn't real and they took that you know and i said	2345	A
they just grabbed	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
they just grabbed but boy they sure hit pay dirt with that one ring luckily my insurance you know reimbursed me but i can't replace those diamonds	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
you know	2345	A
to have and that had my grandmother's stones in it you know so oh i was sick	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
but i still haven't bought a gun	2345	A
<silence>	2345	A
	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
compared- compared to what	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
do you live in do you live near downtown	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well-	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
	2345	B
hum well i live i i live in in north	2345	B
west Garland actually west- about a mile south of one ninety so we're really quite far north and the house we just moved into a house that has lots of windows and i course i have a friend- Dallas policeman that lives right behind me so i don't know if that'll do any good but	2345	B
uh it it's interesting though that you've been broken into uh you must you must look at this whole mess a lot different did you see today that they the the police commanders got a pay raise and the the regular folks didn't	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
it just on the news i was just watching a little of it just	2345	B
before you called it uh and they cutback- and they cutback on overtime and they have to take electric clocks home and you wonder what that does to the fighting crime if- if they had an electric clock on their desk they were supposed to take it home to save energy	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
 i'm serious uh Doug Clark's on channel eight	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
what what what do you think why why people breaking into your house	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
hum	2345	B
what time of day are they breaking in	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
uh	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well are you uh you said you're not in a in a rich neighborhood but are there are there obviously um	2345	B
drug people in the area	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
do you think they just kind of hit your house at random or but they were going down the street	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
so they	2345	B
okay so they're really just looking for	2345	B
a nice enough house to find something to steal	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
oh that's scary because_1 everybody feels you're supposed to have dead bolts	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well my the front door on the house i have has uh glass in it	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well i- i wonder you know you know it i don't know this is tough but i guess the issue is is if it's drug people what's the solution	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well that	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
um-hum	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
um-hum	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well that that's real scary	2345	B
but is the is the solution uh cutting off drug supply	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
or-	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
or is it	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah or yeah uh do you see that these people you know are they going to if if you cut supply it's going to raise the price	2345	B
or if you uh	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well how how expensive is um how expensive is marijuana it's not very expensive is it	2345	B
but i mean the people that are i'd be curious to if the people that are wouldn't you think the people that are breaking in are probably	2345	B
are probably crack that have got a pretty high because_1 i would think a hundred dollars worth of marijuana i don't know what it costs but	2345	B
i should think that'd be more than a lot more than just ordinary recreation it would be interesting to see if to the problem is is is what do you lock them_1 up for you know	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
but they don't have enough proof them_1	2345	B
and then we got to raise-	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well we had interesting enough we had a in in Garland before we moved we had some neighborhood kids came by and stole uh uh drill and our saw and and i had them_1 marked and uh	2345	B
we called the police about a week later the guy caught these kids riding a motor- um	2345	B
a motor scooter or a a go it was a go-cart in the in the alley	2345	B
and he got to talking to the kids and and we recovered the drill and the saw it was but uh it it's one of those you know it was uh not a not a real expensive neighborhood	2345	B
uh but it's it's interesting that the the motivation and the question is what's the motivation not to steal and i i guess that's what bothers it's like the criminal you know if somebody says well let's lock him up for life well	2345	B
how should he you know what bothers me is the incentive that he's if you if you know you're going to be in there for life why should you just be good	2345	B
but if you if you say i'm not going to let you out till you have a skill and we think you're reformed well that's not how they do it they let them_1 out when they time is served i	2345	B
	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
hum	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
in your	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
oh my	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
 everything of value	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well did they did you take your TV	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah but who buys silver anymore	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well yeah but have you bought a place setting lately- i have a niece that's getting married	2345	B
and uh she's not even um selecting a silver pattern because_1 it's i've forgotten my wife was telling me what the cost is just incredible to you know a place setting is is	2345	B
i don't know two or three hundred dollars or something i mean your silver probably is worth a lot but uh what are they going to do walk down the street and tell everybody what would you like to buy uh a	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well how would they know i mean they they'd have to be pretty sophisticated	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
no and and and yeah how to put a value on a ring that you'd made	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
yeah	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
that is scary	2345	B
<silence>	2345	B
well see that's the thing scares me about it is um who gets shot with the guns they say that a large number of the homicides are people that know each other	2345	B
that uh i've forgot what the percentage- forty or fifty percent it's surprisingly high that people that shoot each other know them_1 i mean it's not like you know a	2345	B
well in the normal in- in the normal route of way we do things how about_1 the ladies go first	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
all right i'm uh live in Plano Texas and uh um	2383	B
uh today we're not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today	2383	B
so uh i mean when you when you take uh	2383	B
uh professionals and put them_1 in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to	2383	B
to get that major subject in line something's wrong so i think here in Texas mainly that the the	2383	B
they're not serious they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so i'm not i'm more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but	2383	B
uh it's just a shame to me that- that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being	2383	B
i have a i have a a real issue with that um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test	2383	B
that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states then that's saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in Texas and i have a real concern with about that	2383	B
um um matter of fact i'm very content to send my daughter out- out of state to college in in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything and then uh so i'm	2383	B
my my opinion i think- i think there's a big concern uh hopefully- hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh	2383	B
i don't know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
um-hum	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
exactly i- i was astonished to find out that that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed	2383	B
half- they don't even a lot of the school systems don't even uh the kids nowadays don't even know what what the President's uh Fitness Education Program's all about they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school	2383	B
and yeah and uh i'll i talked to a thirteen year old last night who's uh goes to uh	2383	B
one of the Plano schools- high schools or or junior highs i guess and she said that that she had a a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she chose to take weight lifting	2383	B
over the regular gym i mean give me a break i mean the- the- the kids sit there and they drink- and they drink Cokes and eat popcorn for for for lunch- for lunch and then go out there and lift weights	2383	B
and don't learn anything it's just a real i have a real problem with the whole system they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
um-hum	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
i used to	2383	B
i used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level	2383	B
i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they would- that she was paid true she was young you know but still it's the principle of course if she got her Master's degree it'd all be different but uh	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
	2383	B
oh taxes lord forbid- forbid- lord forbid taxes goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and give to the teachers we might have such a problem	2383	B
 maybe i should run for office huh	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
this is true	2383	B
that's funny that's funny	2383	B
	2383	B
well that's about all i have here	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
yes ma'am	2383	B
<silence>	2383	B
surely i've enjoyed it bye bye	2383	B
	2383	B
<silence>	2383	A
{alrighty} um	2383	A
well i uh have- have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so i'm really just starting to get involved in uh in what's out there and how they do things um	2383	A
as- as far as the system as a whole i really don't see a a problem with it i do see a problem with graduating people that that can't read and are not	2383	A
you know productive in society or productive to themselves and uh i think that's the main problem at this point	2383	A
how about_1 yourself	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
right	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
that's true	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up	2383	A
and uh and not really get down to teaching what's important	2383	A
teaching these kids you know how really the basics is what it comes down to	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
is that right	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
huh	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
i remember	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
and talk yeah	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
huh	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
yeah then it comes down to what you said before though about them being uh some of the lowest paid public you know public service	2383	A
employees that there are and yet they're so important	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
right	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
well you know it's hard though because then you start talking taxes and uh that's bad word	2383	A
	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
 there's an idea	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
run on that then no income taxes in Texas huh i'm in Texas too so	2383	A
<silence>	2383	A
well gee	2383	A
well me too i uh i think we both agree there's some problems there but	2383	A
we'll small- maybe do our small part to fix them_1 up	2383	A
all right you too bye	2383	A
	2383	A
<silence>	2307	B
oh okay	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
uh-huh	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
okay	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
right getting uh close to Mexico or	2307	B
all right and no	2307	B
and not the humidity i usually think of the South as being very humid	2307	B
Dallas is	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
uh-huh	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
i see	2307	B
oh	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh you have to get used to hills	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh that's good	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh that's good and what what is uh what is the temperature like down there now	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh that's pretty warm already	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh is that right	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
actually last year uh um about a week ago at the same time last	2307	B
year um we had hit the actually uh nineties for about four days which is very unusual for this area at this time of year um what we're having right now is a lot of overcast	2307	B
you know a lot of days with uh drizzle or uh actually we've had a thunderstorm But about this time of the year March blows a lot of winds here and it's a very windy month	2307	B
um but right now we're in about the sixties which is is fairly comfortable	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
yes we do they peak on Friday so if you have a chance to be here Friday or somewhere- somewhere around there that that's the best time to see them and they don't last too long you know	2307	B
yeah and uh then after after this month it'll quickly get get hot you know i mean March- April May it has a lot of rain uh May has quite a bit of rain and uh	2307	B
by May we're hitting in the eighties sometimes even low- low nineties uh but we don't really get the bad humidity here until July and August those are our worst months	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
right right so is everything in uh bloom down there now is it warm enough i guess all the trees are	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh right	2307	B
air quality index yeah	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
right	2307	B
is that like a pollen sort of a pollen count yeah yeah well we're just starting now like i said the cherry blossoms are out forsythias are out uh no tulips yet so we're probably a few weeks behind	2307	B
uh you know down uh that area being that south you know and uh	2307	B
that lasts everything's in bloom you know everything's green here till about October and then we lose it all	2307	B
	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
i see	2307	B
	2307	B
i think it was in December one time and it was probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather but in the fifties and i was shocked	2307	B
to see people all bundled up with scarves and hats as though it were you know in the twenties because here in the fifties people have sweaters so you know i guess it's what you become acclimated to yes	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
right	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
 yeah	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
yeah yes	2307	B
right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here i'm i'm uh formerly a Pennsylvanian and i have to say that i enjoy it	2307	B
that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i don't know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to is what what you enjoy that's right	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
right	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
	2307	B
no	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
oh is that right	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
ah that's interesting	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
yeah yeah so i guess that once they're used to the wide open spaces huh that that that yeah that that's interesting so	2307	B
<silence>	2307	B
yeah i think i'll take the area with trees huh yeah yeah	2307	B
	2307	B
okay well nice talking to you alright well- bye bye	2307	B
	2307	B
<silence>	2307	A
okay well now i'm from Dallas	2307	A
well actually i'm living in Dallas i'm not from Dallas i uh was living in West Texas before this uh which is a very dry arid	2307	A
well obviously it's it's kind of a desert area	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum real close New Mexico anyway	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
well he Dallas is and that's since i've moved up here now so i'm starting to get a little bit of this but	2307	A
i'll tell you uh considering well okay i've uh mostly throughout my life i've lived in in the smaller uh parts of of Texas and so moving to Dallas i was a little worried about the traffic	2307	A
um	2307	A
the differences in terrain because uh you know Dallas is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new car and it had uh had standard- standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before	2307	A
right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a a a lot of ice and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was one or two days of ice the entire winter	2307	A
i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of snow here and there but i mean i couldn't have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
oh well today it was probably in the eighties um well yeah we've had uh we've had several days in the eighties in fact i'll tell you what last night i came real close to turning on the air conditioning i didn't do it	2307	A
i didn't do it but i came close	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
i would imagine yes	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
right	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
well i heard the uh that um Washington DC has actually got the cherry blossoms blooming so	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
so that's	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
hum well yeah that's i heard that	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum well that's that's sort of what happens here except uh we may start a little earlier and end a little later but uh	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
yeah they've been they've actually been going at it for a good you know four weeks now i would think um	2307	A
you know in fact it's kind of funny uh you know you're watching the newscast i don't know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you what's all in the air you know the fungus and the the trees you know yeah well	2307	A
but mostly it's you know allergy type index and it's been like like i said about four weeks now that uh they've had um	2307	A
multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so that's a real good sign that that the trees are in bloom and the flowers are in bloom and stuff like that	2307	A
pollen count yeah exactly	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
yeah	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
well it's it's um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited	2307	A
winter um now south of here uh like in Houston i did uh even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter	2307	A
and you know the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties you know when it got down in the sixties you were cold down there	2307	A
yeah	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
yeah that	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
oh yes it's a big difference i have a one of my friends is from Kansas City and uh he has lived down here for like eleven years but he refuses	2307	A
to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean he's the only person i know	2307	A
that in thirty degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know it's still not cold cold here uh compared to what he's used to so	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
well i think that's true yeah	2307	A
although there's you know there's you don't ever want to get	2307	A
too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of trees around and then i lived out like i said in West Texas where it's desert and there's not a lot of trees and that's the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated	2307	A
seeing you know no trees i mean it's just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles and miles you know	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
well now that's that's not necessarily true there are people that are born out there that can't stand it here	2307	A
they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so it's got to be somewhat true i mean	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
exactly	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
yeah i see i wouldn't have thought that from the beginning but uh i've talked to so many people about it that it makes sense now i guess	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
hum i agree i agree of course i wouldn't mind having an area with ocean but we won't get involved in that either	2307	A
yeah yeah that sounds good	2307	A
<silence>	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
okay well	2307	A
it was yeah nice talking to you too um-hum bye-bye	2307	A
	2307	A
<silence>	2343	A
do you have a favorite type of music you listen to	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
 okay	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh i tend to favor uh rock and roll mostly from the sixties and seventies	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
yeah i listen to KGPS classic rock	2343	A
	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
right	2343	A
uh yeah i'm in Plano	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh do you play any instruments	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
never have	2343	A
uh well i took piano lessons in fourth grade once for one semester i'll never forget Mrs Burkhalter	2343	A
she had that Nazi mentality	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh in Milwaukee	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
chopsticks	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
okay	2343	A
well i have no idea what that is	2343	A
i just know i hated it	2343	A
but i took up trumpet after that and ended up playing in the University of Wisconsin marching band	2343	A
which was fun	2343	A
it uh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
oh we had a great time in the band my uh director was heavy into the big bands so we played a lot of tunes by uh Glen Miller and Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey and people like that	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
so it was a lot of fun plus i got to get to go to all the uh athletic events free	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
well which uh sixties uh rock bands do you like the best	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
right	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
is that right	2343	A
um	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh yeah certainly but uh	2343	A
right uh-huh	2343	A
yeah i think i've got all those	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
um	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
oh i started my uh music collection in college when i started winning radio contests	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
well they would uh tell you to call in and be caller number nine and win	2343	A
so i had a touch tone telephone in college and uh i just started calling in and winning all kinds of contests	2343	A
i had forty record albums before i even had a stereo to play them to play them on	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
i ended up winning about uh two hundred and thirty radio contests in two school years	2343	A
so i accumulated my record collection mostly from that	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
it was	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
yeah well that was in Madison i i won about four times a week	2343	A
it doesn't have near the population that Dallas has the contests here are a lot more competitive	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
um	2343	A
yeah but not the same type of contests um	2343	A
they have contests on the radio in the morning and i think i won one of the movie mystery contests one time	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
they sent me uh a small flag in the mail that which- which had postage due	2343	A
	2343	A
no	2343	A
it was a	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
it wasn't much of a victory actually i did win tickets to the to a Chicago and a Beach Boys concert	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh yeah they were uh they were very good i was impressed	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
every now and then i'll go ahead and make another tape and uh record a bunch of uh old tunes like the Loving Spoonful and Grateful Dead something from the Birds Rolling Stones	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
i enjoy listening to those old tunes they don't play a lot of that stuff on the radio any more you have to pick the right station	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
yeah i	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
i uh yeah i haven't made any kind of effort to keep up on uh recent music especially in rock and roll	2343	A
there's not just too much uh new stuff that's well	2343	A
it's not as creative	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
and the lyrics aren't as uh	2343	A
inspiring if you want to call it that	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
yeah lot of pop music out that just isn't very thrilling	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
certainly is just turn on MTV any night	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
they'll be playing the latest of Bon Jovi or White Snake or	2343	A
groups like that	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
yeah	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
i always like the easier listening rock the the Crosby Stills Nash and Young Eagles uh in more recent uh Billy Joel very talented	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
Z Z Top is uh different very creative they- they really uh made uh quite a transition	2343	A
they used to be almost a country band	2343	A
uh playing such	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
yeah such classics as La Grange and Touche	2343	A
and	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
right	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
but uh they they really did change	2343	A
all of a sudden they became a top forty type group appealing to the younger crowd	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh very good videos yeah i'm kind of impressed	2343	A
quite creative and appealing to the younger crowd	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
to the pop audience i guess you'd call it that	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
Robert Palmer's got some creative- pretty creative videos- videos out too	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
oh yeah and there are some that are that get artsy to a point like Steve Winwood	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
well who's uh who's who's popular now with the uh contemporary Christian music	2343	A

<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A

<silence>	2343	A
well i don't think i'd ever make a song writer	2343	A
	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
yeah well some people get lucky and i guess if you're persistent enough sometimes it works out	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
uh-huh	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
well what station plays uh that type of music	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A

<silence>	2343	A
all right	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
right okay	2343	A
<silence>	2343	A
okay yeah i still feel like every time if i ever feel like reminiscing over the old stuff i'll go ahead and throw on a sixties tape	2343	A
get something from from the Guess Who or	2343	A
	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
um most frequently i listen to contemporary Christian music but i like all forms	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B

<silence>	2343	B
KGPS in Dallas	2343	B

i uh i enjoy mainly the old the older rock and roll tunes rather than	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
a lot of the new stuff is the lyrics are so repetitive	2343	B
that i just kind of get lost in it	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
it doesn't seem to be	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
yeah	2343	B
yeah some of the tunes used to you know you felt like you needed to go out and do something about it	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B

when uh	2343	B
Led Zeppelin was real big and everybody i tried to you know really go the whole way and i couldn't go with even	2343	B
with most of Led Zeppelin's music i didn't enjoy it	2343	B
and some of the stuff you know the classics they were fine but	2343	B
some of it was just too heavy even then	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
uh-huh	2343	B
yeah	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
yeah	2343	B

i uh	2343	B
like i said i listen to primarily contemporary Christian	2343	B
and uh	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
but i spend enough time on scan that i hear what it- what is still on the radio well i don't know	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
oh probably Amy Grant is the biggest one yeah she's even she's got a song right now that playing on a a few of the other stations it's called Baby Baby it's	2343	B
it's neat when you think about how she wrote it and stuff otherwise the lyrics are kind of	2343	B
you know it's just like oh i love you and i you know this that and the other but she write she wrote when she was talking to her baby	2343	B
and if you've got a baby i mean it's kind of neat thinking about it talking up to your baby and to to an infant	2343	B
so it it makes it neater but	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
	2343	B
my secretary has tried to be a song writer	2343	B

<silence>	2343	B
uh ninety four point one is KLTY	2343	B

they spend a lot of time with uh	2343	B
oh this	2343	B
preaching kind of stuff	2343	B
so i like music i like listening to music so i don't usually listen to KCBI	2343	B
and then there's another one called Journey that's somewhere in between the two of those it's in between ninety and ninety four	2343	B
i think it's ninety two	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
ninety four point one is fun	2343	B
i mean it's it's	2343	B
it's mainly	2343	B
um just family oriented stuff i mean yeah it's very its definitely Christian but it's not it's not hymns	2343	B
	2343	B
you know it's not Amazing Grace every other time	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
yeah	2343	B
<silence>	2343	B
<silence>	2396	A
well what kind of pets do you have	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
are you- you're married	2396	A
and newly married	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
oh	2396	A
	2396	A
sounds like us	2396	A
only we started off ours with we had we had pets before we had kids that's why i thought when you were saying you know we're going to have one in two months or something	2396	A
perhaps that you were newly married	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
hm	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yes	2396	A
that's easier	2396	A
are you going to get a dog	2396	A
that's what that's what we have is two dogs	2396	A
big dogs	2396	A
well our first both they were our child substitutes before we had our children	2396	A
and we got one right after we got married we both decided we needed a dog we went to the pound and we got this mutt	2396	A
and he's been it was alright before we had our kids it was he's just he's a real hyper dog he barks and and jumps a lot	2396	A
so we had him for a year and then my husband decided after we had him a year that he'd wanted for his entire life to have a Siberian husky	2396	A
and i think why didn't you tell me a year ago when we got the other dog	2396	A
	2396	A
you know this was your dream of your life to have a Siberian husky	2396	A
so we got the other one	2396	A
for him and to keep the first one company when we were at work all day	2396	A
so we have the the old the older dog's a male and he's	2396	A
he weighs about forty pounds and then Pepper is a year younger and she weighs	2396	A
about seventy pounds	2396	A
so we have two massive dogs	2396	A
go through lots of dog food	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
absolutely	2396	A
i never wanted my husband wanted indoor dogs because he'd grown up with them but i can't stand it indoors	2396	A
i don't they shed and you know the mud and	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
oh yeah	2396	A
there for me dogs are meant to be outside	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
goodness	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
oh my goodness	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
sure	2396	A
	2396	A
they're going to run you down	2396	A
	2396	A
goodness and all of them were in the house	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
hm	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
i see	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
hm	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
okay	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
oh when i was growing up my folks we had fox terriers which are little bitty	2396	A
they weigh about ten pounds	2396	A
and so we had we had one for a long time	2396	A
and then oh gosh when i was about ten or eleven i guess my parents decided that dogs would be a good way to teach reproduction so then they went out and got a female	2396	A
 and then we started having puppies and she had	2396	A
she had four or five litters she always had to look we always kept them in the house when they had the when she when the babies were little	2396	A
and the rest of the time they were outside they had a big we had a big uh kind of a play house and part of that was their dog house it was kind of cordoned off	2396	A
so they had a place to stay out there and then they had the yard and they had a little run that uh they kept them in when we were trying to do stuff in the back yard and didn't want them out	2396	A
but we had the same kind of situation at one point in time we had the mother the one of her last	2396	A
her next to last litter we kept we had one the one we never could get rid of	2396	A
	2396	A
and we have him	2396	A
and then our female she had another litter we didn't think she was we thought she was too old to get pregnant again	2396	A
turned out she wasn't	2396	A
and uh she had her litter i guess her last litter had like	2396	A
four and two of them survived and then she didn't make it	2396	A
two days after the they were born she had a she died	2396	A
she had some kind of an infection from it all she was just too old	2396	A
we had to feed the puppies we had to get up night and day with those just like with a baby	2396	A
and feed- and bottle feed them	2396	A
and we just	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
oh	2396	A
um	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
weren't they messy too well did she did the mother survive	2396	A
so you could still feed it but she kept them clean	2396	A
oh she didn't she didn't do something	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
um	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yuck	2396	A
oh goodness	2396	A
	2396	A
what's a mess	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
that was like oh boy they are so messy when they're little too	2396	A
we were giving them a bath about every other day- boy we were giving them a bath at least once a day but they were so horrible	2396	A
because_1 they would roll and everything and oh	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
	2396	A
	2396	A
oh i guess i had fish for a while when i was a kid too i had a fish tank	2396	A
and i had a few until	2396	A
well it wasn't really an aquarium it was an old you know how you used to have these um	2396	A
this was a box and it was originally it was it was made like an aquarium i guess except it was smaller but it was its original use was to put in the refrigerator on the shelf had a little spigot at one end	2396	A
and you could get water out of it you know keep cold water	2396	A
	2396	A
we outgrew the need for that	2396	A
and so i used it for an aquarium	2396	A
	2396	A
it worked except the fish could swim	2396	A
it wasn't tall enough i kept the if i didn't keep the the lid on it the fish would uh swim out and flop on the floor sometimes	2396	A
	2396	A
flip out of the thing but	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
those have been i mean and our dogs now our dogs with our kids i have two little kids three and a half and one and a half	2396	A
so we built the dog run down the length of our uh back yard	2396	A
because the kids were getting- i mean we couldn't even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldn't let him go out in the back yard	2396	A
because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little	2396	A
you know they just even walking by him they'd knock- they'd knock him down and the whole the whole back yard had poop in it all the time	2396	A
it was a mess for the little one so	2396	A
now we have a back yard and a dog run	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
oh that'll be nice	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah back and forth uh	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
three and a half	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
or probably he or she is old enough to where they won't tease it too you know poke on it too much	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
because_1 that's hard ours our kids have gotten	2396	A
over it with the dogs behind it they have the the run it's kind of like a wire run	2396	A
so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy the little one still he just wants to poke	2396	A
my older one our older son's pretty good about it he'll pet the dog you know	2396	A
and and he's three and a half like you're saying and he he's pretty good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into	2396	A
but boy the little one still just wants to poke and	2396	A
and see if the dog will back off you know and	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
yeah i think it is too it's gonna get better	2396	A
	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
i think if we didn't have pets if we didn't already have our dog and cat now we wouldn't get them because the kids are so little	2396	A
i think when they're really little like the the eighteen month old it's not fair to the animal	2396	A
because_1 the kids are so miserable to them	2396	A
if they're out very much	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
that's	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah and not get mad at the kid that's the other thing too that	2396	A
i i always felt Pepper the the Siberian husky is really sweet she can i think the kids could walk up and	2396	A
they could literally probably stand on her back and she wouldn't even she'd kind of look at them like what are you doing now	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
she's real good natured about it	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
well i think that's about all my pet stories right now so	2396	A
	2396	A
 okay well it's been nice talking to you	2396	A
<silence>	2396	A
okay bye-bye	2396	A
	2396	A
<silence>	2396	B
at the present time we have none we intend to uh purchase a pup in two months	2396	B

<silence>	2396	B
	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
goodness	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B

<silence>	2396	B
yeah they're big dogs	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah Are they primarily outdoor dogs	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
and the scratches and the smell and the uh wherever yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
i firmly believe that large dogs are meant to be outside we had Danes when i was a child and um	2396	B
and we had our Danes in the house	2396	B
but i mean it's almost dangerous to have them in the house	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
and uh we went through a time period that we had three Danes	2396	B
we had	2396	B
yeah and we had we had had a litter	2396	B
and she had uh had thirteen puppies	2396	B
eight of which survived and uh	2396	B
and she we ended up keeping one of those puppies	2396	B
we had the mom the dad and one of the puppies and it was horrendous	2396	B
we wound up getting um get getting rid of the mom selling the puppy and just keeping the dad because dad was the favorite one anyway	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B

<silence>	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
oh	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
we had a Schnauzer that got milk fever right after the babies were born and we had to feed all their babies- feed all the babies there were five and there were four of them that survived	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah she did survive	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
no	2396	B
no she didn't even she did not even take the sack- this is the laziest dog that ever lived	2396	B
when she had these puppies she crawled up onto my mother's stomach in the middle of the bed	2396	B
had the puppies and woke up my mother	2396	B
to cut the sacks off she didn't even lick the sacks off laziest dog on earth she never she never nursed them she never cleaned them she never did anything to them they were like she- they didn't exist	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
 yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah they just poop and it's yeah they	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
like a nice aquarium	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
oh yeah	2396	B

	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B

<silence>	2396	B
the cat was always happy	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
uh we've uh we'll probably get real small Cairn terrier	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
and it'll probably be an indoor outdoor dog	2396	B
but see my my oldest is five and a half and so she can take part in some of the uh	2396	B
responsibilities a three and a half year old really can't quite take part of many of the responsibilities maybe feeding them	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
oh she's she's got respect for animals thank goodness	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
i think that's eighteen months	2396	B
i mean i think that's just kids trying to figure out you know what's going to happen and it will happen again and again and again	2396	B
	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
<silence>	2396	B
yeah yeah it has to be a real uh mellow kind of animal that can	2396	B
uh	2396	B
survive it and child	2396	B
 yeah	2396	B
well that's what you i mean that's what you need in a pet if your going to have small children too	2396	B

yeah maybe so we'll start listening to children's music	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
yeah there are	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
oh uh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
oh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
that yeah that sounds really cute	2387	A
uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb and i said then when when it's born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe it'll comfort her you know when she's fussy and stuff	2387	A
what	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
huh	2387	A
how strange	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
uh-huh {babbly} i'll say that is well we'll have to keep up with that then	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
huh	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
right yeah have something to rebel against	2387	A
<silence>	2387	A
yeah that's good yeah variety is good	2387	A
well i guess that covers it It was real good talking to you	2387	A
um well thanks um bye	2387	A
	2387	A
	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i don't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but it's the the music i enjoy the most how about you	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
right	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
uh-huh	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot there's uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time but there's one in particular that	2387	B
is on both AM and FM so i can listen to it without uh worrying it's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else	2387	B
because_1 naturally that isn't their taste	2387	B
at this point in time anyway	2387	B
are are you involved in music	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
	2387	B
 well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and	2387	B
my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing so um i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style so	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
	2387	B
no i well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious	2387	B
it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning now i do like folk song um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around	2387	B
but um but the more popular music i don't care for usually	2387	B
um even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular	2387	B
rock and roll kind of thing	2387	B
although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think i'm young again	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
isn't that the truth it's funny in fact it's interesting to me that so many of the songs now i grew up	2387	B
in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back	2387	B
and you you don't hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but it's the same stuff	2387	B
um which is always kind of funny um and i remember my older sister i have a sister who's sixteen years older and at the time that i was	2387	B
a teenager late teenager i guess i can't remember the year Smoke Gets In Your Eyes became popular i think it was done by maybe the Platters or something	2387	B
then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a a version of you know a song then and she said it's very similar but they've changed a little bit she said i like the original version better	2387	B
	2387	B
right right it does indeed	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
uh-huh	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
yes now that there there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations uh the problem- problem that i found um in this area is that the	2387	B
there there is inconsistency in the quality	2387	B
here if you get someone who's very good at selecting it's okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality	2387	B
you know uh i live in the uh Washington DC area Rockville Maryland	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
yeah and it	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
uh-huh and i i you know there's so much available that i don't understand why they do that but um	2387	B
now my children have have sometimes um well they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church and um and	2387	B
they- when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard and you know i enjoy that	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
oh wow	2387	B
yeah that's nice so is your husband a singer	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
right yeah	2387	B
well that's a good thing to do	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
that's nice uh well do you have children	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
well wonderful that'll be a musician	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
 oh there's some wonderful Christian uh children's tapes	2387	B
you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um	2387	B
i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um	2387	B
very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy	2387	B
um there's one that's um a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect	2387	B
and uh she's playing the piano and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and it's really cute	2387	B
yeah	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
yeah right	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
yeah well do you know something because i have always played classical music	2387	B
uh or classical style it's not always classical as you know the official uh word might go but um	2387	B
even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i when i was around the house i played that music too	2387	B
when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale	2387	B
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodious in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny	2387	B
right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music	2387	B
the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um	2387	B
this same child um really listened to- to more um {ballady} or um	2387	B
pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the uh real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to	2387	B
and i i never i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore	2387	B
right but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice i like that	2387	B
yeah	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby	2387	B
bye-bye	2387	B
<silence>	2387	B
	2390	A
okay um do you have a credit card	2390	A
	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i know i've got one um i i did have two and	2390	A
the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one	2390	A
um	2390	A
i don't know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right up	2390	A
and now i've after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and i'm still paying it off	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i don't know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is it's a pain paying it off	2390	A
i i don't i don't know um	2390	A
i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and i've put- saved up enough money where i'm going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars	2390	A
but um	2390	A
i don't know i never i never liked loans a lot so i'm not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i know it's easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things	2390	A
it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don't	2390	A
don't really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes	2390	A
even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know	2390	A
you got to be they say you have to dress for success	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
 how many credit cards do you have	2390	A
that's pretty good	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah my oh my husband won't even put his name on it i don't believe in those	2390	A
it's like but but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it	2390	A
because you've got to have a credit card to rent a car	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yep that's right- up here at some stores- if it's if you're not in your home town you have to show them a credit card	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if that's why they're taking it i mean i don't know how fair that is	2390	A
but i don't know um	2390	A
yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah thirteen that's not bad	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express you're really it's not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that it's really expensive isn't it	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i've never had one	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
oh	2390	A
	2390	A
that's good	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah because it's uh	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i know especially if your uh	2390	A
your reimbursement didn't come through	2390	A
from your company because i know they i don't know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and	2390	A
you can use that i don't know why you can't use other credit cards for business that way	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
American Express	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards	2390	A
 you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa	2390	A
i bet you there- i bet you there are people that do that	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
 you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other	2390	A
they- i think they charge more for cash advances so	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
well it yeah you can't get cash advances	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
oh	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
oh well no uh it i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually- eventually	2390	A
no it doesn't	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
 be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i know i don't	2390	A
credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who's who's got a victim of impulse buying	2390	A
like unfair advertising or something	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
oh wow	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something	2390	A
that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we always- and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders	2390	A
yeah it's it's the thing if if a business is taking a credit card they're really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
because it is a four percent that they take	2390	A
three or four percent	2390	A
i don't know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank	2390	A
i used to take it off the deposit	2390	A
 you do have to take it off your deposit	2390	A
yeah so it is a a service that they're offering	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i i know should own stock	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
there instead of these uh	2390	A
uh banks going that are folding but	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it's got to be billions of dollars	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
that's uh probably true	2390	A
i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan	2390	A
and then there's all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards	2390	A
	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
that's personal	2390	A
maybe they don't	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had taken- confiscate her credit cards	2390	A
i mean i don't know it's probably they're always saying the women are doing are the spending ones	2390	A
but i haven't heard one- uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man	2390	A
well i don't know um i i definitely want to get mine- up mine paid off month to month like i used to	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
and just as soon as i get it paid off i'll probably get laid off	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
terrible can't afford my credit card anymore	2390	A
<silence>	2390	A
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh who doesn't have credit cards	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh i know it's it's Christmas is the worst time for- i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh yeah uh-huh	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh that's good that's really good	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh i know i know	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
no	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards	2390	B
and they've just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them	2390	B
it's it it's just unreal	2390	B
i guess	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh of course	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time	2390	B
you know uh get- please get- get- get- and you're already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff	2390	B
you know they just try to uh to to get you to get- uh have their credit card and um you know uh six- half a dozen isn't enough	2390	B
oh i have one we well we have- we have one one Master Card	2390	B
and	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
yes you do uh-huh yes you do yes you do and that- that-	2390	B
uh down here uh you have to have a credit- uh you just can't live without it	2390	B
because down here they don't take a check unless you got credit card and driver's license identification	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah uh it's it's just a another form of identification you know just to	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh yes oh yeah they can	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
uh they're all well ours is ours is through our our credit union and it's thirteen so it's	2390	B
that's not that's really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme- high	2390	B
it's it's uh	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
is it i i don't know we don't- uh we don't	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
my husband has one for to- for uh for business	2390	B
it's a company card	2390	B
but he's never had to use it so we don't get any get anything uh for it	2390	B
i mean we we- we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but but so far he's never had to use it so we don't know anything about the billing	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
do they uh uh ooh	2390	B
that could get you in awful lot of trouble	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
i don't- i don't know i think it's uh just a lot of companies prefer American	2390	B
yeah i i don't know if it's easy for them to get or or or what but um	2390	B
uh but i guess it's it's run so much different from the other ones	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
hum	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh i i i'm sure there are i mean uh	2390	B
you take	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh gee oh gee oh	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
do they um it's it's some cards you- you can do that and some cards you can't down here	2390	B
i think it just depends on what the what the banks will take	2390	B
plus	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh so on on uh on some cards	2390	B
uh-huh well i saying through my bank they they since they have their own card they don't like to give advances through other for other cards	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
that that doesn't solve anything	2390	B
that just	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
because_1 it's still there	2390	B
it's just some place else now	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh yeah store credit cards	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa	2390	B
because i i had a i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while	2390	B
and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
so i i cut- i cut that thing up	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
uh-huh	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh really	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
ooh	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
uh i didn't know	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
wow	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh how awful	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
well but everybody's really trying to you know it's become a real national problem credit card debt	2390	B
and and i we've really cut	2390	B
oh	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
it it is it is it they- uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt	2390	B
and what they're talking about is credit cards	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
uh-huh	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
i don't know if they count uh	2390	B
mortgages as personal debt	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
i don't i'm not sure that they do i think uh	2390	B
what they're talking about like is uh credit cards and other junk and loan car loans things like that	2390	B
because uh	2390	B
boy i know people who kids- people right out of college the credit card people like to get you	2390	B
because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real trouble	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
	2390	B
<silence>	2390	B
oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic	2390	B
	2386	A
well Patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill and then i remembered that i didn't make a call last night and i thought i'd make one tonight	2386	A
<silence>	2386	A
that's what i did with mine for a long time put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up	2386	A
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat	2386	A
<silence>	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
i like it	2386	A
<silence>	2386	A
no it's just as boring	2386	A
	2386	A
i read a book while i'm doing it but i was doing that on the exercise bike	2386	A
i feel like i'm getting a little better of a workout and i'm losing more weight on this than i had on the other and my legs you know how okay i'm going to turn forty this summer i was getting all dimpled up	2386	A
 and those are going away	2386	A
so that's real good	2386	A
we got it at a little bit of an incline	2386	A
<silence>	2386	A
uh this one yeah this is five hundred	2386	A
i know they get cheaper but i don't know uh-huh	2386	A
<silence>	2386	A
well i hope so	2386	A
	2386	A
 yeah i didn't buy it really my husband bought it because we we'd	2386	A
we'd never get out and go walking or anything and we go to the lake and we ski and swim in the summer but	2386	A

it says	2386	B
when we have enough calls from you you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem	2386	B

<silence>	2360	B
it it doesn't start until seven o'clock our time so we still got another hour	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
are you all behind- what time is it there it's six o'clock here now	2360	B
seven o'clock so you all are behind us	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
but uh	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah makes it so late well we're fixing to go on daylight saving time uh next this next weekend	2360	B
so we have to run our clocks up forward an hour and i sure do hate to loose that hour of sleep in the morning	2360	B
	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
well i guess like i said my favorite show what's your favorite shows or you like the news formats	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah i like uh the true life adventures too	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
i i don't uh watch too much of the of the uh network shows i all i like to watch uh	2360	B
let's see some of the the uh prime time shows that i like to watch like i said or other news formats but then every once in a while i'll watch Star Search	2360	B
uh	2360	B
but uh	2360	B
not too many of the situation comedies do i care for	2360	B
and i'm definitely not a soap fan	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah or uh i	2360	B
yeah and i like uh Totally Hidden Video	2360	B
and uh Super- uh what is it uh	2360	B
uh	2360	B
Bloopers and Super- Practical Jokes	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
but um	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
i don't know how people stay at home and watch soaps and get involved in them but	2360	B
i guess plenty of people do	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah in fact i think you can even uh order a magazine that keeps you up to date every day of what happened on every particular soap in case you miss it	2360	B
but uh	2360	B
that that's not real life to me so	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
well i enjoyed talking with you and	2360	B
and how how's you all's weather up there you cold	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah	2360	B
well you	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah did you have a good Easter	2360	B
yeah we did too	2360	B
i told my wife i sure do wish they'd gave us Monday off rather than Friday off	2360	B
because_1 Sunday was really busy	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
yeah company and then we went and visited the daughter and and uh didn't get i don't guess we got to bed till about eleven thirty	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
and then having to get up and go to work the next morning	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
well you have a good day	2360	B
<silence>	2360	B
oh okay bye-bye	2360	B
	2360	B
<silence>	2313	A
well how many credit cards do you have	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
 sounds like we have no conflict we had for a while i was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one	2313	A
and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them_1 out and it and it uh	2313	A
 it it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when AT&T came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that and we've been using that one	2313	A
uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i don't know do you know any people that run up big big bills	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
well did um were you able to get one while you're in college	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
just curious because_1 i have a son that's a senior this year and he's heading off with any kind of luck but there has been i've had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student	2313	A
uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since it's it's in monitor- the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yes it's whether the parent wants to take the risk	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i i'm i'm leaning towards doing it for for convenience-	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
a convenience	2313	A
yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash	2313	A
the uh i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i don't i don't i don't carry cash around and and uh i don't even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook and-	2313	A
she writes the checks and i record them so it's uh	2313	A
it's uh it's but it's interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up with-	2313	A
on on credit cards and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer	2313	A
and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to	2313	A
and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of	2313	A
uh well it was a combination of things he had uh there were	2313	A
there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments on	2313	A
uh things like uh like the credit union's offering	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yes	2313	A
yeah	2313	A
the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
and they make more money if you extend your loan	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yes	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or anything- they're not going to keep on if the car were older	2313	A
the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks it's i think it's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt	2313	A
at least from a tax standpoint so	2313	A
it's interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so	2313	A
it's uh it's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit	2313	A
oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yeah it's on uh yeah	2313	A
yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
oh okay	2313	A
it's on it's on schedule um	2313	A
schedule a under uh	2313	A
well it's the same place it's the same place you put uh interest but but see that's what that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you can't you can't take out a a second mortgage	2313	A
uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh it's fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint	2313	A
but uh	2313	A
anyway	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
sounds like you're you're very responsible- very financially responsible it's uh	2313	A
that's uh there're a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and he's got just enormous debts and he's	2313	A
uh but i mean what do you say it's like shucks boss i'm sure sorry you've got all that debt well he's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that	2313	A
i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i don't i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
it's it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that uh apparently that's been going on for a really long time i didn't do it i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yep	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
miscellaneous things like food -and and other things these habits you get into eating and and uh it's it's it's amazing how it what you learn	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
well anything else good to say about credit cards	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
i might just	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
you don't have to carry the cash and and uh and it's it's it's certainly accepted more places than the places you know it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state and	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yeah	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
they don't allow they don't do that-	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yeah huh	2313	A
carry all that cash with you	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
well you know they they	2313	A
they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you	2313	A
yeah and i think that's where	2313	A
<silence>	2313	A
yeah i've seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the the time frame which they get paid	2313	A
in general that uh they i've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and	2313	A
you know almost well i guess it's the day after uh technically it's two days but they- they- they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the uh	2313	A
the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh	2313	A
the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so	2313	A
anyway well it's good talking to you	2313	A
maybe we'll get across we'll cross paths again good night	2313	A
	2313	A
	2313	A
	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
um	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
i've only i've got about four maybe	2313	B
i try to limit them because i well one i don't use them	2313	B
uh too much and i use my Visa just for about- for about everything and i pay it all off	2313	B
so i try not to i just use it for free money for thirty days basically	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
i'm i'm you know i'm in the age group you get out of college and i think a lot of these people have them {maxed} out	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
um i don't think i ever tried	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
um	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
well	2313	B
	2313	B
yeah i i you know it's	2313	B
you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but	2313	B
just depends	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah so basically if you want to take the risk	2313	B
 it's your risk	2313	B
do you trust your your son	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh i'd say do you know	2313	B
have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
the the extended loan payment for your car	2313	B
yeah i saw that	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
well it's it's it's business and they're making money off that	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah and and it's so it's business so and you notice that they're they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old	2313	B
and so they've already shifted the risk if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves and they'll recover the loan	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah uh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
what now what's ten percent we can deduct	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
i didn't know that	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
i didn't think you could anything on a loan or	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
i mean a mortgage i know you can	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
oh i've never itemized yet	2313	B
so maybe that's	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
schedule a or	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt and i and i use my Visa for for as much as i can and i pay it all off and	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
 and i took a five year note out on my car when i right when i got out of college and uh	2313	B
i'll never do that again i still got a couple of years on it to go and i'm	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
well you you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills uh apartment rent and	2313	B
yeah well	2313	B
yeah and and-	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah so	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
um	2313	B
yeah they're they're convenient you know that's that's a	2313	B
probably one big thing about them and	2313	B
uh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah well i was used to using my credit card like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas and stuff and now i'm out here in Phoenix	2313	B
uh	2313	B
they they none of these grocery stores take any credit cards so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know i got to have sixty bucks on me or something	2313	B
	2313	B
so uh	2313	B
that was interesting cause i always you know you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah i've heard about them	2313	B
that's mostly locally the banks will line up with uh	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
all righty	2313	B
<silence>	2313	B
all righty	2313	B
take it easy	2313	B
	2313	B
<silence>	2318	B
that's true	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
yes we do	2318	B
we we have uh the death by lethal uh by injection	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
what-	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
i'm sure that	2318	B
that that have to has happened but then there's also the um number of people who have	2318	B
created or committed murders etcetera that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row like like look at Charles Manson i mean he just happened to have the right timing	2318	B
	2318	B
and yet although he may never be free to kill again there are a lot of people like him that are free to kill again	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
but i didn't want to do it	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
huh-uh	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
i don't think that i could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone to death	2318	B
i- i- i would find that too difficult	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
um-hum	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
correct	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
something that's taught	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
um-hum	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
i don't think it's a deterrent at all i don't think that anyone that uh commits a murder actually thinks that they will ever	2318	B
even uh be punished let alone put to death for it	2318	B
i mean look at the mentality of your average person who smokes cigarettes they don't think they're ever going to get cancer and yet it's written on every single package	2318	B
most people who murder someone don't even get caught let alone prosecuted to the to the extent of the law	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
right	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
right i think for probably- possibly the premeditated murders i think it's possibly a deterrent but	2318	B
for the for the gang violence the uh the street murders so to speak i don't think it is	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
not where i live uh but i live outside of Dallas	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
the San Antonio has much more gang violence than Dallas Dallas does have um an area of town however the	2318	B
young men i mean sixteen to nineteen year old boys are shot and killed or shot at least shot	2318	B
frequently the uh the county hospital that handles all the gunshot wounds here	2318	B
handles fifteen gunshot wounds a day	2318	B
i mean a day	2318	B
	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
yeah it it obviously is not a DC you know	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
it it i understand that Vermont's relatively calm	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
um-hum	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
goodness	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
um-hum	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
yeah	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
um-hum	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
um-hum	2318	B
yeah yes they're the they're the victims of neglect and	2318	B
and uh many years of	2318	B
of perpetuated	2318	B
nonconcern for human life	2318	B
yeah it's just- it's it's just a lack of concern they don't have you know these kids	2318	B
the ones that are involved in you know gangs i think are searching for self-esteem and they find something like that in uh their gang activities	2318	B
and they never had this at home and their parents don't have it if they happen to know their parents	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
the other	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
yeah the uh the we were shocked two mornings ago with uh the news that a forty year old man had sold his three year old son	2318	B
for forty dollars worth of crack	2318	B
and they found the boy and the boy had been unharmed but they were trying to sell him you know they were trying to sell the baby or the boy and he's three years old they were trying to sell him on the black market	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
i mean it can you that that just repulsed me and it repulsed everybody that i work with i mean it you know we	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
and it was just you know twenty- twenty miles from me	2318	B
but it's it's it's it's real strange uh it's it's a world that um	2318	B
is the drugs are the drugs are going to get us all i mean drugs	2318	B
 actually i think we're doing capital punishment to the wrong people i think we ought to have capital punishment for the true importers of drugs	2318	B
not the kids that are selling it on the street that don't know any better i'm talking about the people you know who are bringing it to our country i think they deserve capital punishment because they kill	2318	B
they kill a lot	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
yeah	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
that's true	2318	B
<silence>	2318	B
<silence>	2318	A
yeah so it's got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on the list	2318	A
oh we don't have capital punishment i believe you do	2318	A
oh	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yeah the the only thing about capital punishment is the i- i remember someone saying i think it was a chief justice in this state	2318	A
he goes if you make a mistake how do you get the person back that's the whole his whole basis was if you do have that error	2318	A
you know some people have been in jail for years and years and years and they're finally exonerated and then you know if if there if you killed the person and it's like oops too bad	2318	A
i mean i think i've heard of cases where someone did they uh the they were uh it was capital punishment they were killed	2318	A
and they found out years later that the he really didn't kill the person	2318	A
i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yes	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
	2318	A
i'm the type of person who sits you know it's the same thing about the war i'm this type person you you know you need it	2318	A
but you're the one who you can't you can't make the decision and go yes or no i'd be a terrible president because	2318	A
i would you know i knew we had to go to war and i knew you know it was the best thing but i didn't i would not want to be responsible for people getting hurt if you know if i don't know	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
well uh like	2318	A
yes but like you say there there's people out there that do such terrible things well- i had one of the subjects was uh crime	2318	A
and it was talked about the the way society uh has worked out there's some people that economically trapped	2318	A
and they really their parents don't bring them up properly they have absolutely no morals because_1 no one taught them	2318	A
i mean morals isn't something that's just in your heart and	2318	A
you're born with it you're	2318	A
it's something that's taught it's something on the streets that you see so if it's a dog eat dog world	2318	A
it it's just really too bad that we have to have something like capital punishment	2318	A
but	2318	A
i- i don't know how much of a deterrent it really is	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
you don't think it's a deterrent	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
so even though even though you don't think it's a deterrent which i have a tendency to -agree agree i mean it's a deterrent it's it's the ones like carefully thinking it out and stuff	2318	A
they think about it but a lot of the street crime that goes on and stuff they don't really care and they don't really care what happens to them i can see where it's not a deterrent	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yes	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
where- where you work	2318	A
so is Dallas a bad city i talked to someone from San Antonio and and the Barrio she said it was very bad	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
Dallas	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yeah	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
oh jeez	2318	A
and that's relatively calm city	2318	A
	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yes	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
oh it's very calm i mean you can our uh bad district i wouldn't advise going walking in there alone at night but you could	2318	A
and if anyone was bothering you you could make such a fuss where people would come to your aid even though you're in the worst part of the city	2318	A
um the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we're we're a really we're uh pampered up here	2318	A
um and when they do have a crime a murder let's we had quite a few years ago a young two young men they were sixteen years old um	2318	A
raped and beat- and beat these two twelve year old girls really bad it just shocked the whole state	2318	A
just how can anything happen like this and the guys that did it were so ignorant	2318	A
they didn't even remorse- they didn't they didn't have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant	2318	A
that one of them says well i didn't realize that was- because_1 i was beating her in the head that she was really going to die on me you know it's like	2318	A
although why did you do it she was screaming all i wanted to do was shut her up he he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her i the kids were really quite ignorant about it and it	2318	A
it was a tragedy on both sides but it just shocked the uh the state that something like this could happen	2318	A
i mean usually if something if someone robs in the night or something	2318	A
and uh a home owner confronts him i mean it's not a blaze of guns and stuff you know the guy might hit the guy over the head and people start running	2318	A
i mean if this happened in the city the i'm sure the youth would be armed and just take the family out	2318	A
i mean we're really fortunate to live here but	2318	A
doing these conversations it makes me feel really bad that there are kids that	2318	A
can't can't get out of the situation they're in and they're they'll eventually end up even if they want to be good kids they'll eventually end up uh more or less victims of crimes even though they're doing the crimes they're more or less a victim	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yes it's it's really sad	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yes it's it's it's bad sometimes the kids have no choice because_1 the parents are are worse	2318	A
i mean it they'll do drugs in front of their kids they bring this boyfriends and girlfriends home in front of kids they they treat them like little slaves they holler at they hit them	2318	A
and they go they go to the gangs more or less for uh family oh this guys nice to me he doesn't hit me	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
oh jeez	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
that's stupid	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
we sit up here on our pedestals judging but we're not there but it's just it is totally unheard of that you you you even think it would happen	2318	A
oh jeez-	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yeah i know	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
oh	2318	A
<silence>	2318	A
yeah well-	2318	A
well then they wouldn't do this for the drug kingpin that they were going to um institute the death penalty other or was it life in prison or whatever for the drug kingpins i don't	2318	A
it's it's so full of bullshit	2318	A
the the drug war is just terrible- you can't trace it because a lot of the authorities are probably tied up into it i mean you know months ago it was the the military	2318	A
all right	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
um i wish i had	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
well i it was done for me after a while i had a uh i had a business going	2334	A
and this was back in the eighties i don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that	2334	A
but uh i had a coin shop	2334	A
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling	2334	A
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom	2334	A
yep	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah yeah it was i ended up going into bankruptcy- you know it was one of those things uh oh it'll get better next week you know things will pick up	2334	A
and so there i was in old bankruptcy court	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
oh yeah yeah	2334	A
oh yeah yeah i was buying from other dealers and uh	2334	A
you know they take payment any way they can get it	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because_1 i was selling it i wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it	2334	A
um	2334	A
but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and	2334	A
all that other good stuff that ate them_1 all up	2334	A
so	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
sure	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
um-hum yes	2334	A
that's the way they suck you in	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
 well just today in the mail i got uh	2334	A
i got got my	2334	A
guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express	2334	A
yeah	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah as soon as your a graduate student they get your name	2334	A
and uh	2334	A
course i guess i guess i've been purged from their records i used to have an American Express	2334	A
uh back when i had my business i got one	2334	A
and	2334	A
they they goofed up bad on my first- on my very first bill because_1 i was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses	2334	A
and the bill would come in and i'd pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay	2334	A
so i- i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didn't do anything about it Two weeks later i get another letter even nastier	2334	A
and said we're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay	2334	A
and i looked at that and i said uh-huh	2334	A
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed	2334	A
attached it to their letter and sent them_1 a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah they were i tell you they don't talk about they were charging that enormous fee every year	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
it's up to fifty five on the gold card it's eighty five for the Optima	2334	A
oh i'm sorry no fifty fifty	2334	A
yeah for the green card	2334	A
and it	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
well now and that's that's the card fee	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
oh yeah yeah it's um	2334	A
well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any but on the Optima card it's um	2334	A
let's see right now it's running at about it's not too bad it's actually it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good	2334	A
as far as credit cards go	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
 well they're dangerous	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
hum-um mine don't either	2334	A
mine don't either they have um my mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card and that's it	2334	A
 yeah yeah now i- i do use gas cards	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah yeah- yeah	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
oh yeah exactly	2334	A
uh plastic is just too easy i mean that's the that's the whole problem with it um have-	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
sure	2334	A
naturally that's i got in all kinds of trouble doing that	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
	2334	A
well	2334	A
having- having having been out of the credit game for some years now i've i've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it	2334	A
and uh	2334	A
well it is but i- i- i'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint	2334	A
uh	2334	A
yeah exactly i- i um i just went out and got a new VCR yesterday	2334	A
with cash	2334	A
and it it's	2334	A
no no i wish i did	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah i could use a discount i have to wait for the things to go on sale	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah especially on electronic goods	2334	A
especially now	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
oh Circuit City	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
 yeah they they're not their prices aren't that terrific	2334	A
they they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah they're they're all over the country now	2334	A
they uh they- they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains	2334	A
 i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise	2334	A
you- you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go	2334	A
and uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your TVs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that	2334	A
and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now	2334	A
so so much for Circuit City	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
i don't i'm a graduate student i'm a professional student	2334	A
it is	2334	A
it's it's great	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
it is great i love it	2334	A
NC State	2334	A
uh North Carolina State	2334	A
not yet	2334	A

<silence>	2334	A
where am i	2334	A
what do you mean where oh in Raleigh	2334	A
yeah good ole	2334	A
the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh	2334	A
what- what a dead place yeah	2334	A
	2334	A
i've got a nice little business at home and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
 um uh human factors	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
not a thing	2334	A
uh its	2334	A
it's it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them_1	2334	A
huh	2334	A
it's well it's more psychology and engineering uh my my master's is in industrial engineering	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
yeah	2334	A
yeah PhD in human factors	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
 well	2334	A
oh yeah	2334	A
IBM uh	2334	A
i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks but IBM is what i'm looking at right now	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
they might be but not at not at the human factors level	2334	A
there there	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
um no as a matter of fact the IBM right here or in Carey which is a little suburb of Raleigh just just hired one more human factors person	2334	A
doggone it if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me	2334	A
um i'm i'm going into thesis- or going into the uh dissertation this summer	2334	A
<silence>	2334	A
uh i'm going to start this summer i probably won't finish it until the end of the year	2334	A
but uh i'm i'm trying to get a uh	2334	A
a uh intern position with IBM right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in	2334	A
it's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field	2334	A
but	2334	A
yeah that's that and and it's it's limited application in some respects um consider- in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people most	2334	A
<silence>	2334	B
well like i told you before	2334	B
	2334	B
and you're talking about credit cards	2334	B
 we put ours up	2334	B
i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
well you should try it	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B

well i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them_1 all out because_1 you're honored right and uh	2334	B
i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right i wasn't thinking a thing about it	2334	B
yeah i was just stupid and every time they had a sale there i was because_1 you know got get such good bargains	2334	B
and i don't know	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
oh yeah we've been getting those	2334	B
i went back to school and got my Master's and they started sending those things to me again	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B

<silence>	2334	B
uh-huh	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
yeah	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B

	2334	B
	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
uh-huh	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B

of course you got to charge it and keep your cash	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
<b_aside> what what are you saying <e_aside>	2334	B
oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i- i don't really usually consider that an option	2334	B
	2334	B
maybe that's how we got in trouble	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
yeah but it's hard isn't it	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
with cash	2334	B
	2334	B
do you work with TI	2334	B
 no	2334	B

<silence>	2334	B
 sounds wonderful we were talking about that just today	2334	B
we could be just lifelong students	2334	B
where are you going to school	2334	B

get you a little name plaque	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B

<silence>	2334	B
well i heard it on the news today i could swear it was IBM	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
hum	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
how much longer do you have	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
and get that done this summer	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
ooh	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
because_1 you	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
why there been so much work done already	2334	B
<silence>	2334	B
	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
	2336	B
i currently drive a a Ford Taurus and	2336	B
i would imagine- i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard	2336	B
absolutely i have had it for about two years now and it's uh	2336	B
it's everything it's supposed to be uh i haven't had	2336	B
a minutes trouble with it and uh	2336	B
the only thing i have	2336	B
against it in that's it's a Taurus but is it i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a Honda before that	2336	B
and so it's a little bit larger but that's the only the only difference that i see really	2336	B
but i would my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally	2336	B
and	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
um-hum	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
well my wife drives a	2336	B
still has a a Honda Accord and it's a very it's an excellent automobile	2336	B
and uh but you know price and so forth i'm not a real car fan so i i	2336	B
i do not uh	2336	B
opt for uh something that would be	2336	B
you know	2336	B
expensive you know i want i want something that's serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i and with the Taurus i have a Taurus uh you know LX and it's you know	2336	B
you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines	2336	B
and as i said as far i'm concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
oh i think so too now i	2336	B
you know in travel and renting automobiles uh in i've driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so forth- and Dodge and i	2336	B
if it's Chevrolet i just will not touch it uh	2336	B
i had a Chevrolet before i bought my Taurus i purchased a	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
a Chevy um Citation	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
and uh i was ready to get rid of it two months after i bought it and uh	2336	B
so i i shopped around and i would i probably if i had thought i	2336	B
uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or or Toyota	2336	B
and uh but it was just i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop	2336	B
and he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it	2336	B
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable	2336	B
comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and AM FM radio and all these other things uh	2336	B
it was just there was no there was no comparison uh the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that	2336	B
soft American ride uh uh not well that about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it	2336	B
but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable	2336	B
and i you know i drive around a lot but uh and it's you know it's very comfortable on the highway i can drive for you know ten hours or so and	2336	B
not really be tired in any way	2336	B
but those are my criteria and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if there's something out there that uh	2336	B
is comparable to what i have now	2336	B
so i'll go ahead and get it	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
um-hum	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
 i see yeah	2336	B
in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new Honda sports cars	2336	B
uh i i can't remember what the name is it's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is	2336	B
and it looked it resembled a Mazaratti very very closely	2336	B
and	2336	B
it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth but	2336	B
to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just	2336	B
	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
um-hum	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
that's true well	2336	B
uh the difference there is too is uh is between us is that	2336	B
i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen	2336	B
so i've never really cared now what i was you know before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little	2336	B
you know sports car racing i never	2336	B
it was never my own car it was always someone else's	2336	B
and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive	2336	B
uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard so	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
well i guess we've discussed that enough don't you think we won't we don't we won't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight that's happened to me almost every time i've	2336	B
well when- it's it's very easy when you get a topic- you get on a topic that you know you enjoy and	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
oh yeah yeah	2336	B
<silence>	2336	B
	2336	B
well i was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and uh we were cut off uh-huh well we were told to quit okay well you have a pleasant evening	2336	B
take care good-bye	2336	B
	2336	B
<silence>	2336	A
okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
well when you decide to	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
so you like the Ford	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
right	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh Yeah it's the this the car i had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh i loved it i really did	2336	A
But uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So i bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X	2336	A
But even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
right	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
well Ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to ten- six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
um	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
oh yeah those were not good cars	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
right	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
right	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh You know the only thing i'm looking at right now um i just i just bought you know the Nissan that i've got about uh say nine months ago i guess it was	2336	A
 So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment i'm single	2336	A
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh i don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know	2336	A
uh cars are too expensive right now to uh	2336	A
to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it's	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
um	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
yeah that's uh i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago	2336	A
and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But	2336	A
then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didn't even let you near the car i mean they were that's how expensive they were	2336	A
um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and	2336	A
you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i can't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know i	2336	A
that doesn't seem likely	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
i think so	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
that's happened to me once so uh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on Saudi- the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more so	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
yeah	2336	A
<silence>	2336	A
you too uh-huh bye-bye	2336	A
	2336	A
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
well	2320	B
we take the rent first	2320	B
you know we need to have a roof over our head	2320	B
and then we take the car	2320	B
you know we need a car to get back and forth to work	2320	B
and then it's the utilities	2320	B
and then the food	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
uh	2320	B
and then uh the regular bills	2320	B
you know your credit cards and your uh	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
uh	2320	B
i i'm trying to think what else phone the phone- utilities come last or uh before let's see the utilities come before the food and the bills	2320	B
the uh credit card you know the credit cards and what else is there that we pay you know we got loans	2320	B
things like that they come before the uh uh they come after everything else	2320	B
they're last on it because you know uh they	2320	B
they're never late but they're the least uh bothersome- bothersome to us you know uh we need a roof and all that before we need anything else	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah well i'm a homemaker myself so he he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the way it	2320	B
should be and	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
or the way whatever way we can	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
i can imagine i uh you know i haven't gone through a divorce myself i've only been married once but uh	2320	B
i know a lot of people that have and a lot of them's got alimony and child support and all that	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah i bet	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
well that's better than having them living with you	2320	B
 they're more expensive right there day in and day out	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah i bet you do	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah oh well me and my husband-	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
 i love it when my husband decides to to say fudge with the budget and uh sneak a big gift in	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
i've got one of them	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
 well uh my mother-in-law gave us one for Christmas a couple years ago i don't think it's five inches i think it's a little bit bigger than that	2320	B
but it runs on uh car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity	2320	B
so it's a neat little thing to have	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
uh well they have- we have direct deposit that helps a lot	2320	B
uh and uh	2320	B
first thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard from now for three months ahead	2320	B
and uh you know he makes the same amount every week	2320	B
uh he's not it's not salary he gets paid by the hour but we know exactly to the penny how much he's going to get unless he works over and then it's	2320	B
uh you know that's extra uh but	2320	B
he's got us situated to where we pay uh pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and then all the little ones at the middle of the month	2320	B
and uh none of them's ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and uh	2320	B
it works out real well uh	2320	B
most problem we had was when uh	2320	B
let's see when was it	2320	B
something like we had a three pay- uh weekends	2320	B
uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period	2320	B
and uh we was close to being uh	2320	B
oh shoot i'm trying to think it's been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh	2320	B
it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away	2320	B
uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff	2320	B
and so that was pretty bad but	2320	B
i don't know i like that he's got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah pretty much uh	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
with the direct deposit that's what helps you know because he doesn't have the money in hand	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
oh well he's he's we got that ATM machine and that and his bank is right there at his work	2320	B
and that's hard you know uh i'm sure you're familiar with TI up here	2320	B
and you know how they got the Texans- uh that Texans Credit Union	2320	B
right there he uh	2320	B
he's good at uh getting into that but he's good- he's you know we never in my i- i've been married to him for seven years and we've never had a check bounce	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
and uh well no i take that back one time we did uh	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
it didn't bounce but it came close we called our landlord and asked her to hold off on check cashing the check for three days we was overdrawn six dollars	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
so	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
 but uh it was i don't know we've never he we've had problems meeting our bills before but uh we've met them	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah that's what's going to hurt us in April uh we owe on our taxes and that will hurt	2320	B
and yeah that's taking money that we didn't have you know that we had set aside for uh a bill or two and we're trying to finagle now getting ready for it because we got to pay them by April	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
well i know how it is to start out with nothing uh you know	2320	B
and uh i'm we're up to where	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
close to where we want to be but we're not quite there yet	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah i just can- i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job	2320	B
but then	2320	B
i'd rather be with my kids	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah well you know i've got a two year old and a four year old and uh	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah but i know it would help with the bills	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
yeah	2320	B
<silence>	2320	B
okay well it was nice talking to you	2320	B
all right bye-bye	2320	B
	2320	B
	2320	A
well Bonny	2320	A
how do you do your budget	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
yeah	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
utilities and stuff like that	2320	A
yeah	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
yeah i kind of think you ought to make make them wait until the last possible minute for it	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
we do ours uh fairly similar course uh we both have married before	2320	A
and uh so what what we do is kind of divide up the bills based on who makes the most money	2320	A
and whoever makes the most money course takes the most you know the biggest part of the bills	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
i wish we could do that unfortunately	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
between two divorces it kind of it kind of taps you out pretty good	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
oh yeah it that takes a big hunk out of your budget it costs me about uh three thousand dollars a year for child support	2320	A
which is after i mean that's net that's that's right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
yeah	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
that's what i hear although although i kind of miss some of that stuff	2320	A
yeah but you know you know bills wise uh we kind of divide everything up and i take i take the bigger portion of it and uh my wife takes some of hers	2320	A
and we have an agreement that uh if we're going to charge anything over like seventy five or eighty dollars then we uh we talk about it	2320	A
unless of course it's uh it's like for a present or whatever	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
and we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
yeah i uh i was trying to finagle our budget around because uh my wife wanted	2320	A
she really wanted a little small five inch TV she could carry around the house or you know back in her sewing room whenever she's watching television	2320	A
and she wanted one so bad and we were just kind of short on money	2320	A
and so all through the year i i was putting you know five or ten dollars back fifteen twenty whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there	2320	A
i was hanging onto it i thought God you know come Christmas time we're going to have that television set come hell or high water	2320	A
and sure enough we got it	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
yeah	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
how how do you divide- uh you just divide up your uh the money just you just make a deposit in the bank and kind of go from there huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
	2320	A
he's got a stable schedule then	2320	A
everything kind of works out well	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
yeah if if if you don't have to go down to the bank for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well i'll take five or ten dollars here	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
oh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
oh yeah	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh Tex Tower yeah	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
that's good	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
that's not too bad	2320	A
that that's cutting it pretty close though	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
well i think everybody has problems meeting bills now	2320	A
not too much you can do about it	2320	A
between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
oh yeah so do we	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
uh-huh	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
yeah they want their money real quick	2320	A
that's the only bad part we got the same problem	2320	A
however i guess it uh beats the alternative	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
just not having anything to start out with	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
oh yeah	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
well you get if you just keep trying pretty soon you make it	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
well you know kids are important you got stay- you have to stay home with the kids	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
well soon as they get in to school it won't it won't be so bad	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
well Bonny	2320	A
it- it sounds like a pretty good idea	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
tell you what uh i think we about done our about five minutes	2320	A
<silence>	2320	A
okay we'll check you later	2320	A
bye-bye	2320	A
	2320	A
<silence>	2353	B
well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially Germany and Finland um	2353	B
they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible i know um	2353	B
the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i believe- i really believe that the people that do that	2353	B
are better people and uh make our society better	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
hm	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
yeah	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
hm	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
yes yes but if	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um	2353	B
there's kind of a selfishness i mean teenagers in our country are kind of	2353	B
kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um	2353	B
thinking less of your own needs but of other people	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
oh no	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
right	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
yes	2353	B
it would really um and i don't the people that i've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend but still	2353	B
they have benefited from it and um you know although i wouldn't want	2353	B
military- military- to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature than the average student and	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
well that's right a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just	2353	B
are so excited to be away from home that they just spend all their time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we don't really want our young people to be doing and	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
yeah	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
because- because we're so	2353	B
we love our freedom and our freedom of choice	2353	B
and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and	2353	B
of course we think it's helping other people and so	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
and they're preoccupied with drinking	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
uh-huh and	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
that's true	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
that's really true	2353	B
yes well i- i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
oh really	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
hm	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with	2353	B
what my what i was going to study and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer why because they make a lot of money	2353	B
and they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
area yes	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
yes there's too many people	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
that's right and not enough people want to do that to for	2353	B
uh because of a service that they could provide you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because_1 you think that's the best way to be rich	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
that's kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go	2353	B
<silence>	2353	B
well good luck to you i enjoyed it	2353	B
thanks bye-bye	2353	B
	2353	B
<silence>	2353	A
so what do you think about a year or two of public service	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
uh-huh	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yes yeah	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
uh-huh	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
you know i- i really agree with you um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach	2353	A
to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from a nice	2353	A
middle class white suburban home and i did it um	2353	A
for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed	2353	A
it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me	2353	A
and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i- i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about	2353	A
doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back	2353	A
um because- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans	2353	A
i- i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because_1 i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old	2353	A
um i've had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed	2353	A
uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church	2353	A
that does that um-hum because_1 one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would've probably like you said	2353	A
to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think would've been a very good um experience for me	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yes	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yeah	2353	A
and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i- i think i was paid	2353	A
uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids	2353	A
um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors	2353	A
and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty	2353	A
and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities	2353	A
for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um	2353	A
things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i- i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yeah	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yeah	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
right um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yeah i think it would also help them_1 if they then went on to college i know that my first couple of years of college were um	2353	A
uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
yeah that's true	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum that's right	2353	A
i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic	2353	A
uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough	2353	A
uh you know	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
yep that's true	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
oh i think it is	2353	A
i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students	2353	A
and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um their self-centeredness	2353	A
and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
yep i think that's uh just- just having a good time	2353	A
i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as uh short-term pleasure oriented i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it	2353	A
you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun	2353	A
um-hum yeah	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the uh funding for the Peace Corps	2353	A
uh-huh because i guess because_1 of the changes in Eastern Europe	2353	A
uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yes yeah that's true	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yeah that's very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i- i live near Washington being in in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington	2353	A
area are lawyers	2353	A
and and i- i just sort of think that's ridiculous yeah with	2353	A
you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know	2353	A
	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
right um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run yeah that's true	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
that's interesting um-hum	2353	A
<silence>	2353	A
okay hey thanks so much for the conversation	2353	A
well thank you very much bye-bye	2353	A
	2353	A

<silence>	2392	B
yeah	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
well how old are your kids	2392	B
oh so they really like that sort of stuff then	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
i can remember many times that when when- it's interesting though that that you know particularly when you're traveling and you go some place you can stop at a McDonald's that's that's a big playground	2392	B
uh when the- kids- you know when the kids really need to get out and run around after been driving a while	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
yeah that that that's really nice that they started doing that because_1 it's the problem is you take them to some place nice and	2392	B
and you know the um even a place where they have to to sit down even if they really get kids they get they get bored in a hurry	2392	B
and uh yeah you know we now that we're a little older we can go to i- i still like um i like buffets	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
yeah well have you been in the area very long	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
oh	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
you say you in Denison oh okay so we were i was in Sherman um	2392	B
hum	2392	B
last month of the i took a i sponsored a youth group up there and uh it was funny we went to a uh oh we must have had thirty of us and we went into a Pizza Hut	2392	B
and you wander into a Pizza Hut with that kind of crowd and they sort of hate to see you coming so they're they get the business but	2392	B
with a crowd of people it's uh it it it was kind of funny and we went in first and then it was so crowded and we went and i'm trying to think it's right off anyway i don't know if it's Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn anyway we went to another one and- and uh	2392	B
they the rates there are fairly reasonable but uh you know even those places are starting to have you know video games and things for kids to your kids play video games	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
oh well that gives him something to amuse him while there uh	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
yeah	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
 well do you have do you have any like Chucky Cheese or trying to	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
well they got one um in Richardson probably me i try and think there there there's a couple of those that they combined and it's a combination pizza parlor and all kinds of	2392	B
and yeah and and- they have the the room full of balls and	2392	B
yeah yeah Show Biz that's the name of it	2392	B
well do you like the pizza at Show Biz	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
oh	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
yeah yeah	2392	B
well you know they're so large they animated it	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
yeah that's really uh	2392	B
yeah we were until the kids got older we'd go there and you know it was um	2392	B
that right i'll date myself a little bit but it it's remarkable the number of those things they need	2392	B
i guess i think Show Biz and and Chucky Cheese and all those i think they merged or something but it still it's still quite popular i have to i'm not sure the pizza was okay i mean	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
um-hum	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
um-hum	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B

<silence>	2392	B
well we got a lot of barbecue places around around the Dallas area uh Spring Creek Barbecue that's right in Richardson and it uh i- i like the barbecue there	2392	B
um and it it's fairly reasonable you can get um it i mean if if you know you go through the line and and pick up your food	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B
yeah it is	2392	B
<silence>	2392	B

<silence>	2392	A
<silence>	2384	A
that's right	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
get sick with the flu	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
uh-oh	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
wow are these disc brakes	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
right	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
well i have a Nissan uh Maxima and i had the rear brakes on those	2384	A
redone but i guess auto repairs are cheaper around here i think it was around eighty five dollars	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
is expensive uh-huh	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
uh-huh	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
uh-huh	2384	A
you're very fortunate	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
well i ran into a problem with my car uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after we'd had a freezing rain apparently	2384	A
and there's some kind of a boot that had- had come off the car so the emergency brake froze on	2384	A
and my	2384	A
uh brakes were on all the time i drove to work one morning	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but	2384	A
that that was the reason i had to replace mine	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
right	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
 you would hope so but	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
that you can't turn	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
that's right	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
	2384	A
i've seen your spaghetti bridges though when i wouldn't want to go over them	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
you do that yourself	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
oh you're	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
that's right	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
i've thought about taking a course just so i could change my own oil but and that would help a little bit but i haven't done it	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
oh no	2384	A
oh	2384	A
that's crazy	2384	A
that is mean	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
 or take it to the pit and let them let somebody else do it	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
they have but i really hate paying twenty two ninety five for an oil change	2384	A
when i know what the oil costs	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
right uh-huh	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
right	2384	A
uh	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
well	2384	A
right some of the stations around here will take it	2384	A
i think maybe they have to accept it	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
recycle it	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
that's right um we were down in Dallas right after Christmas and on the way back we stopped in Louisiana to visit my brother	2384	A
and we were driving my husband's Toyota pick up truck well we made a quick little stop when we got to Baton Rouge and he came- came back out	2384	A
and the car the truck wouldn't stop i mean it wouldn't start	2384	A
so gave it a somebody came along and helped give it a little push and the next morning they took it to the garage and	2384	A
 it was just a small private garage and he said it was the starter motor probably and he was going to take it off and	2384	A
either repair it or replace it or whatever and we got a call in the middle of the morning and he said i've got good news and bad news	2384	A
uh the starter motor is fine it would- it just had a	2384	A
couple of bolts that held it in place	2384	A
and one had been broken off	2384	A
and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldn't	2384	A
match just right and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a	2384	A
garage and pick them_1 up pick the bolts up for him	2384	A
so he went to a used car garage i guess or place and got the bolts and	2384	A
had it running for about fifteen dollars i couldn't believe it because the man could have really stuck us	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
no it was great	2384	A
<silence>	2384	A
okay Greg	2384	A
okay thank you bye	2384	A
	2384	A
yeah auto repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of people don't uh don't like i guess because_1 it's usually expensive and uh people end up	2384	B
not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess it's kind of a sour grapes type topic i just recently had um	2384	B
put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have and fortunately i- i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i	2384	B
got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of {fluish} type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and	2384	B
need the car the next day type deal so	2384	B
yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and	2384	B
and uh start over so uh with little things like that it's it's still a lot cheaper uh that particular job for that particular model car runs a hundred and fifty dollars	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while you're in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn it down and and	2384	B
put the uh grease the bearings up since it's been a while since they'd been done and	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn't be too expensive but it's when while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those	2384	B
that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know that's twenty five dollars and the rotors another twenty five dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and	2384	B
i just go buy the things for for uh about thirty bucks and put them_1 on myself	2384	B
but uh it's a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a weekend you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
oh boy bet that got warm	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah that'll do it it'll cook the whole whole insides there	2384	B
hum i don't know what the	2384	B
what the solution for that would have been you would have thought they'd have put all those parts that were pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot they'd unfreeze	2384	B
that would be nice if uh all that was	2384	B
huh that's interesting	2384	B
yeah i'm glad we don't have that problem too often down here i've heard a lot of horror stories about people that	2384	B
go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you can't turn and you can't stop in a hurry and no i'll stay down here in the South that's	2384	B
it's a little bit different	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah that's true	2384	B
that's true	2384	B
well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so	2384	B
we do that kind of maintenance and	2384	B
yeah do the oil change- oil and filter and air filters and	2384	B
spark plugs and the like can't do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car now that computers taken over that control	2384	B
um it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that reads that and	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
well i'll tell you some of the horror stories that the the male populace have done to the women i- i recall a a uh	2384	B
coed when i was in college some of the guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to	2384	B
uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in all four or five quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick	2384	B
and she did it oh and it was just	2384	B
that was mean	2384	B
yep	2384	B
so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have friends like that or take a little course in	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
yeah those have really cropped up uh years of late but uh	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah yeah that's	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
that's true i usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so and	2384	B
and uh stack up on a case of that and grab the two dollars filters when they're on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the oil is getting harder these days	2384	B
end up having to take it somewhere	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
right	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless it's a hassle or a labor	2384	B
in you know just dealing with the customer maybe that's there only reason why they don't it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on we'll take your money	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
right	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
um-hum wouldn't catch right	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
hum	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
well that's not	2384	B
yeah that's true	2384	B
that's not to bad then	2384	B
<silence>	2384	B
well i hear my kids are needing me again so i'll	2384	B
go see what they need and we'll maybe talk to you again	2384	B
um bye	2384	B
	2384	B
<silence>	2382	B
well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as as what was the topic	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
oh God No why don't you go first	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
hm well let me ask a personal question how old are you	2382	B
oh well then you you get the over thirty five everything goes downhill flop	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
oh well you're lucky then because_1 i've battled arthritis all my life i mean even since i was like about two or three that's when they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and uh i do water aerobics	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
religiously do water aerobics	2382	B
i used to do about six times a week and now i'm down to about four	2382	B
but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in shape- in in there uh i tried weight training and i'm telling you you just i just can't lift the things	2382	B
and the shock on the system is is just too much so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and	2382	B
trying to keep in shape that way but you know it's hard to find i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are	2382	B
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way	2382	B
to get in shape without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd	2382	B
so i've considered even becoming licensed to teach it	2382	B
	2382	B
	2382	B
yeah but you have to have an indoor pool	2382	B
so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water and that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training	2382	B
and that does look very odd in the water	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
no and you know that's about the only place i haven't tried and people have told me now that's the Texan facility	2382	B
i have been told that thing is just lovely	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
huh have- now do you use that facility a lot	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
hum do you know if they have child care there	2382	B
	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
	2382	B
they don't i don't i don't work at TI	2382	B
no i used to work at TI as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and i used to fill out those attitude surveys and uh	2382	B
uh me and the uh insurance adjusters- adjusters are are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there and uh	2382	B
i get my attitude expressed through them but i find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short sided mentality to save a few bucks uh and	2382	B
never having lived in Texas before i started to work for TI and i came down here and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers and	2382	B
boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that you know and it's not applicable to me and i was kind of horrified	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
we're talking nineteen seventy eight	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
 they couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
i understand i understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care and uh the reason i'm at home is when i had my kids and i was uh scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um	2382	B
i had been rated number one in the field and then i took uh when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early	2382	B
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment sure	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
and then they used to uh and then i had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them_1 back to back and of course to maintain	2382	B
and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because_1 that's when i go into labor that's like four and a half months and i don't even know it	2382	B
oh yeah very easy ah very easy and they they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to to you know to	2382	B
to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor i think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar	2382	B
bill but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work and that was when they had God it would have been the eighty five layoff	2382	B
and i'll tell you how they handled this and i was just outraged i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated	2382	B
until i filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and i went back and i said what	2382	B
the hell is going on here you know and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway and uh	2382	B
you know we've got people here that really you know need to be working and so that we had just you know it was this way we didn't have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go	2382	B
and it took me about a year of arguing i said you know you've got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i couldn't get my insurance benefits and i couldn't get my uh termination benefits either	2382	B
i was just pissed as hell that they could do that	2382	B
but i- i guess things have gotten better i've been told that there's flex hour and those kind of things	2382	B
i still don't think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again	2382	B
but let me ask you this since you use Texans how much is it a month	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
now is that for an individual	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
that's it	2382	B
now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you're taking	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
God that's cheap	2382	B
that's really cheap	2382	B
do you have to be an active TI employee to join Texans or	2382	B
or the dependent on God i am so dependent these days it's offensive to me {alrighty} well i i'm seeing that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence	2382	B
yeah so my uh position from management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy i think i'm going to go contact Texans	2382	B
i really think i am i mean that beats any offer i've heard in a long time	2382	B
huh {alrighty} when you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
see i'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
oh i i'm actually right on the Plano line	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
yeah	2382	B
<silence>	2382	B
oh God it sounds like i would i might do that then okay i learned something here	2382	B
you can go back to work now	2382	B
thank you	2382	B
bye-bye	2382	B
	2382	B
okay do you want to go first	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
fitness and exercise	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
okay um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling	2382	A
and just walking uh and swimming i- i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall	2382	A
and the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
thirty eight	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
really	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
ooh	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
oh i bet that helps	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
um-hum	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
that's right that's right	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
that's right	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
this is true	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
well now at	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
i can believe that have you tried the uh the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yes	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
it is they keep it at eighty one degrees year-round	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
um a fair a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
 um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet	2382	A
you need to put that on there seriously	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
oh you don't	2382	A
oh	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
this is true	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
well it's not a	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
now what year are we talking about	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
okay uh things have become much more enlightened since then	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah you know we still don't have day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yes yes	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
ooh	2382	A
my gosh	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
could you hold the phone for one second thanks	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
	2382	A
okay i'm back	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
wow	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
really	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah really	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
there you go	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
i- i can believe that	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
oh yeah flex time is great	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
i- i can understand i can understand well it's been good talking with you	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
oh shoot it's only about ten bucks a month	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something it's no big deal	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah it is	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
well or or a dependent- or a dependent of one	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
really	2382	A
	2382	A
wonderful	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
oh yeah it's great	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
uh well it would depend on when you go it's not it's not excessively crowded on the weekends	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
oh i don't think that would be bad at all if you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the to the Dallas site	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
oh well then you could go either- either one the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more	2382	A
niceties amenities and you'd probably like the pool there	2382	A
<silence>	2382	A
well i'm good i'm glad well thank you you have a good day bye-bye	2382	A
okay	2349	B
um	2349	B
i i understand that it's being proposed as a requirement for uh young people to be	2349	B
to go into public service i think	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah yeah i think that it probably would be a a good program i think probably two years is too long i think maybe a year would be the the longest that-	2349	B
yeah and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don't think that they're gonna be serving anybody	2349	B
yeah so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing	2349	B
to get out there and do so	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
right right college credit is a good idea because	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
right	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
that's right yeah they probably couldn't do anything monetary but i think giving- giving some kind of college credit	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
uh-huh	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
no i don't think so either because_1 a lot of people um depending on how the public service programs are set up and i'm not -that that familiar with them to know	2349	B
but you know if a lot of people flat can't afford to you know that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into um financial situations where they have to be working all the time	2349	B
so it's it's a really tough question	2349	B
that's right	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that's that postpones their college for a year and that would upset a lot of people too because_1 they just wanna get on	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah i you know i think it it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program but i i- i think it can't be something that's mandatory it has to be something that's voluntary you know which is a pretty much the way it is now they might	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah and -that's the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe- maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and	2349	B
do programs and tell them_1 that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah in their own community right	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah that's true most of them_1 probably wouldn't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents	2349	B
 but they would have to be supportive in some way and i'm not sure those those programs are available to do that	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
right	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
right exactly that's	2349	B
yeah it is tough it's and- and i don't know who's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
yeah	2349	B
yeah i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them_1 you know it'd be it it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that	2349	B
you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience you get them_1 all in the auditorium and you you know give them_1 your speech and maybe a little slide show or something and	2349	B
and i think that they could get some results from that because_1 there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they don't know where to go to to to do anything	2349	B
yeah it is it really is	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
right yeah	2349	B
yeah	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
uh-huh	2349	B
<silence>	2349	B
i don't either	2349	B
that's what	2349	B
yeah it is a tough question	2349	B
	2349	B
sure same here take- you too bye-bye	2349	B
<silence>	2349	A
all right	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
uh-huh	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yes all all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yep	2349	A
yeah probably- you're probably right yeah two years is might be a little too long	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
that's right that	2349	A
that would be the problem	2349	A
sure would	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it	2349	A
uh you know college credit you know something you know i'm not sure what but i-	2349	A
i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind that that kind of takes away from public service	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday you know i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
i'm not either really	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
that's right that's right	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
uh-huh	2349	A
that's right absolutely then you'll you'll	2349	A
young families whatever they just- they just couldn't you know take off to do that	2349	A
only	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
that's right um-hum	2349	A
um-hum sure would there would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yep	2349	A
yep	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
that's right i'm not even really sure this point in time you know what what programs are out there	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
like maybe if if there was something you know they could do in their own own you know their own town or city	2349	A
yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know and- go somewhere half way around the world or something	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
that's right	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah that's that's true too that's true too but-	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
yeah me either and you you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know	2349	A
just sit around for their year or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind	2349	A
yep it's tough it's tough	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
i'm i'm not sure either	2349	A
but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum yeah	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yep that's right	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
yeah	2349	A
<silence>	2349	A
um-hum	2349	A
that's right	2349	A
yeah that's a real waste too it really is	2349	A
i don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the Carter administration that was that was a big thing with him	2349	A
and i guess even back to Kennedy as a matter of fact- i guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was it you know really interested in things like that	2349	A
but- i just don't hear much about it anymore like i say i don't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know	2349	A
anyway it's a tough question really is you know	2349	A
okay well thanks for your time enjoyed talking to you okay take care bye bye	2349	A
	2349	A
	2399	A
okay um let's see how do you feel about credit cards	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
right	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
right	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
right	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
wow	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
wow	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
well we uh me and my wife when	2399	A
when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
yeah we'll we'll use it but like last year i think we paid um i think it was like twenty something cents interest	2399	A
on our Visa	2399	A
and i think this this year we	2399	A
uh i think we used it for Christmas and we got caught just a few days on our grace period	2399	A
and uh so we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars but we don't like to do that at all	2399	A
and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly	2399	A
we uh we have several credit cards though	2399	A
um we have a gas card our Visa and then of course the American Express	2399	A
and i think we have a couple of department stores	2399	A
but we use it the same way and uh	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
right right	2399	A
it's it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill that's usually how we do it	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A

yeah	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
right	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
right	2399	A
well that's good i've	2399	A
i don't think we've gone that far we've been before to pay it in advance- you know in advance before we spend it but	2399	A
i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A

oh okay	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
oh okay	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
yeah you have a very um	2399	A
very what's the word your your speech is very exact	2399	A
	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
oh really	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
wow	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
right i i work in uh a wafer fab	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
they	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
yeah i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject so i think you get ten so	2399	A
i think we're okay	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
well- well you too	2399	A
same here	2399	A
bye	2399	A
<silence>	2399	A
	2399	A
<silence>	2399	B
	2399	B
personally i do not care for them	2399	B
uh although i find them a necessity in business and so forth i i try to refrain from their use as much as possible	2399	B
um	2399	B
for a number of reasons	2399	B
one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them	2399	B
the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know American Express	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
and uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
i'm not	2399	B
i'm not terribly in favor of them not for my own personal uh point of view	2399	B
plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
debt	2399	B
um	2399	B
tremendously	2399	B
to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe is number uh at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard	2399	B
do you use them frequently or	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
	2399	B
uh-huh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
yes	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
uh-huh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
i find the one i use mostly uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
aside from the American Express i do use	2399	B
my Sears card	2399	B
uh	2399	B
but	2399	B
uh	2399	B
i try as with the American Express i try to pay it	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
you know as it comes in	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
so uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
i know when i travel or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my American Express card	2399	B
is	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
before i would before i left	2399	B
i would mail a check to to American Express	2399	B
and	2399	B
you know have some idea of how much was there you know i'd sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever	2399	B
i felt i would spend	2399	B
and then use it then	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
but uh you know for hotels and and so forth but uh	2399	B
but i knew that it was paid i knew	2399	B
i knew that i had that much credit going in sometimes you know sometimes i would go over but uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
it wouldn't you know it wouldn't hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
uh-huh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
well i found you know i found in um	2399	B
in traveling overseas	2399	B
that uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
often	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
for uh for hotel bills and so forth	2399	B
plus i would uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
when they	2399	B
uh	2399	B
would send the bill and they would automatically convert	2399	B
to the	2399	B
exchange rate	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
so	2399	B
now the only time- time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
uh for example i remember on one trip to France	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
when i started planning the trip	2399	B
i think uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
a dollar was worth nine or ten francs	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
and just in a matter of a week or two	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
the dollar fell against the franc drastically and when- when i finally got over there	2399	B
it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar so the	2399	B
 so	2399	B
i got caught a little short in that regard but uh	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh	2399	B
let's say if it were	2399	B
say sixty or seventy francs a night	2399	B
that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so	2399	B
or maybe twenty dollars- maybe it would be more than that it was more than	2399	B
it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate	2399	B
but then	2399	B
when i got back and i was working for the government at the time	2399	B
uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate	2399	B
so there's a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate	2399	B
	2399	B
that that was the only time i really got caught short and i	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard	2399	B
and it yeah yeah	2399	B
well from where are you calling	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
so you're from Dallas- okay i'm from Maryland	2399	B
yeah	2399	B
no i work for GTE	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
yes	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
well i know Jack Godfrey	2399	B
i know him very well i've known Jack for a long time and i'm also in the speech business	2399	B
so when i heard that Jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an application where i could participate	2399	B
in this and uh	2399	B
so that's how i got involved	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
oh thank you very much but uh	2399	B
as Jack said i'm one of the uh	2399	B
the old hands in the speech business i- i've i've uh yes i i've been doing it for twenty some odd years	2399	B
and so uh uh i was very much interested in uh getting involved in uh switchboard	2399	B
so	2399	B
uh you work for TI	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
oh really oh	2399	B
i guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
okay	2399	B
<silence>	2399	B
right	2399	B
well all right	2399	B
okay fine well you have a good evening	2399	B

pretty windy	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B

<silence>	2371	B
oh yeah	2371	B
oh really	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
uh-huh	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
right well you know they said that we haven't had enough rain though and that surprises me because_1 it seems like we've had a lot of rain this year	2371	B
but since we've uh last i heard that we hadn't met our you know hadn't got up to the right level yet that we	2371	B
right well it truly surprises me because_1 it seems like we	2371	B
seems like we do get a lot of rain but i guess not i guess it doesn't accumulate too much	2371	B
but um i'm glad it's summer	2371	B
	2371	B
me too	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
i don't either i want some you know ski or something you know i'm benefiting from it	2371	B
i guess in a way i just i really like the summer like to uh be able to lay out or you know just be outside	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
i know it seems like you can never get warm enough to	2371	B
i do too	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah yeah	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
true	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
that's true that's true it does seem to uh	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
uh-huh	2371	B
uh-huh i do like um	2371	B
like an old uh warm summer the breezes that it gets at night you know you can open your windows and	2371	B
oh and it gets those nice warm breezes coming in that's nice	2371	B
 and that helps on utilities	2371	B
yeah and that's especially in Garland it's real bad	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah yeah well we didn't have much we had some good ice but not a lot thank goodness not	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B

<silence>	2371	B
well that's true well a friend of mine went home this weekend uh he lives up in the uh Pan Handle	2371	B
and um he went home for Easter and it snowed up there and then the next day it was up to seventy five	2371	B
yeah that would be horrible	2371	B
i wouldn't like that	2371	B
well you just can't depend on it	2371	B
yeah yeah it's just real comfortable here where we live and that's the way i like it i like being able to depend on a hot summer and	2371	B
you know it does- it gets cold enough in the winter to where you	2371	B
yeah and you can do your fires and everything and then move on	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah	2371	B
right	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
i don't either	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah yeah i wouldn't mind some you know like i guess after awhile in the summer when it hits i guess about October and you get a few cool days	2371	B
i don't mind that because_1 it kind of gives you some relief	2371	B
you know that's nice	2371	B
yeah	2371	B
yeah they really are	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass	2371	B

<silence>	2371	B
yeah yeah it really is it's just an old gray looking sky and it's boring	2371	B
really i guess it wouldn't be bad if you i guess up north it wouldn't be bad to visit we we love to go skiing and um snow it's beautiful when it snows and you have all those pine trees and everything that is pretty but i sure couldn't live there	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B

um	2371	B
um-hum	2371	B
	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B

yeah	2371	B
hum	2371	B
right	2371	B
right	2371	B
i don't blame you i would too	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
	2371	B
i do hate that feeling though it	2371	B
yeah yeah my fingers always get get it real bad i hate that i mean i bundle them_1 up and everything and and i still get it	2371	B
i guess i can bare the cold it's just when it does the wind hits	2371	B
oh that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone	2371	B
	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
yeah it hurts	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
exactly hurts i hate it	2371	B
<silence>	2371	B
well me either	2371	B
it's kind of a boring topic	2371	B
i guess	2371	B
all right then i'm through you too bye-bye	2371	B
	2371	B
	2371	A
okay we're supposed to	2371	A
talk about what the weather's been like let's see uh	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah it's been windy the past few weeks i've noticed that	2371	A
has been hasn't been too much rain which is really nice	2371	A
because_1 last week all that rain and it was just	2371	A
bad with all the flooding when uh Trinity Mills Road flooded over all those times and you couldn't i couldn't pass by it	2371	A
well i- i didn't have to go down there but uh	2371	A
uh driving on the freeway was uh made it difficult because_1 everybody couldn't get off and they'd get off somewhere else	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah the current average or whatever	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah finally	2371	A
i like the warm weather	2371	A
and the winter wasn't that bad i was really grateful that it didn't get that bad this winter	2371	A
i'm not uh fan of cold weather i've lived up in in the northern part of the country and i never did like the cold weather that much	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah i don't mind the heat that much it doesn't bother me that much cold weather i just i don't know i just can't tolerate too much with the uh	2371	A
yeah so i like Texas it's a nice place to be	2371	A
and so i guess it's probably the same over where you're at in Garland as opposed to Lewisville	2371	A
i would think i don't know might be a little bit different because_1 the city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because_1 of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
that's why they say always say it's like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
	2371	A
who can't use that	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
especially_1 in Texas period	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
well have you lived in Texas all your life	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
no uh this is this is the fifth state i've lived in	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
so i've just been all over the country and uh some places had really cold weather when i was living in Indiana it got really cold	2371	A
i mean one day it was like sixty below zero	2371	A
and uh uh they said you know stay inside	2371	A
in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonight's going to be like eighty below	2371	A
and he said uh this is serious folks this is serious business stay inside do not go outside at any for any reason	2371	A
and i thought yeah no kidding	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
that of course that was last year when we had the real bad freeze you know in the country and this last winter wasn't wasn't that bad as as i remember it	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
uh-huh	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
is that right	2371	A
	2371	A
schizophrenic weather	2371	A
	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
you realize it	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
when i lived in California they had uh	2371	A
what i describe as boring weather it was the same virtually year-round which what i thought was great you didn't have to worry about tornadoes you didn't have to worry about uh too cold or too hot it was just nice and even and i liked that it was it was nice	2371	A
but uh i don't mind the heat	2371	A
i don't i don't miss the cold at all but i don't mind the heat	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah that's right it's kind of nice too to have that fall	2371	A
spring and fall are nice times of the year	2371	A
spring because_1 we're getting that getting rid of winter finally	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah yeah	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah no kidding	2371	A
that's uh kind of depressing to see all that	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah yeah- it's something you have to get used to i guess i mean i lived with that for a while and	2371	A
you just adapt	2371	A
to a certain extent here in the summer time we go back and forth between air-conditioned buildings there you go back and forth between warmed up areas i mean uh	2371	A
i remember when i was living in Indiana i was uh uh going- going to school there and i used to ride my bike across campus and one day it was it must've been close to ten degrees above zero and	2371	A
and i thought well if i ride my bike the wind chill will be close to zero it will last seven minutes six minutes if i walk it'll be ten degrees warmer but it will last twenty minutes	2371	A
which do i want you know it's colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a for a longer time and so i took the shorter colder option	2371	A
and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i weren't quite so sure at that point	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
oh yeah frostbite	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
oh yeah	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
it does	2371	A
you can feel all the way through it's like a knife like a sword- like a sword a sword slicing in half or whatever	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
yeah	2371	A
oh well i don't know what else i can say about it	2371	A
<silence>	2371	A
	2371	A
well i guess that's all i to say you too	2371	A
have a good evening bye	2371	A
	2371	A
	2376	B
there you go okay	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
right	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
oh i know it builds up really fast	2376	B
yeah yeah	2376	B
uh-huh	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
or it just builds up so often yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable	2376	B
so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic	2376	B
um and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town and they- they it just really every- every- every time you went by there it was just over flowing	2376	B
and so Wal-Mart complained	2376	B
so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be	2376	B
oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and they- they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there	2376	B
so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it	2376	B
you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area	2376	B
in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it's uh i think once or twice a week	2376	B
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message	2376	B
yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going	2376	B
	2376	B
 yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little	2376	B
um seedling to plant you know you could take the the	2376	B
mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
oh yeah it's really it adds up so fast yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah well they're working on diapers which would be great i've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful	2376	B
but now their saying that they're there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so	2376	B
the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off	2376	B
so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those	2376	B
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
	2376	B
	2376	B
yeah i don't know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don't really use that many tin cans i guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don't know if those are recyclable or	2376	B
um	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
yeah we don't either	2376	B
we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don't really have much of that but	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah well now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car	2376	B
or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it's not safe to put those things in the regular trash	2376	B
yeah yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
well other than that i'm not really sure we we try to recycle old clothes	2376	B
	2376	B
our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so	2376	B
yeah yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
oh	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
uh-huh kind of like a Goodwill kind of place yeah	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
yeah that's that's real helpful too	2376	B
 well i'm not sure of anything- i can't really think of anything else that we could recycle	2376	B
yeah	2376	B
<silence>	2376	B
okay	2376	B
you to take care bye-bye	2376	B
	2376	B
	2376	A
now i'm sorry excuse me	2376	A
and uh i do that we recycle uh newspapers we take you know the Dallas Morning News daily and the Plano paper daily and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers	2376	A
it really does i do recycle newspapers and uh glass	2376	A
we don't really have enough plastic to mess with we don't you know like we don't drink milk and we don't have children so we don't have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know	2376	A
yeah	2376	A
right	2376	A
but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container	2376	A
and uh Plano has plans i believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people's home and they can-	2376	A
it certainly would and they can separate it and then the you know trash guys will pick it up	2376	A
which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can't or don't drive you know they can't get to the these centers	2376	A
and i'm sure rather than try to uh ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know	2376	A
but i think that's probably a good idea	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
that's right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh yes	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
yeah	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
great	2376	A
	2376	A
i bet it was	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
sure	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
yeah it's just a matter of education i think	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
yeah yeah that's right	2376	A
i think basically it's a good idea you know i hope it works	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
absolutely absolutely	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
sure absolutely	2376	A
and there's just you know the two of us my wife and i and it's amazing how much stuff just- just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
it really does	2376	A
as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don't really i don't really know i really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
that's right i was uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
that's right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
yeah	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
 uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
i see	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
oh i'm sure it must yes you know i'm not personally involved because i don't you know i don't have any children that wear diapers but i'm sure it creates a large amount of you know uh refuse	2376	A
that's right that's right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
absolutely	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
that's right absolutely absolutely	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
i think they're made out of aluminum	2376	A
yes there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum but again we don't we don't generate that much so we don't	2376	A
yeah	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
that's right	2376	A
that ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
that's right	2376	A
car batteries	2376	A
uh-huh	2376	A
i don't you know i don't change my own oil so i don't i don't uh don't have that problem	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
yeah	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh yeah well we do to as a matter of fact	2376	A
right	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
yeah	2376	A
yes we have one of those in town uh-huh	2376	A
you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and there's a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the uh	2376	A
it's called the clothes closet that's what it's called here in Plano right uh-huh and they distribute them to the people that need them	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
uh-huh yeah	2376	A
<silence>	2376	A
no i can't either i really can't um	2376	A
no i i really can't either	2376	A
okay well it was nice talking to you	2376	A
-okay	2376	A
uh-huh bye-bye	2376	A
	2376	A
want me to press the one button	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
okay sir	2310	A
	2310	A
Jack do you have any pets	2310	A
Jim i'm sorry about that do you have any pets	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
okay well that would kind of preclude having a pet	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
uh-huh	2310	A
well we've got we've got a cat and this is a very very special cat because uh we lived in the Philippines for thirty months we worked for TI in in Biejo City	2310	A
in the Philippines and uh as you know uh the Filipinos are quite poor	2310	A
and and uh they don't uh generally they eat their pets	2310	A
uh well not generally but dogs they do uh so having a pet uh is is a luxury most of them don't have and we uh were able to find one that was born in a store	2310	A
and the uh a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away and we took him home with us when he was uh about three weeks old	2310	A
and uh ultimately my family moved back to Dallas and i had to stay on in the Philippines ten months after they went back	2310	A
and uh eventually i shipped him home by air and you know you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred and forty dollars to ship him across the ocean	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
yeah there was no problem because there was a veterinarian in our neighborhood and we had all the proper paperwork and and i shipped him uh uh by air	2310	A
and uh let my family know when he was going to be in and they went out to the freight claiming area out at uh DFW airport and claimed him	2310	A
it was it was it was it was pretty interesting uh did you have any pets when you were growing up	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
oh okay what did you have	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
um-hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
um-hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
um-hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
oh yeah	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
yeah	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
yeah they they they lived outdoors and you know	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
um-hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
oh yeah	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
yeah they're- they're	2310	A
and it's amazing how they how they adapt to the outside i was raised in New England and we had an Eskimo Spitz	2310	A
and he was never in the house a day in his life and i can you know i remember like this sounds like old grandfather stories but i can remember thirty five below zero and thirty inches of snow on the ground	2310	A
and	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
huh	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
um-hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
oh okay	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
um-hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
oh for goodness sakes yeah uh the only dog we ever had uh we lived prior to living in the Philippines with TI we lived in Malaysia	2310	A
and we were told when we got there that it'd be good to get a dog because uh there were a lot of uh breaking and entering and robberies	2310	A
and the uh native Malays by religion are scared of dogs in fact the lick of a dog is supposed to be something very very bad something very evil	2310	A
so what happened uh was anybody that had a dog at least the native Malays made up fifty percent of the population if you had a dog uh you wouldn't get ripped off by a Malay	2310	A
now the other fifty percent was part- some Chinese some Indians and they might then they didn't have any qualms- any qualms about dogs so we went down to the local SPCA	2310	A
uh the American association in in Gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an SPCA there and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet	2310	A
uh except the only problem is we played badminton in the yard a lot and we used to have to get the little shovel and scoop and go clean the yard at night before we went and play badminton	2310	A
but i'm i'm a runner by by hobby and she used to love to get outside the gate and i'd put her leash on and take her running with me	2310	A
and it was only years later i read that you shouldn't do it particularly in the tropical climates where we were and when she came back she'd drink about three panfuls of water	2310	A
but anyway- it wasn't it wasn't in the heat of the day i'd always go running about seven o'clock in the evening or something like that but boy she was ready i'd get that leash and she'd come over and start jumping all over me to get ready to go	2310	A
and and	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
oh yeah	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
oh for goodness sake	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
um-hum	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
right	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
i'm sure	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
well we we we live in a in a in a residential neighborhood and the animals pretty well run a lot of people have fences in their backyards and and dogs are kept inside fences uh cat cats are pretty well on the run	2310	A
fortunately people are responsible and they've all been spayed or neutered so we don't have gigantic litters of kittens running around here but they uh it's interesting the lady across from us has always taken in strays and she's got six or seven cats	2310	A
and one of her cats somehow or other must have get into our house accidentally	2310	A
uh when the door was open and found where our cat's food dish is and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers and when i pull my car up in the evening i can hear him she leaves her garage door open most of them_1 sleep in the garage at night	2310	A
and no matter what time of night it is he hears my car stop and he's over here and he's forcing his head in the door when i open the door and i go in he goes in he gets a great big mouthful of food because_1 he knows i'm going to pick him up right off and put him back out again and some days	2310	A
he'll follow me up the front walk so i'll run around the back of the house and try to go in the back door and he'll he'll go around and beat me there so i've got so that now i fake him i make a move toward the back so he runs around the back then i go in the front door	2310	A
so i- i can i can get in without him but he's he's he's fat as a	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
yeah he's he's he's	2310	A
he's fat as a little pig and she took him to the vet and the vet said you got to stop feeding him so much or he's going to die of a heart attack and so she said to me you've got to stop feeding and i said i don't do it intentionally i and if i'm in the house	2310	A
already sometimes i can keep him out if i'm trying to come in the house and he's trying to come in too i just kind of put my foot out uh against his neck while i'm i'm trying to uh get in the door and that works	2310	A
but other times i'll forget that he's out there at the door and as soon as i open it to go out he's by me like a shot and by the time i can get him he's got a great big gigantic mouthful of food	2310	A
<silence>	2310	A
no i- i think i- i- i think he he likes our food best uh somehow or another our cat has become a housecat	2310	A
and he uh he sleeps with us he sleeps with my wife and i and either he sleeps across the foot of the bed on top of either my feet or her feet or above the covers	2310	A
and uh except when it's extremely cold and we don't get many days like that here in Texas	2310	A
<silence>	2310	B
i'm ready whenever you are	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
Jim	2310	B
	2310	B
no no i do not i uh i live in an apartment	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
well	2310	B
well not really most of my neighbors	2310	B
have pets dogs	2310	B
of course	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
i agree and how they you know the uh	2310	B
the uh health officials let him in the country	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
i always had pets when i grew up	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
oh i had uh i started with a	2310	B
cat	2310	B
uh an old you know alley cat an old Tom but i had dogs primarily and uh	2310	B
mostly purebreds	2310	B
but uh	2310	B
we had a large yard	2310	B
and uh we did not have the pets in the house	2310	B
uh they all they were always outdoors	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
but i had a cat i have a i had a cat uh	2310	B
uh when i was living in in uh Pensacola Florida uh we had a uh cat that	2310	B
i got from- again from a friend it was born in a barn	2310	B
uh it was they had a a small farm so there were lots of cats around	2310	B
so i picked out one and got it for my daughter and uh had it uh spayed and	2310	B
declawed	2310	B
and we did keep it in the house	2310	B
restricted to the uh first floor	2310	B
and it was uh not a bad experience but for the most part i'm i'm reluctant to have animals in the house i just i just don't do not feel that	2310	B
particularly dogs uh i do not feel that they	2310	B
fare well	2310	B
uh in the in the house	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
um-hum well i yeah i had a malamute at one time	2310	B
and uh stayed outside	2310	B
i was raised in southern West Virginia	2310	B
so the winters would get fairly cold the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would	2310	B
sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night and uh you know it's uh	2310	B
wolf origins uh came to the fore particularly during the full moon and but i always had uh dogs i had a terrier	2310	B
first and then i had a uh	2310	B
let's see i had a terrier then i had a cocker spaniel	2310	B
then a	2310	B
then the uh malamute	2310	B
and then the last dog i had was a uh basset hound	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
but they all stayed outside	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
um-hum	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
um-hum	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
um	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
 right	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
um-hum	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
yeah i bet	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
well the you know the last one we had the the uh my uh	2310	B
my father owned a plumbing and heating business and my brother and i	2310	B
frequently worked for him during the summer when my brother was in college and i was in high school	2310	B
and so uh this was the only dog that we trained to ride in the automobile	2310	B
and so we used to take it to work with us when we would go on a job	2310	B
pack it a lunch	2310	B
and it would you know get out of the car and find a nice cool spot to rest and	2310	B
my brother and i would go work and we'd come uh	2310	B
break for lunch and and the uh	2310	B
unpack the dog's lunch and so forth and the other workers the	2310	B
the carpenters and so forth used to get just a hell of a charge out of it	2310	B
	2310	B
you know with a dog and bringing a dog on the job and they didn't realize we were working for my father so that uh	2310	B
it was uh but the people around here they're you know as i mention them the uh the neighbors a lot of the neighbors have uh	2310	B
pets	2310	B
of course they you see them out walking every evening but they range you know the couple upstairs that uh above me uh has a long hair dachshund	2310	B
uh the lady is German	2310	B
but uh there are some huge dogs around here it's really phenomenal i cannot see i mean i've seen everything from	2310	B
you know Great Danes and German Shepherds and just really huge animals and how they keep them confined	2310	B
uh the the apartments are are fine they're relatively large but	2310	B
to stay there all day is fantastic- you know fantastic	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
um-hum	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
it's amazing- yeah it's amazing how they get conditioned it it really is	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
well he might be canvassing the neighborhood you just might be the last stop on his uh on his route during the day	2310	B
	2310	B
<silence>	2310	B
	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
well let's see well we assume i was an adult twenty years ago um	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
uh yeah definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote not vote that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years um yeah twenty years ago was nineteen seventy uh nineteen seventy i had been married two years	2379	B
um we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty eight	2379	B
and uh around here on the uh east coast uh we were heavy into affirmative action	2379	B
and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people	2379	B
and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself	2379	B
um i was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated	2379	B
and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company	2379	B
uh the problem was that my hair was too long	2379	B
and uh that you weren't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard and uh you know jeans just flat out weren't allowed unless you worked on night stock and	2379	B
 if you wanted to get ahead with the company well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months if you were white male you're talking six years	2379	B
and that's basically where i ended up i uh i just flat out couldn't get a hold you know get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action um	2379	B
on other fronts um	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
um i think so i- i i i stopped working for them in uh seventy eight seventy nine	2379	B
and uh it's i think they're they're like all companies well represented and uh you know everything seems to be fine i i've kind of lost touch with the company we had a falling out but uh	2379	B
as far as uh as their management goes um i'm not sure they're any any better off than they were were before management wise	2379	B
but uh other changes um	2379	B
just	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
people seem to be more	2379	B
outspoken now individually rather than collectively um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home and things were more organized	2379	B
and uh i've noticed that	2379	B
now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
um	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
yeah i'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade and uh everybody was into me and then we are getting back into us but um it it	2379	B
it's i've seen uh	2379	B
uh a great deal of change as far as um	2379	B
corporate responsibility and things um	2379	B
and	2379	B
people's response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more	2379	B
and what about- what about the last ten years that you've been aware	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
uh-huh	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
yes	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
yes	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
 but even uh i think uh along the line of the uh goals of civil rights um	2379	B
there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone i mean you know	2379	B
you know don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't you know it's just something that always sets people off you know you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent	2379	B
	2379	B
and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent so um but i- i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um	2379	B
it's it's been a long time coming um being a uh a very old hippie um	2379	B
i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life no matter what you do and i- i just	2379	B
i've seen a lot of changes i mean from the original earth day	2379	B
and um i'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling we recycle paper and cans here at work and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and	2379	B
you know all that stuff at home and i'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
 yeah	2379	B
like	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
yeah	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
and then they	2379	B
turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war	2379	B
and now we got to the point where the junkyards you've got to pay them to take something there so things have really changed a lot i think the uh the other part about uh America's decline i think has to do with	2379	B
yeah the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system	2379	B
uh i have children in in school- i have three children in school right now and i'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them uh i had when i was down in Dallas for two years i had uh	2379	B
my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong	2379	B
and words spelled wrong not marked as such	2379	B
and this person's teaching my children	2379	B
you know i had a real problem with that	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
yeah	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
yeah	2379	B
<silence>	2379	B
um i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland but they're trying to get a uh a uh	2379	B
a merit system here in Maryland rather than a uh tenure system	2379	B
for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools	2379	B
so that the teach	2379	B
	2379	A
so uh tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
	2379	A
well you're you're able to you're able to uh vote and go to war and things like that so	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
oh that's right that's one of the changes	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
 yes	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
and is the company now uh well represented uh demographically at the higher echelons did it work	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
um-hum	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
um-hum	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
so there's less you think now there's less of a a social movement and more individual movements- lots of individual movements in a sense	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
the me decade uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
well that i've been aware of i've	2379	A
at least in my own circles i've been aware of an increasing from my generation i don't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you but half generation off i guess um	2379	A
i've noticed uh	2379	A
a certain increase um pessimism with America no longer being sort of on top i had the impression	2379	A
	2379	A
well i mean there was the quote unquote losing of the Vietnam war which was a blow and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially you know a socially conscious adult and	2379	A
i realize that people of my age have no um	2379	A
no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and um major social change in that sense and i	2379	A
and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood have been more incremental	2379	A
they've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of Martin Luther King or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population	2379	A
and there's just instead there's been sort of an increasing oh i don't know Japan bashing and things like that	2379	A
and uh a lot of i see	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know America's losing it	2379	A
and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowledge- uh a lack of understanding how that could be	2379	A
and in the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and um	2379	A
so i see i see a lot of uh a lot of pessimism growing um	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
and at the same time i think there's there's there's a growing environmentalist movement	2379	A
and sense of corporate responsible- increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in in the near future	2379	A
in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that such that you know people cause thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now i mean my generation doesn't	2379	A
can't rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes there's still some racism but	2379	A
you know basically things are the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of and there's a notion of fairness that um while still far from perfect is much more established i think	2379	A
	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
oh of course it's human nature	2379	A
	2379	A
yeah yeah	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh yes	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh yeah yeah	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh right	2379	A
and that's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else i mean all this recycling used to be in tact or not all of it but much of it did i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
yes yes	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
a perceived decline anyway yeah	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
yeah	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
yeah well i'd i'd say actually i mean as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the	2379	A
role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been	2379	A
poorer and poorer over the years uh you know that there's been cost of living increases but not quite in proportion to cost of living and you know it's just more and more uh	2379	A
 a real low income sort of job and very low prestige i mean there's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything and if you have that kind of social attitude it's	2379	A
hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education	2379	A
and you get more and more people who would just end up there because it's uh it's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
<silence>	2379	A
uh-huh	2379	A
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
okay	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
well i	2363	B
i can see both sides of that issue and i think that uh it's just a necessary evil is basically what it comes down to	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
the uh costs are just going out of sight and and uh you know it's either increase the premiums or try to uh	2363	B
everybody work together to try to curtail the cost that's the way i see it	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yes i do	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
we've used it quite a bit in the past when our kids were smaller but uh	2363	B
i don't use it that much either uh of course i'm using it right now i had a little skiing accident here in this last month and so i'm taking advantage of it right now	2363	B
yeah i cracked a collarbone separated the shoulder a little bit	2363	B
nothing too major	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
no no i didn't even miss work just sling- stick it in a sling and go on	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
huh-uh	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
i tell you getting back to the benefits	2363	B
i was just thinking about uh something uh uh kind of close to one of our guys in H R D their personnel and they uh	2363	B
he's been talking about this thing called flex benefits for quite a while and uh i think that's a interesting concept	2363	B
ever heard of that	2363	B
 be kind of like	2363	B
smorgasbord of benefits where you could uh tailor your benefit package to your own individual needs and so forth	2363	B
in other words if you were uh interested in having more vacation you could do that and then take cutback a little bit on some uh other area	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
or uh you know increase your hospital benefits if you were in had a lot kids or something like that or	2363	B
or in your case you might want to cut the hospital back a little bit and	2363	B
yeah whatever i mean it's uh you know across the board	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
it's a	2363	B
yeah it's something they talked about for several years now i don't know if that he are getting any closer the problem is that some people might go a little bit overboard	2363	B
in picking out what they want and	2363	B
leave themselves	2363	B
too short in other areas i guess	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
well in most cases i'd have to agree with you i think the uh profit sharing is a little uh	2363	B
a little lacking right now	2363	B
and for the past few years	2363	B
but like they always say you know got a good profit sharing plan just no profit	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
well i've had a few	2363	B
good years but not too many	2363	B
in the fifteen i've been here	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
oh yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah it's a good company i don't know what division your in but we uh	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
oh really	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
i got a i got a bone to pick with the programmer on that new time program	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
well i think it's a great concept but i think you've uh you've left too many uh	2363	B
uh i'm a supervisor and i approve- i approve the uh the thing it it just doesn't make logical sense you know in other words	2363	B
it always keep jumping back up to the person	2363	B
you know where you enter your own number- ID number	2363	B
the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so that's the one you're going to do the next action on the change you know	2363	B
and there's a lot of little things like that in there	2363	B
but	2363	B
it it could probably be corrected easily i don't know if anybody's griped about it or not	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah i think the concept's great you know	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
i'll bet yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
 yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
fourteen	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
but they've kept you hopping there	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
oh yeah i think it's uh	2363	B
definitely got good definitely got a right idea	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
well	2363	B
that's that's one of the benefits that i uh	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
you know question	2363	B
	2363	B
well you know knowing a little bit about programming and a little bit about the time system and the way it was before and everything i just could see where he could made it so much better you know just by	2363	B
a few little more	2363	B
	2363	B
i don't know what you'd say attention to the to the right detail and stuff	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
hum	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
uh too bad	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
well they made it uh extremely uh easy for the employee yeah i can just	2363	B
especially if it's standard week they can just don't even have to get in hardly to log on to it just to put the initial command and then their employee number and away it goes	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah working with it it's uh you can see some areas that could be improved	2363	B
i think they must have worked on it because i've noticed one correction come through already it looks like	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
man	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
	2363	B
that's all right	2363	B
no i'm not the	2363	B
i only worry with it one time a week when i'm well twice really	2363	B
	2363	B
when i'm approving and then it's uh	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
 i've had a chance to	2363	B
i had a chance to terminate and uh L O A and back to L O A	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
yeah right	2363	B
	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
just	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
um-hum	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
yeah	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
speaking of uh let's see big corporate benefits i wonder if uh	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
i wonder if they looked- uh have you ever heard of this {administaff} type thing this staff leasing that a lot of companies do	2363	B
<silence>	2363	B
they uh	2363	B
that's kind of uh	2363	B
new thing that come along and uh	2363	B
benefit well they uh what they do is uh well i guess it's basically for smaller companies that don't want to have all the	2363	B
payroll hassle and everything	2363	B
you fire all your people and they uh they hire them_1 then they lease them back to you and they do all the paperwork and provide the benefit	2363	B
of course they have	2363	B
<silence>	2363	A
i- i like our benefits	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
i'm pretty satisfied with them_1 uh	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
the only thing that i think i would change is the network the hospital networking i have Aetna Insurance	2363	A
you know the company insurance and- and	2363	A
i would- i just think i should- would like to go to my own hospital where my doctor is rather than have to go to a hospital on a list that's the only thing i have against it	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
what is that what is it because of because of expense is that	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah do you do you use Aetna	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah you know it's pretty good they're really fast on paying	2363	A
uh all my claims you know i don't use it that much to be real honest with you i'm alone and and you know it's hard for me i don't go to the doctor unless i'm really sick and i don't get sick that much so you know sometimes i don't even come up with the deductible	2363	A
in a year	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
 you	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
oh no are you did you break something	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
	2363	A
oh my God	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
oh did you are you on L O A	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
you didn't	2363	A
	2363	A
um oh my gosh well some guy killed himself today or yesterday in a skiing accident somebody up here he's head of oh welfare- not welfare but	2363	A
probations or something on i can't think of what he's the head of uh he skied into a tree	2363	A
and killed himself forty one years old	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
so	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
okay	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
uh-huh uh	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
huh	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
have more vacation	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
huh i hadn't heard of that	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah yeah well uh i think TI has good benefits	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
think we have	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
oh yeah well	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
but no profits right now- i think when- when we when we start showing profit which i hope we do pretty soon um that you know because at one time they had good profit sharing from what i understand i- i didn't get in on it unfortunately	2363	A
but	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
see i've only been here four	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
but but i really like working for their TI i think	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
uh i hate to tell you i'm in payroll	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
 but uh i	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
i love it you don't like it	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
huh	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
oh we get gripes but all in all it it works pretty good for everybody you know	2363	A
and it and i'm sure there are some bugs in it and eventually maybe they'll work them_1 out it it's been a tough year to get this all done and get everybody on it and	2363	A
it's uh	2363	A
but it's showing it's rewards now i think uh oh the stop pays and people coming off of L O A and everything people are really getting the hang of it now	2363	A
yes boy in the beginning what division are you in	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
oh fourteen well okay division one was worse because_1 that's the biggest division and boy when we put them on oh my God the phone you'd hang up and it would ring it was just bad	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah yeah but it's it's doing pretty well now i think everybody's	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
see i don't have to go in and approve time okay so i i really	2363	A
don't know what y'all are going through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybody's time i didn't do it before and i don't do it now so i don't have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with people- with everybody	2363	A
and and being able to see what you are doing and everything it's really been a a a godsend it's been wonderful getting everybody on the same system it's been great and an easy system that everybody seems to be able to learn you know it's been really good	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
 that's a TI benefit new	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
now i don't know who planned it all or how- i don't even know how they came about	2363	A
uh agreeing on what all to do and with i know they're were programmers involved and i know the manager and	2363	A
the two managers and uh payroll were involved in supervisors and all but uh i came in last year out of one of the shops so uh it was all new to me i had to learn the old system and the new system	2363	A
 that was fun	2363	A
that was fun and then after i had finally got it all down they said now forget the old system oh yeah sure thanks a lot so so for me the new system really was	2363	A
was easier you know it really it really was is easier to work i think	2363	A
so but that's just from my point of view like i said i don't have to sit down and depending- depending on how many work rooms you have and everything you know it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah	2363	A
yeah but you have to go in and and individually check everybody	2363	A
	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
they're several things that have uh changed already on it and now you're going to ask me what and i can't tell you offhand i just know we've had several changes it just	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
yeah	2363	A
yeah well	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
that i think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on was stopping and starting people's pay mainly because you can do it now and it's easy and it's so easy that people go	2363	A
was that all i have to do it you know there's got to be something else i have to do and i'm no it's just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before	2363	A
for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number and you got it you know so uh just put people in pick a number and put people in it and it's a work group so you know i think uh it's really a lot simpler than the old one	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
hum-um	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
uh-huh	2363	A
<silence>	2363	A
	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
uh i'd like to think i am it's it's been a while now	2331	B
yeah i've uh	2331	B
oh just recently i got married and we bought a house we're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time	2331	B
so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh swung a club for a purpose	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
right	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
right	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
that's that's great yeah	2331	B
no it's uh i could say it's been a while for me too i uh i've got my wife motivated about it um	2331	B
and uh i think that's probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs and uh we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
really	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
well great great that's good	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah same thing here	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
right right	2331	B
um-hum yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
that's i've got the same attitude i uh	2331	B
i tell you i- i started i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college	2331	B
and uh i took uh took it as a PE course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school and	2331	B
since then uh we've made it um as as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of uh having a a Thursday	2331	B
or well have have probably like a like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding	2331	B
and uh so it that's back in South Dakota where i grew up and uh so that that's uh that's been my main my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here but uh	2331	B
eventually i get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then i'll show them_1 that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yep yep	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
oh -okay	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah that's right	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
oh it is- it's it's a lot of fun especially- especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that's- that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or	2331	B
racquetball	2331	B
right and and people don't want to play with somebody that they're going to beat every time you know and and uh and	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
right	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
that's right yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
that's true	2331	B
that's true	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
well	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
that that that's uh	2331	B
yeah that's absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you	2331	B
you- you know you you get stuck- you get in a rut if- if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then uh	2331	B
you know you've basically tapped your resources there	2331	B
but uh i'd i'd like to uh eventually i'd like to work- work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
right	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
uh-huh	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
sure	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
right	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
well that's good that's good that sounds like a lot of fun	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah it it sounds like we've got real similar situations uh i i go home uh i've gone home every year now since i've moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh	2331	B
um the the last time i i took my wife along and uh kind- kind of the same situation she sat- she sat in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but	2331	B
she'll definitely uh she'll make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along but uh	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
it's uh that's interesting though	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
that's right	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
that's right well yeah that's i've i've kind of formed the attitude that you know if- if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh	2331	B
out of my game every time and put them_1 together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and	2331	B
i keep i keep rationalizing well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then it'll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing and	2331	B
it it it really works that way	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
sure	2331	B
sure	2331	B
yeah that's great	2331	B
<silence>	2331	B
well you bet	2331	B
okay sounds like it	2331	B
okay bye	2331	B
	2331	B
	2331	A
are you a player	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
is it	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
um	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah i haven't- i haven't played in about two years and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here i work at TI and i played in a tournament out there and i shot a net fifty nine they were kind of little upset	2331	A
but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits	2331	A
i have a hard time inventing shots you know let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can't do that so i i finally got out and i've been watching quite a few videos i	2331	A
hadn't been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i	2331	A
i hope i'm on the right track you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicap's twenty i-	2331	A
i like the	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
really	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah i've tried to get my wife i bought her a set of clubs four years ago she hasn't even swung them but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day she's	2331	A
she's ready to get off into it but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors and i'm a hunter and a fisher anyway but you know i- you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf and	2331	A
it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really	2331	A
and i you know i walk i don't ride so you know i get a little exercise there too so	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
right	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
oh	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah it's pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed	2331	A
you know here it is sixty five degrees we're out playing golf and they're freezing cold back there so	2331	A
but i uh picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a PE course and then when i got into the service i got into it	2331	A
and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf i said well yeah you know i've got my clubs but i haven't swung them_1 in quite a few years	2331	A
and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there	2331	A
you know i really enjoy it it's really nice	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah you don't want to go out and get beat to death but	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
no	2331	A
and then you know we've got some guys here they're you know four and five handicappers and they don't like to play with me because_1 i'm too slow for them_1 so	2331	A
you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time	2331	A
and i've you know i've never never yet have i walked up now i've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their	2331	A
twosome or threesome you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying well you know let me teach- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or	2331	A
you know it's it's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can't find that in all sports	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
right	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah you need to	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
oh yeah we we have one down here in the summertime uh it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock you know because_1 it doesn't get dark -until nine thirty or ten	2331	A
and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed league in and that's what i'm trying to get her ready for it's going to start well when we we change the time back whenever that is next month i guess	2331	A
and it'll start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting a hundred a hundred and twenty but they were	2331	A
you know now they're down into the hundreds nineties so it won't take her long	2331	A
you know	2331	A
and it's something we can do together so	2331	A
well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
um-hum	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
all right	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah and it's you know it's a game that you don't like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you don't have to be an expert to play any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right	2331	A
so you know you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
<silence>	2331	A
and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because_1 i knew i could do something and i didn't get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway	2331	A
now you know the ball'll go straight and i go i never broke a club or anything but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don't get upset any more so	2331	A
and	2331	A
well i enjoyed talking to you	2331	A
i guess i'll go back to work	2331	A
all right see you later bud bye-bye	2331	A
	2331	A
okay	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
no i don't like the metric system	2324	B
i- i- i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background the history of our country has been inches and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system	2324	B
it it's gonna disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand	2324	B
um you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and	2324	B
it's it's not in our national consciousness to do it we've always measured things in the English system	2324	B
	2324	B
and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
i mean- it's	2324	B
	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
	2324	B
and it's easy to translate- we have a computer for just about everything now and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them_1 it can be done	2324	B
because i'm a mechanical engineer and i've had to work when i was designing packages for people i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard	2324	B
and you get you can get a CAD CAM system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every	2324	B
	2324	B
measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
really	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
absolutely	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
oh yeah it's just	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think it's still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools	2324	B
	2324	B
you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that	2324	B
and and that's acceptable	2324	B
because	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
really	2324	B
yeah-	2324	B
you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
 and it it just doesn't yeah it doesn't make that much difference in the average life in the scientific community and places where it's needed	2324	B
you know that's fine and the rest of the world i mean we are uh we- if not we may not be the top i don't know if we're the top we're one of the superpowers of the world	2324	B
it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us	2324	B
	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
yeah it it's kind of like expecting- expecting everyone to suddenly speak German	2324	B
you know	2324	B
	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
 okay_1	2324	B
yeah i -it's been nice talking to you	2324	B
 okay_1	2324	B
	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
	2324	B
<silence>	2324	B
 all right	2324	B
-well good talking to you	2324	B
bye bye	2324	B
	2324	B
	2324	A
okay_1 um why do you think it um failed do you think we should adopt it	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
you don't	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
um-hum	2324	A
	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
right	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah i agree- i agree with you i don't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of America	2324	A
and also the um i don't know it seems almost like there's this it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations	2324	A
because i think they that's an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like oh we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet	2324	A
and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it's like hey we're content with this no it's probably not as accurate probably	2324	A
you know intellectually doesn't it's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on i had six years of college and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it and i'm not some kind of an idiot i just	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
um-hum	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
right	2324	A
there's a lot of people like you're educated i'm educated my husband is	2324	A
but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated	2324	A
and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college or i don't know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population	2324	A
they don't have any college probably much at all and if we can't take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and	2324	A
you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as as much sharpness and mental- mental acuity	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
um-hum	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
right	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think Americans have so much stress on them_1 right now	2324	A
i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this and it's like i mean come on let's take the pressure off	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah and it's just like another thing the American family doesn't need any more pressure just leave them_1 alone let them_1 measure their green bean water in cups and leave them_1 alone	2324	A
i don't know	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
uh-huh that's	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
	2324	A
	2324	A
and and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our don't worry about it and i think	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
right it is because_1 it is another language yeah	2324	A
<silence>	2324	A
	2324	A
	2324	A
that's funny well that's good -well i think we kept it at real good	2324	A
	2324	A
is that all we need to say	2324	A
you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean	2324	A
and we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania and we were talking about something totally- income tax or something and i just	2324	A
anyway the i appreciate it have a good day	2324	A
	2324	A
	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
 really i like it	2358	A
i- i like um	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
 um um working with flowers and stuff like that	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
oh just mowing the mowing the yard	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
	2358	A
that's probably why you hate it so much	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
uh-huh	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
i kind of enjoy working out in the yard i- i enjoy working out in the yard i mean in the summertime it's hard here because_1 it gets so hot	2358	A
you have to like get up at six o'clock in the morning if you're going to mow the yard and not faint while your doing it	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
 no no i'm married	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
well we both do sometimes	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
well we're we're moving to a new house and so we'll we'll have to get started over there	2358	A
decide what we're going to plant and everything at the at the old house we had a lot of roses	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
um-hum	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
	2358	A
it does get really hot here	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
uh-huh	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
we tried that last year and but we hadn't lived here in Dallas for you know long enough to	2358	A
to remember that you have to do like um i have this sister who lives in Florida and she plants her garden in January harvest in May	2358	A
plant again in um late September	2358	A
and then harvest like in December	2358	A
yeah that's right because the summertime you just can't grow anything and we tried to plant in like end of March or April and everything just toasted i mean it just	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
oh here it gets so hot i mean this stuff just burns to a crisp what	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
probably late January	2358	A
right when it just as soon as it stops freezing	2358	A
	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
because_1 you know i mean last summer	2358	A
the only way you could keep something keep a keep a garden growing last summer was to water it all day long every day and because_1 it would just it would just burn to a crisp	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
oh yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
um-hum	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
why did he make you do it	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
 well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when they're big enough you can have them go do the yard and you can do what you want to do	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
	2358	A
no but he will be	2358	A
	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
well i- i didn't seem to have that experience i mean they were already there but we just fed them and watered them	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
no	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
oh well like i said we tried last year but we didn't do it right	2358	A
	2358	A
and it's going to be too late this year by the time we get moved so we'll probably wait and maybe in the fall we might plant a fall garden this year	2358	A
but we're not going to try to do anything during the summertime because_1 it is just too hot	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
um-hum	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah that's what i said you know summer- during the summertime you've got to get up at six o'clock in the morning	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
to do it before you know before it gets hot and one time last year i remember we were planning on doing that and it was eighty degrees even then	2358	A
oh it was just awful	2358	A
 and so humid	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
oh no because were fixing to move	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
really	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
yeah	2358	A
oh yeah	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
um-hum	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
	2358	A
<silence>	2358	A
 nice talking to you too	2358	A
thanks oh thanks	2358	A
	2358	A
bye-bye	2358	A
	2358	A
	2358	B
okay i don't know about you but i hate to do yard work and i pay somebody to do all of my yard work	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
yeah	2358	B
do you	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
oh well i- i	2358	B
 i don't mind doing like gardening or just stuff like that but i'm just regular cutting the grass and	2358	B
i always told my dad when i was a kid and he made me do it i said i can't wait until i'm old enough so i don't have to do this anymore	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
because_1 i always had to do it and so i just pay someone else to do it and they do the they do the cutting they fertilize they um edge and um i think this year i'm going to have some landscaping put in	2358	B
so i don't know i don't i i'm single and- and- and- and so i don't know i don't	2358	B
if i had a a man around to do it it might be different i don't know	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
pardon me	2358	B
do you	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
um-hum	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
	2358	B
do you cut the grass and stuff	2358	B
you do you live by yourself	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
but you still do it anyway	2358	B
you both do it that's nice	2358	B
do you have um a lot of flowers and stuff	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
oh	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
um those are pretty	2358	B
i- i used to have a house that had a really it was really well landscaped and i- i enjoyed the flowers and the and the trees the things this	2358	B
house doesn't have very much it has some trees but um who lived here before didn't put in anything in the way of shrubs or flowers but i think i am going to have that done	2358	B
have that done this year because i do enjoy looking at it i just	2358	B
i'm not i don't tolerate the heat well	2358	B
i much prefer to stay in the house in my air conditioning and look at it without working in it	2358	B
although i have i did try one year um out here in Dallas but i lived i used to live in San Antonio and i did try growing- having a garden where i grew tomatoes and vegetables- different vegetables and that was kind of fun	2358	B
to get out and work and that	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
uh-huh	2358	B
uh-huh	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
ooh	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
isn't that when when are you i thought that was when you were supposed to plant	2358	B
when when are you supposed to plant it	2358	B
when- when are you supposed to plant then	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
really	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
um	2358	B
 i didn't realize that	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
yeah yeah	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
	2358	B
but um	2358	B
i don't know i've i	2358	B
	2358	B
i just prefer having someone else do it to me um you know i'd rather spend my time doing other things	2358	B
and i know my dad always enjoyed it he loved to work in the yard	2358	B
uh he made us do the grunt work	2358	B
my sister and me yeah he like he	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
that's what he yeah i- i can't tell you how many times i heard that	2358	B
	2358	B
about five more years maybe but um i don't know i don't know really	2358	B
it's interesting i don't i don't know part of the reason i think is that i don't know anything about it when i had my other house and it was already landscaped and i	2358	B
you know i didn't know what to do and how to take care of the things and you know i learned a little bit but um	2358	B
i heard roses- i heard that roses are really difficult to grow and they really take a lot of	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
you did you have any problem with bugs or anything like that	2358	B
well that's good have you have you ever grown any vegetables	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
um tomatoes- tomatoes	2358	B
	2358	B
yeah um	2358	B
hum	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
it's an interesting	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
i think it's an interesting you know it's an interesting hobby if um you know to have i just have never taken the time to learn to learn very much about it and	2358	B
you know but like i said i don't tolerate the heat and the	2358	B
	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
oh i see-	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
at six o'clock yeah yeah i know	2358	B
have you had to start your work on your yard this year yet cutting it and stuff	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
i just had mine done for the first time last week yeah	2358	B
so it's getting to be i- i usually have it done about every other week	2358	B
and i don't know now it's not growing real fast it will pick up	2358	B
it's just getting green um i prefer to see green than brown	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
but	2358	B
<silence>	2358	B
well it was nice talking to you	2358	B
and good luck on your moving and your garden thanks	2358	B
 bye-bye	2358	B
	2358	B
	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh constantly	2372	B
	2372	B
 it seems like uh everything i do has- is computer related	2372	B
and if it goes down then we're stuck all day	2372	B
and so i like the IBM PC personally	2372	B
but that's pretty much everything i've worked with and uh i've become so accustomed to it that uh it's like- second nature	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
what do you use	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
yes uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
huh-uh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh okay	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh okay	2372	B
oh we um we use an it's an IBM PS two also	2372	B
and um	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i'd like	2372	B
uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um	2372	B
 graphics on it	2372	B
and uh	2372	B
a little with word processing and then lotus- uh lotus applications to it	2372	B
and uh	2372	B
uh you know i don't know i just	2372	B
i enjoy working with them	2372	B
there's just there's so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
 we have one at home but i just don't find the time that i can use it	2372	B
i	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
	2372	B
yes uh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
	2372	B
oh the- one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i	2372	B
am pretty much the uh like you said the guru in the office uh with the uh the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is	2372	B
and um	2372	B
uh so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that uh in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so	2372	B
but uh you know it's uh	2372	B
they're they're really great uh it's almost like we could we could become too dependent on them	2372	B
and oh	2372	B
i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh	2372	B
that's uh	2372	B
pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things	2372	B
and um	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
it uh you know compared to what the uh the way the things have upgraded have uh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
really they're what's the word i'm looking for	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
i'm just totally drawing a blank we just but uh the way things have have changed over the years with the PC and the different programs is just great it's remarkable as far as the things that we can do now and compared to what we could do you know	2372	B
back a few years	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
yeah	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
 we think about that a lot	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
um now that's awful	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
huh-uh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh okay	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
um-hum right	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
hm yes	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
right the quality that you can put out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
yeah	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
um uh we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer	2372	B
and uh it's just so you- you know with budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult	2372	B
and	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
yeah	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred	2372	B
uh yeah i don't remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies	2372	B
sometimes the color would take too long to plot- uh to plot out	2372	B
so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick	2372	B
because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it	2372	B
but uh it uh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
no uh-huh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to to razzle-dazzle uh but uh	2372	B
it's uh yeah we we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to had to change it uh put it on a disk	2372	B
and carry it over to there and see if they're not using the the printer	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
right and uh wait for an opportunity to use it	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
i know i understand	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
oh uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
right	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
 right	2372	B
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind you know the times in technology here	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh	2372	B
we work for a computer company and uh	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated and when it's obsolete	2372	B
and the the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good	2372	B
so	2372	B
<silence>	2372	B
um-hum	2372	B
<silence>	2372	A
well how about you do you use PCs	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
you and i both	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
well i have an i an IBM PS two model thirty	2372	A
and uh it's kind of it's getting kind of too slow for me but my job i'm an EDP auditor so i audit uh computer applications both on the PC and the mainframe level	2372	A
and i just use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors	2372	A
i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine	2372	A
so all i have on my desk is my PC but i'm i'm getting not only our local area network but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines also	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah i've become kind of the PC guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground	2372	A
and there's uh three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other	2372	A
just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and	2372	A
so	2372	A
i i'm i couldn't live my life without a PC now i don't have one at home	2372	A
which- which-	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah i would- right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home	2372	A
um we've got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot	2372	A
to do work and if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah just the power i'm i'm trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and it's just not fast enough for me	2372	A
so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but i don't know	2372	A
i don't know if my boss will spring for it	2372	A
but i'm i'm i'm	2372	A
i determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one	2372	A
	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
well that's what i do we had a printer a a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer	2372	A
and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something	2372	A
so the first thing when i started work at this bank was i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up	2372	A
so i talked my boss into investing in a it's not a uh yeah	2372	A
a uh real elaborate local area network but we can share the printer	2372	A
and we can uh send mail- uh files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough it's what we need	2372	A
and then i talked them into buying a HP Laser Jet	2372	A
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased	2372	A
it's it's fast it's quite oh it has good copy	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah i've i've got a little little uh IBM Pro Printer on my desk but and i can use either the Pro Printer or i've got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own	2372	A
so if i just need something real quick and i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
they have gotten really cheap Hewlett Packard makes it's it's actually a dot matrix printer	2372	A
but the quality is almost uh laser quality	2372	A
and i think it's called the desk jet	2372	A
and they're under i think they're uh about eight hundred dollars now	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
oh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
i mean that's all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you don't need them in four colors	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah use the sneaker net system	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah we used to have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer	2372	A
until they got off the machine	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh	2372	A
well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came in and bought up the rival and now N C N B's got a little larger market share	2372	A
but it's the it's the only uh	2372	A
well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas it's the only one that's still alive	2372	A
so any way i work in a in a big prestigious place	2372	A
and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a HP Rugged Writer	2372	A
i was going oh wait a minute	2372	A
come on guys this is crummy	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah yeah we're we're pushing real hard though we're we're trying well see the the entire bank is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innovation- innovation and lead the market	2372	A
it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to to- do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
so	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
<silence>	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly like for instance we bought a	2372	A
okay um i guess um	2397	A
this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess	2397	A
but um	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
um well i've made a lot of baby gifts it seem like that's like especially lately there's been so many babies that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings	2397	A
um	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
isn't that funny no	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
yeah isn't that funny i guess i do have one thing um a friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i- i needlepointed the the face	2397	A
and i uh kept that because she gave me that so	2397	A
oh yeah and it's real neat	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
um basically the the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts	2397	A
and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
oh what's that	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
huh	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
wow well that's interesting what did you what kind of things did you do	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
uh-huh	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
oh	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
yeah	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
that- what did you call that	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i mean when you described it	2397	A
yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess	2397	A
but um i've never heard of it before and it's really interesting	2397	A
um i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows	2397	A
really	2397	A
 that's	2397	A
yeah it is	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons	2397	A
they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know	2397	A
yeah	2397	A
i've never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
um	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
oh definitely yeah	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
oh	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
oh	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
yeah	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
that's i think that's what my concern was you know wasn't really sure and how they would how they would last	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
 you're right no that's true though that's funny	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
yeah	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
	2397	A
oh i know	2397	A
	2397	A
 that's funny no i just um	2397	A
i don't i have really have gotten out of it i don't do it quite as much as i used to	2397	A
um i guess because i i went back to school so i don't have as much time	2397	A
	2397	A
it's so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i can't put it down i just	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
i know i started a project	2397	A
it's been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for Christmas and i	2397	A
 that's what i keep telling this person well i didn't tell you what year	2397	A
	2397	A
um well it's a it's uh cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work	2397	A
and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but	2397	A
not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard	2397	A
uh-huh uh well i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work yep	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
uh-huh	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
uh-huh	2397	A
yep	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
	2397	A
no that's true i i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard	2397	A
but i really do enjoy- like i said i really enjoy it when i do it's just hard	2397	A
uh-huh and there's there's so many other things that i	2397	A
i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs	2397	A
and wall hangings	2397	A
and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up	2397	A
and do them	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
no	2397	A
no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those	2397	A
and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's	2397	A
a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters	2397	A
if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah	2397	A
yeah	2397	A
there's yeah there's a a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh	2397	A
uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny	2397	A
it was really easy i mean just	2397	A
just did a thumb print you know	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
uh-huh	2397	A
	2397	A
<silence>	2397	A
uh-huh	2397	A
um-hum	2397	A
and then i just	2397	A
	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
oh really what kinds of things have you done	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
aha	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
do you ever keep any of your stuff	2397	B
 i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and and it it's kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work	2397	B
oh well can you go to so and so's house	2397	B
yes	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
ooh	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
that that would be definitely something you'd want to keep was was the whole face done or just the numbers uh and and like minute	2397	B
marks	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
oh	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the Bargello	2397	B
well it's an Italian um	2397	B
needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the	2397	B
uh hum the	2397	B
what what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used with- uh with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth	2397	B
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or	2397	B
whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to	2397	B
uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
what i did when when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth and	2397	B
i can't find one that i've done it it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves	2397	B
or or what and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished	2397	B
but i have no idea where they are	2397	B
bargello it's B A R G E double L O	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
i suspect you i suspect you have	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
me too yeah that's interesting	2397	B
how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny uh	2397	B
uh what how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the baskets- how were you decorating the baskets	2397	B
um	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
like fabric that's been stiffened in yes	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six	2397	B
and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly	2397	B
when i do um crochet it's it's usually the the lacy Victorian type	2397	B
things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it's like white glue	2397	B
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then	2397	B
um allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh	2397	B
uh high humidity	2397	B
in in a room	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
do you know what my concern is how will i dust this thing i'm terrible	2397	B
 so many of my crafts well right now i'm looking at a little uh	2397	B
uh quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be	2397	B
out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors uh and i hate to dust so that's the first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
oh you don't have time	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
you definitely don't have time	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
that	2397	B
i have a similar problem i've got to have time or i don't even want to get into it in the first place	2397	B
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
you just didn't say which Christmas right	2397	B
	2397	B
	2397	B
what was this project	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
now this is this is done in the needlepoint hm	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
yes yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but i've decided that that's something that demands my time my my total- my total attention	2397	B
and so i've got to have	2397	B
total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
oh	2397	B
i'm sure you'll get it done but it just maybe not on the original obviously not on the original time schedule	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
okay	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
um	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
that's what i would do too	2397	B
or or whatever i have that's	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
ooh	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
what	2397	B
with ink or oh okay	2397	B
<silence>	2397	B
oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just	2397	B
just like being finger printed	2397	B
	2304	A
all right what are some of your favorite foods i imagine with Argentina you've got some great foods	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A

uh-huh	2304	A
do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker	2304	A
it used to be in Georgetown years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to Argentina i guess in nineteen- the early seventies	2304	A
yes so that must- that's before your time your parents might remember if they were here then	2304	A
okay i mean he was wonderful i we used to get the most marvelous empenadas and other Argentine things	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
yeah i'm Italian	2304	A
uh-huh	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
yeah well because there're many Italians in Argentina	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
um-hum	2304	A
uh-huh yeah	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
my grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina this was around the turn of the century	2304	A
actually actually a little bit later like nineteen- uh nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
	2304	A
yeah well i'll tell you it's interesting because when we cook here i'm of Italian descent my husband is Chinese	2304	A
so we and we both love European- Continental cooking French cooking so we cook uh our meals are well we don't do- we don't usually mix i mean that's well sometimes well if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe	2304	A
and um there are really easy recipe that is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes	2304	A
and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i don't know if you have one	2304	A
and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it	2304	A
and chop some scallions and a little ginger	2304	A
and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and it's a wonderful	2304	A
um flavorful piece of fish yeah	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
um-hum	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
um-hum	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish market- uh the fish counter	2304	A
um uh any white fish sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good	2304	A
and even grouper	2304	A
little bit of soy sauce and sesame- sesame seed oil	2304	A
and not too much soy sauce uh some chopped up scallions- um you know slivers of scallions	2304	A
and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just	2304	A
just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes it's done don't overcook it though	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
yeah well till you just check it you know during and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is it's that sweet Chinese sauce	2304	A
well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
H O I	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
S I N or S E N either way they'll spell it hoi sin sauce it's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown	2304	A
and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork	2304	A
and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper	2304	A
and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry	2304	A
just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce	2304	A
that you can serve over rice	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
um well for two people um American- uh if it's American style i'd buy a half a pound if you know we if you're just serving that but if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish	2304	A
um well with guys pretty healthy appetite i'd probably go a third of a pound and then you know you could	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables	2304	A
just stir that in and you've got a very colorful side another dish	2304	A
um the hoi sin sauce oh a dollar twenty nine a can a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals	2304	A
you know	2304	A
<silence>	2304	A
oh no no no no no it's not it's not expensive at all it's one- it's one of the Chinese cooking basics	2304	A
yeah well listen it was good talking with you	2304	A
hope you enjoy your recipe	2304	A

	2359	A
hi Mary have you gone visiting uh any new restaurants lately	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh i i tend to get stuck in in and i find a place that i like and i stay there um i some of the things i like are atmosphere um	2359	A
food price um but mostly i think you know service and atmosphere are the two things that you know i don't minds paying little bit if if i don't have to wait too long to eat and if the service is good the food is good	2359	A
and i find like the- the places that i'm going to now um	2359	A
because- whenever you find a place that's good other people have already already found the same kind of a place and so sometimes i have to go to this place in uh where i know i have to wait at least fifteen minutes sometimes a half hour	2359	A
and um they have little bar there so we sit there and um sipping- sipping on some mixed drinks before we get to eat	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
wow okay So this	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
oh they must have some good food there	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh i had uh an opportunity to visit visit the Dallas area and uh i went to a some steak houses while i was out there and there was this one place that i visited that was really unique the waitresses were dressed with like little cowgirls	2359	A
 and the i don't remember the name of the place but for a menu all they had was a it was like a wooden block	2359	A
and and um i think for food they had steak and beans and they had three different sizes of steak The cowboy the cowgirl and the	2359	A
i forget the the other one the he-man or something like this and um i i i found it uh to be very good The atmosphere was good it was a lot of fun	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
oh no kidding	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
oh that's too bad see how one one place one person can make a big difference on whether you go back to the place again	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
wow okay	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
yeah oh that's really- that's really too bad i had um one place that i enjoyed going to but my my girlfriend didn't like it and then i had asked her about it and she said um	2359	A
that the reason why she didn't like it was that she felt that the place wasn't cleaned well um they had um younger kids you know wiping the tables down and they weren't very	2359	A
well trained i guess and they didn't do a very neat job in cleaning the tables off and when the waitresses came they she just put all of the clean utensils and everything right on top of these dirty tables	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
	2359	A
yeah right	2359	A
 i- i can certainly understand that in fact in this same restaurant that my girlfriend doesn't like to go to she um frequently finds food	2359	A
struck onto the utensils as where she's got to go through uh three or four uh different um utensils and the the the waitresses are very nice they'll they'll keep exchanging it	2359	A
but they don't look you know like uh she had complained about it one time and the girl said she was sorry she picked up these utensils and and when back and grabbed some new ones and then put the new ones back down and the new ones looked worse than the ones that she took away so she is not even looking you know and	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
yeah	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
that's true	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
yeah	2359	A
	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
oh boy	2359	A
	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
 how about fast food do you enjoy um fast food restaurants	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh yeah yeah i enjoy it once in a while but i enjoy relaxing while i eat you can't really do that in these fast food places	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh at a	2359	A
at a restaurant or at home	2359	A
at home oh yeah	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
we're just beginning with that it um it took one of the pizza companies and i think it was um gee Domino's	2359	A
yeah right after they started i guess the other uh businesses lost money and they all began doing the same thing	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
we have	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
no which one is that	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
yeah we have uh Popaginos- did you ever here of Popaginos	2359	A
okay we have a that's a fairly large chain in New England we have a a Popaginos um and they had not been delivering up until the time where uh Domino's began delivering and within a matter of six months they started up there own delivery service	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
it would seem to me that if that if i owned a business the thing that i would want to do is is a get little survey uh you know like we're doing with each other and and encourage people to to give that information back to the management	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
and then maybe somehow turn what ever negatives around into a positive	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
uh-huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
huh	2359	A
<silence>	2359	A
oh that's too bad it	2359	A
	2359	A
um	2359	A
	2359	B
hi	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
well i haven't been to any new ones but i have uh several that i frequent uh mainly because of specialties in foods	2359	B
and i have so many so many	2359	B
foods that i prefer uh that i enjoy such as oriental foods i don't like Japanese food but i like all Chinese foods	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
ah sounds familiar	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
oh that sounds uh very much like one of our very very best places to get steaks	2359	B
uh and they open at five and if your not there at five thirty you'll probably have about an hour wait	2359	B
and they have a bar also which is always crowded as can be but it's it's an specially fine restaurant and when you consider they take no plastic or checks	2359	B
strictly cash and they've been in business oh for at least forty years uh that's they	2359	B
yes yes it it's their their steaks are exquisite they also have uh excellent uh liver which i happen to like	2359	B
and um those are the two specialties which they have uh that and their stewed tomatoes which are well known all over the Dayton area	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
oh	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
right	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
	2359	B
	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes right well one of the nicer restaurants supposedly that opened up here not uh too very long ago uh called Harbor Lights specializes in fish	2359	B
and uh the atmosphere is fantastic and i was there with it's a group um	2359	B
that uh we were having a going away dinner for a friend and there were twelve of us and i the the food that uh we ordered uh each of us was quite good but the service was horrendous	2359	B
and the the waitress never once came behind me um um on our side of the table she reached across the table she never once asked if we wanted coffee we had to grab onto someone else they didn't	2359	B
refill our water glasses um someone had only eaten a portion of their food and wanted to take it home and asked to have it boxed and she just pitched it out	2359	B
and then when she finally did bring something um to replace that she practically threw it at the person	2359	B
yes and	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
oh absolutely what made me angry was that when there are groups such as ours there were twelve of us they automatically put the tip on the bill	2359	B
and i'll tell you we had some very unhappy people who were so unhappy with the service and resented paying fifteen percent tip when they had such poor service	2359	B
but	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
oh	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes right right	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
oh well it one thing that gets me is when you see them do uh putting out the um the um knives forks and what have you and when they put them down they hold them by the edge that you are going to put in your mouth	2359	B
and that really up sets me when i see that	2359	B
oh	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
ah	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
uh-huh	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes but yeah	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
oh	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
no no and actually you know those are the kind of things that should get taken back to the management	2359	B
um because the the the waitresses have no control over the the way the dishes are and uh cleaned in the kitchen and if they're not cleaned off well when they go through the dishwasher food just doesn't always get washed off and it sticks on there and then when they dry them	2359	B
um if they air dry them or heat dry them it dries it right on and that's terrible	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
 i agree with that but just don't ever get a glass that has lipstick on it oh that is terrible i had that happen only once i don't remember where but it's always	2359	B
one time enough for me to be aware of the situation and i look at every glass that i get	2359	B
yeah i don't mind that um my husband never cared for fast food so we didn't go that often but you know i have no problem with uh going to a McDonald's or a Wendy's or uh	2359	B
or a a Long John Silver's or any of those once in a while not often but once in a while	2359	B
yeah	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
oh yeah	2359	B
that's that's very true now once in a while if there's a good ballgame like there's going to be tonight with Duke and uh um Kansas City	2359	B
uh uh Kansas uh cause see now i would enjoy having a pizza	2359	B
and just sit and watch the game and a have a pizza and a beer that i would enjoy	2359	B
no no at home just have it delivered yeah we we have number of our pizza places deliver and i assume that you have that there also	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
Domino's was the first one to start yes	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes yes	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
uh we have Domino's we have Pizza Hut and then we have a couple of other {smallers}	2359	B
Little Ceasars and Juan's Pizza they're all in the general vicinity where i live and so i can and then yet my most favorite one doesn't deliver	2359	B
uh it's called Marian's Pizza but i think it is local	2359	B
and the	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
no	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
um-hum	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
right yeah that makes a big difference well we have a lot of businesses going out of business	2359	B
uh in this area and i don't know whether it's necessarily uh nationwide	2359	B
but many of the smaller stores grocery stores card shops uh restaurants- smaller restaurants i can't compete with some of the larger ones and they are all going under	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
yes yes absolutely	2359	B
<silence>	2359	B
well i um uh i've been retired from education uh for oh what eight years and i do i have a bunch of had i should say a bunch of little jobs such as a a sales associate um of women's	2359	B
specialty dress shop and um i was a a manager part-time at a card and gift shop as well as teaching in a modeling agency and modeling so	2359	B
the card shop just went out of business we've been there almost a year almost two years but uh and the card- the store was precious everyone liked the store they liked the kinds of cards and what have you but the location was so poor	2359	B
and it was in a uh shopping strip that had a grocery store on one end that took them almost four years to really get that going and that strip filled up	2359	B
but Kathy selected the middle store in the middle strip	2359	B
and there's still no stores on either side and it's been over a year and a half yes and and it's sad because it was a it was a nice store and she was such a lovely young gal to work for i just feel very bad	2359	B
<silence>	2380	A
do you	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
uh-huh	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
sure	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
well i do think that the cases like the uh oh say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil or or the Texaco Pennzoil problem	2380	A
uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved	2380	A
should handle cases like that	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
oh is that right	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
yeah oh boy or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury	2380	A
uh i was only on one jury ever so far in my life and uh it really was a pretty trivial case and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over this	2380	A
case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars i think it was it was	2380	A
really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody's time and money	2380	A
and it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case	2380	A
they would- they had settled while we were deliberating	2380	A
now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case	2380	A
and uh we were split uh ten to two so it was uh a good thing that it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
uh-huh	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
well i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court because it does cost so much money	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
uh-huh	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
sure	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
yeah	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
yeah i was a witness in a case in a criminal case and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded	2380	A
and that the jury was never allowed to hear and they convicted the defendant	2380	A
ah on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies	2380	A
and i knew the people involved both the people who perjured and the people who uh were defendants	2380	A
and yeah i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury	2380	A
that uh were highly relevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant's innocence	2380	A
so uh i do although i'm a lawyer's daughter and i have lawyer's and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that i really	2380	A
think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
uh-huh	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
well and then in a lot of	2380	A
yeah in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case	2380	A
and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime	2380	A
yeah and now it's possible that he didn't commit this one but the likelihood is certainly tilted	2380	A
with a record like that and uh that was one of the things that we're not allowed to was not allowed in the uh trial i went to though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony	2380	A
had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag	2380	A
and he came in	2380	A
and was presented to the court as a fine upstanding young man who had uh been in seminary to become a priest and yeah	2380	A
you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow but i happen to know his background and i know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence	2380	A
and you know it's it's really annoying when the i asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in	2380	A
he said that that was barred uh by the court	2380	A
so	2380	A
we do have some problems and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles and start over	2380	A
and then make a legal system that carefully protects people but uh where	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
yeah	2380	A
yeah that would be helpful	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
sure would	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
um	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
um	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
and you think that would be relevant	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
right	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
uh-huh	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
uh-huh	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
yeah right	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
uh-huh i think so and uh and	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
yeah that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen	2380	A
and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge	2380	A
but particularly the witnesses	2380	A
<silence>	2380	A
or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed it's like a script has been written when people testify they aren't testifying really in their own words	2380	A
yeah i can remember uh	2380	A
friends of daddy	2380	A
	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
well this is kind of ironic because i work in TI's legal department	2380	B
and although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time	2380	B
and uh when was it a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to uh jury duty i i wasn't selected but um	2380	B
for some of our cases in particular we have um uh very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such	2380	B
and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
right	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not	2380	B
yeah and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a jury um	2380	B
	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
um	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
oh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked twice to go down but i didn't get elected on the panel	2380	B
but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom	2380	B
some their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself and	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
but it's a shame that	2380	B
oh it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get	2380	B
scared enough by going to the court and usually it's the scare- it's the scare kind of of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel you could feel that you really have a very strong case	2380	B
and that you're very much right but the jury may or may not see it that way so you get a little anticipate- you know anxious there and go well you know	2380	B
i don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
um	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
oh really	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
oh is that right	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah and it seems a lot of times that uh especially in criminals that that their rights are so protected but what about the rights of you know the rest of society i mean we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law	2380	B
um and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of	2380	B
if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
 yeah	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah	2380	B
yeah	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
um	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
jeez	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
um	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
yeah i'd even go for for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh	2380	B
um lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth	2380	B
	2380	B
	2380	B
yeah you know	2380	B
yeah i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first um studying to be a paralegal and uh	2380	B
uh they barred priors on this uh person and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other	2380	B
and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know and	2380	B
but they never told us why these people were mad at each other and gee you know that's	2380	B
yeah you know because they they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it because there could be accidental kind of things you know	2380	B
but they never told us why these two people hated their themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other there was never any motive	2380	B
given and and i had a tough time with that and and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom	2380	B
at the end of it all i still didn't know i still have a lot of reasonable doubts and i've seen everything presented	2380	B
and you know they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking	2380	B
i don't know that i want to sit on a jury like that and you'd still you know i want ask some questions	2380	B
here	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
uh-huh	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
right	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
right	2380	B
yeah allow them to uh go back and and deliberate and uh you know after uh each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
right	2380	B
<silence>	2380	B
<silence>	2315	B
well we've been thinking about buying a van	2315	B
because it'd be nice to uh pack the kids and the dog in	2315	B
and	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
well i don't know uh a friend of ours let us borrow their full size van last year we took a trip across cross country and it was really nice uh but they are harder to drive because_1 they're so much bigger	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
we got about eighteen miles a gallon	2315	B
yeah it wasn't that bad and uh but they are big and they're kind of hard to drive	2315	B
uh definitely next car we'll get will be a used car because_1 we can't afford a new car they're so expensive	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
is that right	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yes	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
oh yes i've seen them_1	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
that might be i don't know	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yep	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
that's the way to go	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah one thing i like to do is is go to a police auction and get a car because_1 i've heard you can get pretty good deals but you have to be kind of patient because_1 you can't always just go in and get something right away like- like- like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning from like nine till twelve	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
because_1 Dallas is a pretty big area we got i don't know a million people or a million and a half people or something	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
that's true	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
is that right	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
hum	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah but if you can get a good deal you know if you can save five thousand dollars five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah one thing about	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
oh boy	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
huh	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
huh	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
that's a pretty good deal	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
i think the next car we get too might also be one of those uh import kinds because_1 i don't trust American made cars now i don't think they have the quality and that's that's too bad because_1 i mean i have to keep the money in the country but on the other hand with my money i'm spending i want to get something that's worth my money	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
uh-huh	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
is that right	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah that's right	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah that's nice	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
that's nice	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
um-hum	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
uh-huh	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah i knew a guy here had a a Nissan pickup truck and he had like a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and only had to change the oil never had a problem with it	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
	2315	B
yeah my wife's brother had a he lives in California and he had a Honda Accord i think and he had like a hundred fifty thousand miles on it and he sold it and uh never had a problem with it whereas i got a Chevette and	2315	B
it's the car's almost- almost twelve years old and i got seventy one thousand miles on it is all and i've had problems with it just all the time	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
i bet now isn't that isn't that a Swedish car	2315	B
or Norwegian or something	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
well how did you like your Volvo	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
uh-huh	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yes	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
that's that's a pretty good deal	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
i always told my wife that if i had to do it over again i would uh have my own car dealership and used car dealership and uh she'd be be a travel agent	2315	B
that way if i needed another car i just go get it and whenever we wanted to go someplace we just get tickets for a real good discount and take off	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
 yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah it is	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
yeah	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
who can afford twenty thousand	2315	B
<silence>	2315	B
<silence>	2315	A
okay it says what kind of car would you buy next what kind of car would you buy next	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
yeah a lot of people are you going to buy one of those minivans or you going to buy a full size	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
was the gas mileage decent or	2315	A
oh that's not bad	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
well	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
oh i've never i've really never had a new car i mean i'm pretty young so but a lot of people they go out and buy new cars	2315	A
you know i've i've been -employed for ten years so i- i have enough money to go out and buy a new one	2315	A
but instead i go out and buy toys and things oh um but	2315	A
see my situation's really different because i always had an older brother that always worked on cars and he got into business and he only worked on one kind of car	2315	A
yeah and what happened is he his he had a business and they and they bought a lot of cars a lot of the same kind of cars what ended up he he eventually had his own private junkyard which is	2315	A
terrible to look at very illegal but it was very cheap for us to run our cars because pretty much everyone in the family and there's seven of us kids	2315	A
would have one i mean me and my husband have the same kind of car my brother and his wife drive the same kind of car my sister has the same kind of car and my father has the same kind so it's you know when we get together and go places	2315	A
and we meet places it's like gee you guys don't like one kind of car do you	2315	A
it's a very strange car i don't know you- if you have them down there but it's a Saab	2315	A
yeah they're not that popular down south i don't	2315	A
i maybe it's something to do with the front wheel drive and they're supposed to be good in snow but they're very popular up here in Vermont and a lot of people used to bring his car their cars	2315	A
to him to get them fixed because he was he was really good at it and uh he didn't charge as much as the dealer so and he also was really nice to people and	2315	A
he'd help them out a lot if they were broke down he'd try to go fix their car on the road instead of calling the tow truck so that saved them a lot of money	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
yeah i've heard that that's a really good way to get cars up here they- they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don't um	2315	A
they don't repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repossess- they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it	2315	A
	2315	A
can imagine you have a good you have a you could have a good uh choice of cars but then of course there's more people interested in them too	2315	A
huh i don't know but i know someone who goes to Massachusetts and buys cars that have been wrecked or uh salvaged they probably- they might have been stolen and	2315	A
the insurance company buys them and they sell them_1 and i've known people who have got really nice late model cars very cheap but but they have a dubious background they have salvage stamped on their title there's	2315	A
there one of my friends got one that the the whole underneath the car the frame was twisted	2315	A
and they didn't really know it it was a real nice late model car real pretty on the outside but they couldn't keep tires on it it kept eating the tires	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
yep	2315	A
i know a lot of people who've bought other cars the same way and and have done very well	2315	A
i mean i the my car that i drive came out of um a salvage yard but i see- see it wasn't um	2315	A
wasn't in an accident it had burned the whole inside of it burned the wire and cable burned and of course my brother being the clever person he was had an identical car but it had been in an accident	2315	A
so we took the wiring harness out and the engine and the transmission and everything else and we put it into the the	2315	A
the shell that was burned we had the shell all sandblasted and painted and he he pretty much built me a car so	2315	A
yeah i was i was pretty happy i got what i pretty much wanted i could have had it any color i wanted	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
that's true but you know i always thought American cars weren't any good but i uh rented a car i rented a Ford Taurus and i was impressed i really liked it	2315	A
yeah and uh i was talking to my older sister the other day and uh she said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big enough she's got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot	2315	A
and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon she says they're not very pretty but like she was really impressed but i liked them a lot because	2315	A
they resembled the Saab when i got inside the door was big you know it wasn't it wasn't like a Volkswagen Rabbit you know i- i mean it had a full size door handle on it and it was the interior	2315	A
was very plush and padded it it was just i liked the car a lot and when you shut the door it made a real solid sound	2315	A
and the performance it you know it it you could make it do anything on the interstate you wanted	2315	A
so i was really impressed if i if i didn't have- have if i didn't buy uh used Saabs	2315	A
you know if i didn't have a father and a brother that help me out i would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus as opposed to a Volkswagen Rabbit or a Toyota	2315	A
but that's one thing about	2315	A
cars my husband wants a Toyota pickup truck and i can't talk him into a Dodge pickup truck or a Chevy pickup he wants a Toyota pickup truck and they are they're very popular and i guess they run	2315	A
they they you they just keep running and running and running they have a really good track record	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
yeah i know this this this person they go they have this old Toyota truck and he goes yep i say you know this thing's been running for me for two years he goes boy i wish i had the money to treat it right i'm like what do you mean	2315	A
he says i haven't tuned it up in two years and i change the oil about every four months because_1 he can't afford to um change the oil as often as as he would like and he can't afford to tune it up	2315	A
so it it's amazing even when you abuse them	2315	A
	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
all the time	2315	A
well i- i have problems with my car i'm not saying it's not perfect or anything but i wouldn't trade my Saab for anything i	2315	A
yeah	2315	A
it it's a Swedish car i'm just being stupid and sentimental it's just because it's about the only kind of car i've ever had i had a Volvo once	2315	A
you know it's like if i had to go out if i	2315	A
to buy a truck i could i could go out and easily buy a truck but i'd have a hard time going out and buying another car if it wasn't a Saab i don't know	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
um it was it was fine but it was an old one and um	2315	A
it was pretty much it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old Volvo	2315	A
and at that time i was going to college and i liked to go camping and {bajaing} and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it	2315	A
and i saved some money by buying a junkier Saab that i could beat around	2315	A
so it it worked out pretty well	2315	A
i've never had problems really getting getting cars it's it's refusing them	2315	A
because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them_1 because they know that they deal and sell them_1 yes my father's very shrewd with them	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
	2315	A
<silence>	2315	A
 yeah that's a good way to do it um the thing about it is you got to you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic if you want to be involved and that's a hard job	2315	A
well i you know i always	2315	A
dream of buying a new car but	2315	A
yeah i don't it just the money just isn't worth that that shininess	2315	A
yes they're very expensive i mean even-	2315	A
hi	2344	A
my name's Ken	2344	A
and um	2344	A
you're in Texas right	2344	A
everybody's in Texas God okay	2344	A
i'm in Rochester New York everybody else but one has been in Texas	2344	A
okay well i guess we should get on with this um did you get the message about what it was right yeah okay go great let me just hit the button	2344	A
	2344	A
okay um do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yeah that's interesting i don't i- i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore	2344	A
i suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein	2344	A
who's our biggest threat but um i wonder if they're i wonder how much of a threat they are i agree with you that that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there's just	2344	A
it's just so big and there's just so much military machine there	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
right	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them	2344	A
huh	2344	A
that's	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yeah uh	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yeah oh i agree i mean if we were to if if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of	2344	A
for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be but	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yeah actually i noticed that i mean this- this- this this most recent scam of his where he said	2344	A
where where he just decided that instead of having uh	2344	A
instead of having	2344	A
i can't- i can't think of the word now um	2344	A
if they're having demonstrations for in in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well i'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether	2344	A
so i- i- i think that he he he's actually he i think is becoming very dangerous	2344	A
because he's making those people angry at him and he's also i think he's also making	2344	A
um the military angry at him i mean i've heard stories now where the	2344	A
where the um the military is running around and they're sort of getting restless	2344	A
and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know with with the Baltic States when they just go in there	2344	A
to beat people up	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
that's interesting	2344	A
i- i wonder i don't know if he's he he seems	2344	A
the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb i don't know though	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
that's that that's that's something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think that's that's certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just Gorbachev said you can't do it and we're just not going to let you do it you know so	2344	A
yeah that that's real scary actually i mean i- i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but	2344	A
it could be real dangerous	2344	A
yeah right we don't need to worry about them	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yes but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yes	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
well i don't i don't know i think that underlying- underlying- underlying we're all pretty	2344	A
probably not as as different as everybody thinks	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
right well that's that's certainly true i just	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
that's true i was i was discussing with someone before um this uh someone before actually one of these calls	2344	A
as a matter of fact about um	2344	A
another topic but it came up under these um	2344	A
this this this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something	2344	A
you've read that one before	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to	2344	A
the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and and in kindergarten we learned to share	2344	A
and we learned to um play with each other we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other	2344	A
you know and and that would be all and if we could just do the same thing	2344	A
sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we'd we'd be fine	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yeah unfortunately	2344	A
because_1 because i often i often sort of wonder how	2344	A
having never been to the Soviet Union um how different the people there really are you know how- how much- everyone always thought of them as you know sort of the	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
 yeah	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
right	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
i would i would love to go there i mean like again- again not now but at some point to go see what what i mean what this is like i mean this this is amazing because_1 this is	2344	A
this is an an i mean this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us like you said before as well so it'd be interesting to watch	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yeah that's that's and and the ones they even feel	2344	A
somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the Baltic States	2344	A
where they don't have a strong leader that you know at least at least Russia has some sort of strong leader i mean they have Yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help Russia	2344	A
but um i mean the Baltic States i think are just sort of trapped i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago	2344	A
and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country and	2344	A
you be this way	2344	A
uh i- i think it's a sad state of affairs but	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
oh yeah the yeah	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
right	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
yeah well that yeah and that	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
um um actually it sounds very i mean very similar they're sort of being they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece	2344	A
and they have other problems they have Shiite Muslims to deal with	2344	A
as well as Saddam Hussein i- i mean i think their big problem up there is that they you know is unfortunately not only are they	2344	A
there- there's more than one group fighting for the same place where they all want you know whereas the Baltics are saying well we want our own we just want this little tiny piece of land	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
yes yes	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
um-hum um actually uh my wife is Syrian	2344	A
um so i- i also i know some of the history and so forth	2344	A
and and the actually the real funny thing is that i'm i'm i'm Jewish we're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves	2344	A
so we i- i know that and i've been to Israel and i know and i sort of toured the area and i know that it really is very	2344	A
lots of different cultures in one place i mean and and it's the same thing i it's it's almost the same thing out out in the Soviet Union right now there you know there are	2344	A
you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them_1 together forcibly	2344	A
i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here but they wanted to do it	2344	A
so i could put the	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
that's that's certainly true	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
right um	2344	A
i wonder i wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that so at least	2344	A
<silence>	2344	A
that's possible-	2344	A
hello hi	2344	B
hi Ken my name's Diane	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yes i'm in San Antonio	2344	B
	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
oh	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
okay	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yes	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
i think they'll always represent a threat whether-	2344	B
whether or not there's an active cold war or not	2344	B
uh it's it's a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities	2344	B
and	2344	B
uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
probably not no	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
right	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
um-hum and it's and it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them and and the great powers are always pitted against each other	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
i don't know they they're going downhill pretty steady	2344	B
but i- i agree right now they're not i don't believe they're a large threat right now i think there's always some threat	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
actually i feel kind of sorry for them_1 right now because the people are are are uh wanting	2344	B
things that we have that they're not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
see i'm concerned that that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his	2344	B
own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square and uh it's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
i don't know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah we've got our own worries at the moment so	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
i guess as long as as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
well sure that but that's a that's an impossibility i think	2344	B
given the the uh the differences in the world and people are just too different	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
but unfortunately people people aren't that insightful	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
they just see that	2344	B
this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do so therefore he's wrong and he's bad and we have to wipe wipe him out	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
uh-huh	2344	B
no i haven't read it i've heard all about it though	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yes but people grow up and they forget	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
that's one of the places i would most like to go not right now of course but at at some point i would like to to go to Moscow and and	2344	B
to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information i mean we didn't know	2344	B
what things were like	2344	B
so	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah i and i the the people i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't	2344	B
 they- i mean they they can't do any they can't change it they try and they	2344	B
there's nothing that they can do	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
it's it's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the	2344	B
i'm trying to think of the name of the the something like that in Northern Iraq	2344	B
who are actually who are actually countrymen of of i mean some of them were split off into Israel i believe and some of them are in Turkey when actually	2344	B
they they don't they're their own people and their own beliefs and their own culture system and they were split up into three different countries	2344	B
and and they're very dissatisfied and they're they're causing wars right now and	2344	B
and i don't think it's that different from what the Baltic States are are going through	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
uh-huh	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
the the one that i think	2344	B
one of the women- women that i work for is married to an Iranian and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the the countries over there and within five or six countries there are	2344	B
	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
oh	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
oh huh uh-huh	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
yeah and i- and i don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different i really don't	2344	B
i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs	2344	B
<silence>	2344	B
they they they might the the Baltic States might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here	2344	B
to to escape-	2344	B
<silence>	2327	B
um	2327	B
i don't think that i'm paying too many tax you know too much tax myself	2327	B
uh i uh as far as uh you know federal and state uh the uh the state i live in has a five percent sales tax	2327	B
uh it's quite a bit different than uh Texas i don't know if you've ever been outside of Texas but uh	2327	B
when i moved to Texas i was told oh well there's no personal income tax well they nail you on property taxes in uh Texas and then that's how they get their money to take care of the schools and things	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah i- i found it interesting uh when i moved to Texas the fact that uh the reason people wanted to get their kids into Plano was to go to the Plano school district because_1 it was the best because it had more money than you know other places	2327	B
and uh i just um	2327	B
in the uh like here in Maryland uh i just bought a uh a house for a hundred and forty one thousand it'd be about sixty thousand down there and um	2327	B
the tax basis is actually uh less than the full price of the house	2327	B
so you end up paying property taxes on what they value the house at i think they only have the house valued at probably about	2327	B
 ninety or a hundred thousand dollars	2327	B
whereas when i was in Texas i notice that they put the tax basis at at almost the uh full price	2327	B
and so there was quite a difference there	2327	B
um i think that the way they they levy taxes is a little bit uh	2327	B
crazy i think if if they uh people and and i'll use Plano as an example uh house prices in Plano were falling	2327	B
and so they decided well in order to get more tax revenue we're going to have to raise the price uh you know we're going to have to raise the uh the the uh tax per hundred dollars of value on the house	2327	B
and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes	2327	B
then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people weren't buying the existing family homes so	2327	B
they were shooting themselves in the foot	2327	B
and you know if they just would have thought well gee if we don't you know if we put a freeze on new home starts	2327	B
that will bring the price of houses back up our tax base revenue will go up and we won't have to increase taxes and make it more of a burden on people that are living here	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
no no they do have state income tax	2327	B
yeah that's and they uh they divide it up by um you know you pay a state income tax and then fifty percent of your state income tax is a county tax which is collected by the state and redistributed to the counties	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
that is correct	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
um yes i did i only lived in Texas in eighty seven and um eighty eight and uh part of eighty nine	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
no	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
um	2327	B
in Texas i was oh i believe the uh tax- sales tax was somewhere around seven eight eight percent	2327	B
here in Maryland it's only five um it was nice to have that uh you know deduction when it was available	2327	B
uh but when they revamped the you know supposedly making things more fair um	2327	B
i've heard a lot of different arguments uh pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales tax or even uh	2327	B
maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when you think about it the people that purchase more items are the ones that are better able to pay the taxes	2327	B
you know people that are out there barely struggling to pay their uh house payment and buy food aren't going to be out buying you know anything else	2327	B
and the the people that you know have the uh disposable income that are	2327	B
probably more able to pay the income tax	2327	B
uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and they're out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um	2327	B
there was- there's another crazy thing that gets me it's like the more children you have the less tax you pay	2327	B
and to me that is completely crazy and i have five children so i mean you know i uh i you know it it's kind of odd when i talk about this with other people because it it just doesn't make sense to me you're getting more services	2327	B
you know your children are going you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
um-hum	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah now the other side of the question is about are we getting what we're paying for um	2327	B
for the most part i think we are but there is a lot of inefficiency uh both on the federal level and on the state level	2327	B
and uh hopefully we'll	2327	B
you know as we start to go into computerization and all the processes maybe we'll be able to streamline it	2327	B
um i haven't kept up with uh the Texas politics other than that dirty little uh governor fight	2327	B
but i mean uh we have a a governor here in Maryland who's uh pretty hard nosed and uh he's you know we're three hundred fifty million dollars short	2327	B
and every time he comes up with a plan to cut the money everybody starts screaming and yelling	2327	B
and uh every time he wants to cut one budget or do something else or try to do something you know they start screaming yelling they won't let him raise the taxes and and they they won't let him cut any programs and he's like what do you guys want me to do	2327	B
	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
um-hum	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yes	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah that and i think uh putting more emphasis on local handling of the problem i think this is something that that Bush came out and said in his uh in his address uh to the nation at the beginning of the year	2327	B
um you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own	2327	B
and that you know the states would take care of the communities and then all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government	2327	B
and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know there's a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way	2327	B
and uh maintenance and overhead and you know and and those kind of costs	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
um-hum	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah	2327	B
<silence>	2327	B
yeah there there's uh you know once you reach a certain plateau in in finances um	2327	B
	2327	A
okay what is your uh general opinion then of of taxes for the Americans	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
um-hum	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right yeah uh	2327	A
as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not	2327	A
they're not equitable within the state so they're changing that they're talking about changing the uh the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools which will probably mean uh another increase in property taxes	2327	A
either that or uh starting a state income tax	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
uh-huh	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
almost full value right yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
um-hum	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah guess that's a possibility	2327	A
uh as i understand it Maryland does not have any uh state income tax is that right	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
oh okay so	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
okay then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes	2327	A
okay did you live in Texas after the uh after they stopped letting you deduct uh sales tax on your tax return	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
okay so so you couldn't deduct state income- uh state sales tax when you lived in Texas	2327	A
so what do you think about the difference between those two situations	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
um-hum	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
um-hum	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah that's that's an interesting uh interesting concept i hadn't thought about that how you you you know that that's right i guess in a sense	2327	A
i guess the you know the idea is that uh the more people you have in the family the more allowances you need you know the more uh capability you need to uh to	2327	A
pay for food and clothing and stuff for them so the they give you more allowances more dependent allowances for that	2327	A
but uh you know i understand what you're where you're coming from with the	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
um-hum	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
	2327	A
yeah that's i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh is we're we're talking about having uh national uh military or or public service deal for young people	2327	A
maybe a program like that could replace some of the uh welfare programs	2327	A
if uh you know if we're going to do that then we ought to really get some benefit dollar benefits out of it that uh to reduce spending in some other areas uh	2327	A
you know to do something to eliminate what uh what they refer to as transfer payments	2327	A
because uh that's i think that's where our real you know the real problem with government is not is not what the not what the government's doing but where it's spending its money it's it's encouraging people to	2327	A
to uh	2327	A
not do as well as they can you know uh not have as much output and	2327	A
all that you're paying people not to work and you're paying people to have more kids and you know like you said you know more kids you have the more dependents you have you know the allowances you get	2327	A
and uh	2327	A
the more you have the more uh aid for dependent children you can get and all of these things go into it so	2327	A
but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right it uh	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
right	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
yeah right i- i think that a a big part of the uh you know the government concept over the last fifty years has been uh redistribution of uh of wealth in in effect	2327	A
uh you know you you tax the people that have the most and the people that don't have anything get it for nothing	2327	A
and uh and i don't think that's the American way myself it uh	2327	A
it kind of rings of you know socialism and	2327	A
and i just i don't understand why	2327	A
the American leaders uh seem to think that that's the way to go you know that	2327	A
uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for	2327	A
or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to	2327	A
<silence>	2327	A
	2395	A
where do you get most of your news	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
where where are you oh yeah	2395	A
no i'm in San Antonio	2395	A
um-hum i get my news from a combination of sources i take the the paper everyday and i read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool uh-huh and uh	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
and i watch the uh actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work and then you know usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
oh yeah	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
yeah um one of the women that i work with her husband is Iranian	2395	A
so here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
well i i uh i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
i understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
yeah	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
i've been getting a kick out of those lately	2395	A
although um	2395	A
i'm i'm only twenty five so i've never actually been through a period of war and i don't know anyone in the military and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh	2395	A
military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff and i thought the generals were very interesting now when they started to speculate i	2395	A
i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on but i thought they were they- they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
you know one of the the best uh television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on ABC and it was for children and it was hosted by Peter Jennings	2395	A
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions	2395	A
and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in Saudi Arabia and Israel and and all they had them all uh	2395	A
on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very	2395	A
informative and interesting and uh i was real impressed at how ABC handled uh	2395	A
translating the war for children	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
and our local HEB stores here i don't know if it's HEB statewide or whatever but they have videos	2395	A
that uh i don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
uh it was it was	2395	A
right it was something for children	2395	A
that that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
well	2395	A
back during the Vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh	2395	A
the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal	2395	A
so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly	2395	A
covered by the news	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
yeah i tell you what the first three days i was glued to the television	2395	A
and i had	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
yeah	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
i tell you what the the uh war started- let's see was it a Wednesday or Thursday must have been Thursday	2395	A
um and Friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open	2395	A
because i was watching CNN and they would they would switch back to the one of their Israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just i was amazed	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
oh	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
uh-huh	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
no there are two and they're pretty close	2395	A
uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper i grew up near Houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck	2395	A
and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff i mean it's- it's	2395	A
{piddley} stuff to pick a newspaper over and i enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper like this newspaper has The Far Side and some other comics that i enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of so	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
yeah	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
and my fiancee-	2395	A
<silence>	2395	A
my fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers He takes both San Antonio papers an Austin paper both Houston papers i guess he takes seven the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper	2395	A
but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University so he's getting all the sports sections	2395	A
and so you know he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread unless	2395	A
	2395	B
i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
i'm in Dallas	2395	B
are you in Dallas also	2395	B
oh really okay	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
oh really	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i normally find that uh i- i'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends so i don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch	2395	B
i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week	2395	B
but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning	2395	B
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work um the MacNeil Lehrer news hour is on uh public television and i enjoy that quite a bit	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
i will admit i work with uh someone who's Iranian	2395	B
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news he's very very skeptical of the news media and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also	2395	B
but he's i don't know uh he's	2395	B
much- much much more so it's it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the Gulf goings on um	2395	B
he was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself and i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
true um the	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
they um tend to spend	2395	B
quite a bit of time on one story they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like the uh what is that ABC's Nightline	2395	B
uh well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story but they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
no no it's very much national interest news a lot of times they end up um	2395	B
with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that i i don't know the value of that because um i saw plenty of jokes and and um	2395	B
oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making their living during the the Gulf War	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
i will admit it's interesting i i i'm twenty six so i don't have any more experience in that than you um	2395	B
it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it and they seemed to mold the events	2395	B
to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
yeah i i didn't see anything like that although i did uh i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting this is getting a little off the topic but	2395	B
there there is a a big push you know- with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with um counselors	2395	B
to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children i thought that was a really unusual thing	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
it- it with the children's aspect um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i suppose that is a valuable service that again not having uh lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was	2395	B
a a new concern with people	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
that's true that's true	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people's interest didn't {flauge} too badly	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
i will admit the same thing i would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was	2395	B
horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i i didn't have that experience i i don't have cable so i i'm pretty much limited to PBS which i thought i thought they did a very good job	2395	B
um i've got one question for you i	2395	B
you say you take the newspaper	2395	B
um	2395	B
i i found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting we've got	2395	B
the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the Times Herald and then the Morning News which has a very strong subscription	2395	B
does San Antonio have- you said San Antonio right	2395	B
 do you have just one paper or do you have several	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends i figure i'm only taking on the weekend and i can afford that i i find the news reporting in the the	2395	B
Mourning News to be better but i i sort of have a liberal political slant and the Mourning News just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook	2395	B
still i i get the Times Herald just to balance that out a little bit	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
<silence>	2395	B
<silence>	2362	A
i i assume- i assume you have kids	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
oh well she she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
ah	2362	A
well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation i was a substitute teacher for about a year	2362	A
yeah i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it	2362	A
and they uh	2362	A
in Alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree	2362	A
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong	2362	A
	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um	2362	A
um yeah	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
hum hum	2362	A
	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
well i i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up i maybe should have taken the higher grades because_1 at least you can	2362	A
if you have to you can get mean with them	2362	A
those little kids don't understand it	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
well that's a nice way of putting it	2362	A
	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
exactly- exactly	2362	A
and two most people don't have that option	2362	A
you know and plus it also depends on the district you're in as i mean on the i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do	2362	A
uh accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public	2362	A
i don't know back when i was going to school uh you just didn't get away with things these kids get away with now	2362	A
i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and	2362	A
usually bending over to get five of the best	2362	A
um but now nowadays they can't even they can barely scold the children for something you- you know without getting sued	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
oh yeah	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class	2362	A
and uh	2362	A
this kid comes to school with his lunch box	2362	A
and inside this lunch box he's got	2362	A
easily two i'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
and i asked him uh what are you doing with that	2362	A
he says my father gave it to me	2362	A
and i didn't believe it for a minute	2362	A
um	2362	A
so uh but uh you know the not a lot i could do about it	2362	A
can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
well i have i i've fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing	2362	A
he was a uh	2362	A
well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
but not a lot i could do about it	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah because_1 uh that just that doesn't do a lot for them_1 i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
uh i don't know guns and	2362	A
	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
i don't know that's something	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
oh yeah	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
oh sure i mean it's- it's- it's indicative across the board that we we've done something wrong	2362	A
and when you see uh Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs	2362	A
and you know here we are we can't we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um	2362	A
i don't know	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
no	2362	A
	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah that's that's a great deal what law school's like	2362	A
 yeah	2362	A
um yeah	2362	A
and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester	2362	A
and it's how well you can remember it all	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah and i found that a particularly useless way of studying	2362	A
um	2362	A
i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize	2362	A
and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories	2362	A
but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned	2362	A
so uh it didn't show me anything a year and a half i gave it up	2362	A
i wasn't really want i didn't want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
so	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
well i don't know what can we do about it	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
	2362	A
money money is not the answer	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah i mean they're- they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
well i don't know i uh as much as i didn't like school when i was going through it	2362	A
from my perspective now i can see that it's a lot better	2362	A
than what we have now	2362	A
and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school	2362	A
you know i mean it's- it's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
yeah exactly i mean i	2362	A
i- i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something	2362	A
to students because they're going get they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something	2362	A
oh yeah	2362	A
	2362	A
well lawyers help create that	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
	2362	A
well i think i think i i mean what we've turned the schools into now are just day care centers	2362	A
you know somebody okay we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he's out of our hair	2362	A
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents	2362	A
you know they just	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
oh sure i mean- mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything- anything at home then it's it's not going to help either	2362	A
so i i don't know i don't know what the i don't know what the answer is	2362	A
it's an interesting interesting thing you want to do i how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
<silence>	2362	A
hum	2362	A
	2362	A
that's interesting i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when some people first tried that and they got sued	2362	A
got taken to court by the school system	2362	A
i'm glad the parents won i mean that's	2362	A
	2362	A
and then uh	2362	A
<silence>	2362	B
uh we have one she's only nine months old	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
right well my degree is in teaching so	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
so i	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
oh really	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
 did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
 well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but i taught junior high	2362	B
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn't that bad i taught remedial reading kids	2362	B
and well they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but but anyway at the time that's what i taught and um	2362	B
you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way	2362	B
when you have your slow readers but it it wasn't too bad we we got along real well	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah i especially with the real young ones i started out wanting to teach elementary- lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and	2362	B
got up until about the sixth grade and so that's what i got my certification in	2362	B
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools	2362	B
um and my reason for that was i don't like	2362	B
the	2362	B
uh what's the right word the varied	2362	B
inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
	2362	B
you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard	2362	B
but i don't think they could cover everything that you could	2362	B
teach your children on an individual basis	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
right	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
right	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
crazy for him to but	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
well we had the problem when i was in with teaching um i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them_1 taken out of the schools	2362	B
or trying to teach them something while they were there	2362	B
and you don't know if you were reaching them_1 or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them_1 was better- trying to teach them was better than have them_1 taken out	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
	2362	B
um i don't know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on but	2362	B
it ended up better	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
but	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
i think there's a problem too with teachers trying to um	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know they've been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics	2362	B
and uh and i'm not	2362	B
completely just you know just teach the basics in schools but i think there does- does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our our lowering grades in the standardized test and such	2362	B
but	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
right	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
well i spent a year and a half in Japan also and i've seen how their school system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything	2362	B
and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades going to be	2362	B
so i don't completely agree with that either	2362	B
	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
oh is it	2362	B
is that what you ended up going into	2362	B
oh	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
how how much you can stuff in your brain	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
well	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
good- good question	2362	B
probably taking	2362	B
no there's plenty of money in the system it's just	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
i think it's uh like a lot of things in the in the the United States we've got so much built up in um	2362	B
in the state- in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that that can be done	2362	B
not without wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system and so	2362	B
maybe on smaller smaller scales	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum right into the classroom it needs to be	2362	B
be able to be enforced	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
it's like doctors in lawsuits you know they're kind of fearful of everything	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
 that's that's true i've well at least i've heard that i i i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's been applicable to me but	2362	B
but	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
right	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
right	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to to prove that you're teaching them something you have to follow	2362	B
a preferred curriculum um well they try to encourage you to to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to	2362	B
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be	2362	B
they're kind of monitored	2362	B
you know they they will allow you to i can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of Mennonites or something like that i don't think they're is in in this area but	2362	B
um they they are monitored by the uh	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
by the	2362	B
state school board	2362	B
so	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
<silence>	2362	B
	2330	A
there we go	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
 i think that's true	2330	A
the uh the Bermuda grass is greening up	2330	A
uh in in March it sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April so	2330	A
so i think we're a little -ahead uh ahead of schedule on that	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
that's true it's been a a fun break but it the break is over	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
well yeah but i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend so	2330	A
yeah	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
yeah	2330	A
 i hadn't heard whether it's gonna rain or not	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
well that's good	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
yeah that's probably a a little bit under what it is for this time of year i- i think i haven't seen the weather- the news- the weather	2330	A
on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
yeah	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
yeah that's true	2330	A
um	2330	A
 one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high	2330	A
of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high	2330	A
and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable	2330	A
that it doesn't vary very much	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
yeah- i mean any other time of year that's not the case because_1 it could be very warm or very cold	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
uh-huh	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
right	2330	A
right	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
yeah one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year	2330	A
 was a twenty six degree lightning storm	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
 i you know i was going into the grocery store and a a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out	2330	A
and i thought well gee i've i've never known it to lightning at that temperature	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
that's right it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high	2330	A
sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that	2330	A
twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing	2330	A
the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees	2330	A
because_1 the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
nope	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
 yep i i'm really enjoying this now	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
 well this has been interesting	2330	A
not- not too challenging to the brain	2330	A
<silence>	2330	A
nope	2330	A
 all right Ellen well you have a good day	2330	A
bye-bye	2330	A
	2330	A
yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yeah	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yeah i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and i noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
 yeah well um oh i guess another thing i've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days it's been awfully gray you know just	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yeah	2330	B
but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it's gray	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
oh i go for that yeah	2330	B
in fact i'm a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like it's gonna be a little bit on the cool side	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
 i think there's an eighty percent chance this evening but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest'll be	2330	B
without rain	2330	B
 but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties	2330	B
that's getting back to a little bit chillier	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yeah i'm not certain either but you're probably right	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
 well i like it when it's sort of a a medium temperature uh maybe seventy five to eighty somewhere in there i- i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm	2330	B
i'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
hm	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yeah you're probably right	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yes as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on TV and i think it was one day this week a year ago	2330	B
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
oh wow	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
hm	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yeah that that is pretty unusual	2330	B
and you really take notice of it too uh	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
hm	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
wow	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
yeah i don't don't like that super cold stuff	2330	B
	2330	B
<silence>	2330	B
 yeah well	2330	B
 not not a real in depth topic but enjoyed talking to you	2330	B
okay- okay good-bye	2330	B
	2330	B
	2303	B
all right we need to discuss the voters	2303	B
on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
oh i think so too and i think the other thing is the news media- media puts such a blitz on it that they've uh they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference	2303	B
due to the overabundance of news we have available to us	2303	B
what do you think on the local elections though	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
oh i think so too absolutely uh i think another thing	2303	B
and uh i'm making a judgment here that may or may i think it is totally wrong well	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
i think that the people that are um- have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education	2303	B
 tend not to be registered	2303	B
and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would	2303	B
and i believe in this but	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind i had someone tell me that	2303	B
i will never register to vote because i don't serve on a jury	2303	B
	2303	B
	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
so they were if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
there is convoluted logic for you	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
 yes	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
 oh i just right right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didn't have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
that's a good point you're probably right	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
which	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout	2303	B
a massive turnout at last someone wants us to vote they were standing in lines to vote	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
and their vote didn't count	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
or any one shows up	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
total indifference you know what difference does it make back gone the full circle	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
oh certainly there's a message there even if they lose	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too	2303	B
yeah- yeah i think- well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here	2303	B
you know	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
oh okay	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
 was was that the time no that was later- eighty four that's too soon she said something about uh	2303	B
Ginger Rogers did- did everything Fred	2303	B
Astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
 she said that i didn't said you know don't tell me what women can do	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
well and some of the issues are so emotional	2303	B
you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
i	2303	B
everyone has made so many statements i don't live in Dallas county	2303	B
but	2303	B
i've heard so many statements that i've lost track	2303	B
i honestly at this point	2303	B
it's it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone you really even the news you cannot follow	2303	B
what the story- the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided	2303	B
i wonder about them at some point	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
that's correct	2303	B
and that's another- and that's another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed	2303	B
are they politicians	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
sure	2303	B
or you want to take the other side of it you can argue that's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because	2303	B
it's it's difficult	2303	B
it's situational really	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
uh	2303	B
uh	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
oh	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
hum	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
well this is true this is true i was worrying uh along the lines of you get everytime someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box	2303	B
a dollar bill comes out the bottom	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
that might work in some places	2303	B
<silence>	2303	B
	2303	B
<silence>	2303	A
yes	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
i i	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if	2303	A
um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting	2303	A
	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so	2303	A
i think- i i think that's a big uh a big a big reason for it how about_1	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um that's true actually i never thought about that that that's a good reason-	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
that's true that's true	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um-hum that	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because	2303	A
they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect- if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know	2303	A
um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don't have	2303	A
um that that it doesn't- doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true	2303	A
i think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
uh	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
right	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
right but	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well	2303	A
i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway	2303	A
you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represented- i i i would guess	2303	A
that that- that portion of the population is massively under represented and	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
hum what do they have to do with one another	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
oh so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
oh i didn't realize that actually that	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
yeah there is there there there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty	2303	A
just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
well that that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like responsibilities- responsibilities	2303	A
no i think	2303	A
i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to say- you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i	2303	A
put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty and and they don't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
yes	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
yes they were they were doing that unfortunately what what they were they had they had no idea what they were voting on	2303	A
it turns out	2303	A
that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them_1 are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
right that that's true	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
right	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
now if things go the way that that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of	2303	A
only half of them_1 will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so	2303	A
you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when	2303	A
when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesn't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
i think that	2303	A
yeah i think and i i think that's real important	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
that's probably true	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
yeah	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
hum that's good that's that's- that's- that's actually real good	2303	A
i said well well actually- actually- the the female who i would most rally behind right now right i don't know much about her politics that's about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is Ann Richards	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
i don't know her politics i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four Democratic uh convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
 that's very good	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
that that's that's that's very good that's i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think inflammatory- inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think	2303	A
i would hope	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
no oh i've heard of it but not necessarily i've heard it's very controversial though	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
hum	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
yes	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
that's what	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
hum hum hum well they're elected as well so	2303	A
	2303	A
 so	2303	A
so they're going to be	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
but	2303	A
that's- that's true that's true well	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge	2303	A
but on the other hand	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
right	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
that's right	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
so how do you think we can get people to vote	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
i've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think it- but- but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win	2303	A
to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else	2303	A
 so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um	2303	A
anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person	2303	A
but i suspect that that that would actually never work	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
 that's an interesting notion	2303	A
<silence>	2303	A
that that that that that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah	2303	A
	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
uh	2329	A
i've only purchased one new car in my entire life	2329	A
right	2329	A
and that was back in nineteen fifty nine	2329	A
and it was a new Ford	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so the automobiles that that i have uh	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
first of all we have a source now we got a a friend whose a nun	2329	A
and we've been purchasing her cars she buys a brand new car every three or four years	2329	A
and then when she gets ready to trade it in she offers it to us and we buy it	2329	A
so	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah and uh we've got we've got a sixty seven Mustang that we bought brand new	2329	A
and we still have that	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so yeah it's going to be uh let's see next year i guess it will be an antique	2329	A
yeah	2329	A
but the problem with it is up here around there's so much salt on the roads	2329	A
that it's hard to keep automobiles for any length of time because they all rust out and	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah uh every once in a while though uh i'll read a blip where you guys get some	2329	A
uh terrible ice storms	2329	A
but they don't put salt on the roads down there then	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
ugh okay	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
nobody nobody goes anywhere no one will	2329	A
	2329	A
okay so how about how about you how about purchasing an automobile	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
oh okay	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah so what do you buy what are you looking for you look for an automatic you know you look for something with all the	2329	A
you can't drive a standard	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah no i used to when i was when i was uh younger	2329	A
you know but i've it's been long gone out of my system now i could just put it in home and let it go there and take me there and that's it i don't like any of that	2329	A
but i do like comfort i like uh uh we have bigger automobiles now we've got Pontiacs	2329	A
uh i like the comfort you know and and the mileage we get is depending on if it's tuned up or not we get between eighteen and twenty two miles to the gallon uh	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
you know it's not really all that that doesn't it's it isn't as good as some of the smaller ones you know that they get a zillion miles	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
uh	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah that's i i had a pickup truck in fact i had i had two the last one i gave to my uh uh youngest	2329	A
uh	2329	A
because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove	2329	A
so and i like the i like the warmth and the comfort of it so	2329	A
every winter well- i used to go out and chop wood and get it all ready for the next season so a pickup truck was handy for the work i was doing around	2329	A
but now everything's done so	2329	A
i figure instead of doing that i'll just i'll just order wood but	2329	A
uh	2329	A
	2329	A
uh i'm just like you gas mileage wasn't a priority	2329	A
it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air	2329	A
so down down where you guys are	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
it's a necessity yeah	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah that's i had i had gone down to Dallas couple weeks ago	2329	A
uh on a seminar for a week	2329	A
and that's when you broke all the records was up to like ninety six	2329	A
eighties and you know when i left here and we're down to the thirties and twenties and	2329	A
	2329	A
so i can see you yeah and you need air you actually need air now	2329	A
it gets warm enough down there for it	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
oh are you	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic	2329	A
uh how about uh accessories power windows and all that	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
uh	2329	A
so you got a yeah	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so if you know if you know where where you're get getting your your automobile from	2329	A
it's best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is seven percent	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
it's eight percent down there	2329	A
so- who	2329	A
so if you go out and you're talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with	2329	A
and then we have an excise tax up here too i don't know if you have one every year down there	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so they take the they take the uh whatever the book value of the vehicle is	2329	A
and then whatever your tax rate is and they just tax you every year on the vehicle or two vehicles yes it's terrible	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
and in our town we live in a like a rural area	2329	A
and they have a fire tax that they add on too	2329	A
so so we've got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
sounds like you got a a little one there	2329	A
oh	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so once you buy a vehicle and you pay you pay the sales tax that's it they don't tax you on it anymore	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so that's what they consider property tax it's like like if you own your own home you have to pay property tax	2329	A
	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
i still have to pay it yeah that's just like up here too	2329	A
it's like that Mustang that we have	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
the excise tax on it every year there's a minimum you have to pay and and it's only twelve dollars	2329	A
so we've got an automobile that's that's got some class to it but i don't really i can't tell now what kind of a car is coming down or what kind of a car i'm following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it	2329	A
because they all look the same	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah and if you take care of it i mean you can get	2329	A
uh some good mileage out of it	2329	A
because of the the i'm driving a Pontiac now	2329	A
and it's uh it's a sixty seven Pontiac it's got a hundred fifty eight thousand miles on it	2329	A
	2329	A
and it's absolutely gorgeous just i mean just glides along and i still get that good mileage and	2329	A
i take it back and forth to work	2329	A
and then my wife's got a a an eighty four Parisian Pontiac	2329	A
and that's a big car it's a V8 four door	2329	A
and that's got uh	2329	A
a hundred and sixteen thousand miles on it and that runs perfectly well too	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so when we get like i said you know the next one when she decides to to sell the car she has now i'll end up with the Parisian and my wife will have the newer one of course and	2329	A
so we we just been doing it for years and years and years	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
that's incredible	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
yeah if you're going to pay the same amount of money and and you don't really know where it came from	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
then you're buying somebody's headaches probably	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
it's yeah and there's no warranty	2329	A
<silence>	2329	A
so whatever happens to it you're stuck with it	2329	A
unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family member or a like that one	2329	A
	2329	B
okay uh	2329	B
are you in the market for a new car	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
really	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh really	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
well- well that's great	2329	B
if you if you can find a deal like that	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh	2329	B
oh that that that's a classic car	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
next year	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh really	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
i bet that's right i bet that i bet that is true	2329	B
for down- well down here we don't have that problem	2329	B
of course	2329	B
	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh yes we get and then	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
 they sand the roads	2329	B
and it just turns into a big mess	2329	B
	2329	B
so uh but really the when it when it gets uh nasty down here it's like a big huge fender bender parking lot	2329	B
so i just try-	2329	B
nobody goes anywhere	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
well uh a couple years ago we we purchased an uh well it wasn't new- it wasn't new it was a a a an Astro van and	2329	B
we really like it because we got uh a two year old and another one on the way	2329	B
so uh	2329	B
we we had a Firebird and we had to trade we guess we got to get rid of this thing because there's no way we can haul kids and junk and stuff with that so we got rid of that and	2329	B
we're really pleased with it	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yes i can't drive a standard	2329	B
 no i can't drive a standard	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
that's good we	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh oh yeah but yeah uh that's not one of my first priorities when i'm looking for a new car is excellent gas mileage	2329	B
look	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
well my husband has to have a has to drive a pick up so that's so he has his he has a pickup	2329	B
uh he drives a small uh S GMC S fifteen which we bought we bought new five years ago and have had real good luck with i mean there's have absolutely no trouble with it	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh yeah	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
hum	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh yes	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
down here it's a it's it's it's a necessity	2329	B
when it gets to be a hundred degrees every day for a month and a half	2329	B
it's	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh yeah	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah it was it's pretty warm	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
	2329	B
so it's a shock	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah i've i've in the car i've been running it	2329	B
uh uh uh uh because it	2329	B
but uh the the weather- the weather's just been really nice but i mean you you just can't sell a car down here that does not have air conditioning in it	2329	B
like we're from Missouri and when we moved	2329	B
we when we moved down here the our uh the vehicle we had did not have air conditioning and we went through one summer that way and that was it that's when we traded it	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yes	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh that's not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we've never ordered anything fact the the van that we've got we bought uh	2329	B
from an estate- it was an estate trade- uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died	2329	B
so we got a really good deal	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
and it's loaded i mean it it i mean if i would have went to buy that thing new there's no way i could have afforded it	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
but uh since it was a state vehicle we got a really good deal on it but it	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh it's it's eight percent- it's eight here	2329	B
yes- yes	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yes it is it-	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh no	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh how awful	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh how awful	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
	2329	B
oh uh property tax the city of Dallas but uh since we moved out of the city of Dallas we don't have to pay property tax on it anymore	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
right homes vehicles you know everything	2329	B
has- everything like that gets uh taxed property- uh property tax	2329	B
even if you you know if you don't own it yet it- if you're paying off a note you still have to pay property tax on it	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah	2329	B
yes everything look- that's it- i don't i don't foresee buying- us buying an a a vehicle anytime in the near future because we're very pleased with what we've got plus i don't like anything that they've come out with	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh yeah	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
ooh wee	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
well that's great that	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
uh-huh	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
well that that's great you got a hold of a couple of vehicles- uh really good vehicles	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
well down here if you want to go buy a used car it's impossible because they want just as much for a used car as they want for a new car	2329	B
and it it it just does	2329	B
it just doesn't make sense to buy a used car down here	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
oh you have no idea where it comes from you don't-	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
no none	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yes true	2329	B
<silence>	2329	B
yeah	2329	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
oh i'm definitely a player i guess uh there is some question about that when i total up the score but	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
oh i like to uh think putting is probably my uh	2388	B
forte	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
i guess i have the most trouble with chipping how about_1 you	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah i used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slice and so forth but i think i've overcome a good deal of that	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
i've always threatened to take lessons but i've never gotten around to it	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
oh really	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
built that confidence right up there huh	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
that can be bad i mean you know they a lot of people say	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
i think that's mine	2388	B
let me just quick catch it and i'll be back	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
i'm back	2388	B
	2388	B
yeah uh	2388	B
they uh	2388	B
	2388	B
my uh i have an interesting anecdote	2388	B
	2388	B
my uh my uh son who goes up to A&M he's uh had the pleasure of having a hole in one	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
oh thank God i've never been to Midland	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
well one of my uh well control	2388	B
and uh and contact are a big problem and they still are but	2388	B
this one of the things i was doing wrong was too much back swing and hurrying my back swing	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
that sounds like the exact same words my friend tells me	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
it's a frustrating game golf	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
it's getting more expensive unfortunately too	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
like you i haven't played any or not much this year i played couple of times but	2388	B
i went out skiing in February and uh took uh little tumble down the slopes and uh so i'm nursing a wounded wing right	2388	B
	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
<silence>	2388	B
yeah well i love the game so uh i enjoyed talking about it	2388	B
	2388	B
okay enjoyed it	2388	B
bye-bye	2388	B
	2388	B
okay well uh so what do you think about golfing are you a spectator or a player	2388	A
	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
	2388	A
yeah i know how you feel about that that's true	2388	A
 what's what's uh what's the best part of your game do you think	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
um-hum	2388	A
what is your worst then	2388	A
	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
well i think i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was last year i haven't been out this year it's kind of been uh kind of strange i hadn't been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the fairway	2388	A
	2388	A
for you know with drives and stuff um	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
um-hum	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
yeah i've i've gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it's just uh	2388	A
and i can't seem to find the middle space you know but i've i've got a friend of mine working on it uh i've trying to help me out i've been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh a couple of years back but to tell you the truth that for a while hurt more than it helped um because i i and it turned out that i couldn't do anything right after that	2388	A
um	2388	A
even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldn't do that i couldn't couldn't drive couldn't you know in in fact it was it wasn't as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was	2388	A
you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because_1 you know it was	2388	A
it it's kind of a funny story whenever i went for- for my first lesson	2388	A
the uh the instructor takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so he's he's bending down on one knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down	2388	A
and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says we've got a lot of work to do so	2388	A
oh yeah i was feeling real good then so so he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh	2388	A
uh	2388	A
	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
well that's like i said	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
oh yeah	2388	A
ah oh that's definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a son or anything i'm definitely going to uh you know teaching have a have a lesson or something is that yours or mine	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
	2388	A
all right	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
okay	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
what's that	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
oh yeah	2388	A
well uh you know the only person i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
i came so close once just once i mean that's the only time i've ever been any anywhere near but i mean i was uh i used to live out in Midland Texas i don't know if you've ever been out there but it's you know a real windy place	2388	A
 but uh	2388	A
yeah i- i played on a course out there and like i said it's a very windy place so it's you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was about a hundred and i don't know a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three	2388	A
and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a seven wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off but you know over over past the hole but i mean that's as close as i've ever been you know	2388	A
because_1 i'm not you know that's one of my problems is uh is controlling my my uh my irons on a par three so i have a lot of trouble hitting the greens	2388	A
so do you do you like watching it though i mean	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
yeah well that's that's exactly what my friend has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the club on my backswing and and uh	2388	A
and he says that what i do is i'm actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah	2388	A
yeah because_1 it- because_1 i ended up into an inverted C where the uh the weight was on the wrong foot or something so	2388	A
i i've found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i don't you know don't take as big a back swing	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
yeah what's funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a three-quarter backswing or even a half backswing	2388	A
uh my friend says that's you know that's a full backswing and you don't want to go any further than that so i mean it's a now it's a matter of trying to convince myself that that's right	2388	A
 so i don't know it's going to be interesting	2388	A
um that's probably true	2388	A
well	2388	A
oh isn't it though i don't know why i do it	2388	A
oh that's that's one of the worse things about it it really is but uh	2388	A
you know	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
um-hum	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
	2388	A
you know that's it you have to be healthy too that's another point i guess	2388	A
 well i think that's about it	2388	A
<silence>	2388	A
yeah i do too	2388	A
yeah	2388	A
well you take care all right yeah good luck	2388	A
	2388	A
bye	2388	A
	2388	A
<silence>	2333	B
all right so we're supposed to talk about food maybe we'll get a call back saying hey you're not you're not talking about food	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
oh golly well i live in Dallas what what area do you live in	2333	B
North Carolina oh really	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
oh really well	2333	B
in the Carolinas they did have uh	2333	B
huh and Jimmy Baker	2333	B
	2333	B
 he's he's not a subject of great pride	2333	B
	2333	B
oh yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
 twins separated at birth kind of thing	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
i- i i know uh how how did Jessie Helms get reelected that's that's what i want to know	2333	B
what does he do does he just do the people the are there just stupid people where you live or something okay	2333	B
well	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
oh yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
that's too bad because i mean i've been in the Carolinas and you know there are some places in the Carolinas it's really nice there	2333	B
in like	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
 yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
i- i know i think literacy probably the biggest problem there	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
oh really	2333	B
how'd they do that	2333	B
oh let me guess what they did they had classes on the SAT	2333	B
oh really	2333	B
oh Plano Plano started having	2333	B
Plano actually they went out and they had the where where i live they had the they had the classes on the SAT i've never heard anything so preposterous in my life	2333	B
they're preparing people for the test by having a class specifically for the test how ridiculous i mean of course it has the highest	2333	B
SAT rate well it also has the highest teen suicide rate too so i mean that and this is national i don't know where it's all going to where it's all going to go	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
and you know what's bad i mean like i'm going into you know an education related field and i just you know it just	2333	B
you know it really kills me you know i mean it's it it really is a shame that you know you know United States somehow we spend more money on each student	2333	B
and the teachers are paid so little i mean i mean how do how do they figure that out	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
well the prestige of being a teacher is also pretty nil well i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say well since this is a woman dominated field we can treat them like dirt you know	2333	B
that that that must be the rationale for for where it comes from United States	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
hey that's a	2333	B
hey that's a hard job to get really	2333	B
in in in Texas in Texas it's hard because it's almost like a father to son thing	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B

hum	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah my my brother got stationed eventually at at Oxbridge	2333	B
he he really enjoyed it there and well well his his wife was British so they had	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
they had quite a good time	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
i mean	2333	B
a lot of the people i mean it's funny they're just	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
i don't know the standard of living is not as high as you would expect- you would think	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
yeah	2333	B
<silence>	2333	B
<silence>	2333	A
	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
um	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
no no you can talk about anything you want these- these things are just suggestions	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
uh North Carolina	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
it is boring here	2333	A
boring	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
um yes yes we're	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
oh yes it's it's one of our prouder right along with Jessie Helms	2333	A
i think- i think they were pardon the phrase all in bed together or something	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah	2333	A
somebody somebody let the brains run out on the floor though	2333	A
yeah	2333	A
oh man Jim Bakker oh what a what a dangerous individual	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
that's a well that's a good question um	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah basically yeah yeah that's	2333	A
that's that's most of it and he plays very heavily on the race issue	2333	A
and it's still that's still a big thing here in this backwards state	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
uh-huh yeah my favorite place is Ashville it's right over there in the mountains it's a beautiful place	2333	A
it's just that you know i mean if you took all the people out of the state it would be a great place	2333	A
these folks are so backwards it's just ridiculous- it's pathetic	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah and- i i mean the papers are just full of all of this stuff about the educational system they've been changing their standards and this that and the other and- claiming this is going to make everything better	2333	A
uh Durham the county right next to us big city	2333	A
uh had an enormous jump in the uh in the SAT rate	2333	A
and everybody was huh	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
oh no it was even worse than that they falsified the data	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah just just students-	2333	A
	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
	2333	A
	2333	A
right	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
oh well	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
	2333	A
i don't know	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
i don't i don't know what's i mean public education is just going down the tubes i mean they're throwing more and more money at it and it just seems to be getting worse and worse	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
oh yeah	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
i don't know that's that's the one thing that i've i've never been able to figure out why you can pay garbage men more than you can pay teachers	2333	A
um	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
oh yeah	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah i guess	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
it it must be i bet you know i- i i'm not knocking the garbage men i mean they're necessary but there's a lot of unemployed people out there who would gladly take jobs as garbage men rate for less money	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
 it is	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah well it's it's it's hard in New York too and i mean they get paid twenty eight thousand a year to start	2333	A
and teachers only get paid twenty four	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
you bet you	2333	A
you bet you	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
man i'd i'd go out and dump garbage all the time for that kind of money	2333	A
good exercise you get outside	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
shoot-	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
well	2333	A
	2333	A
	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
ah that's what my that's what my garbage man does	2333	A
i went out the other morning and my my garbage can was sitting in the middle of my driveway	2333	A
	2333	A
	2333	A
jeez i i get tired of this i've got a there's a nice little wooden platform out there for the garbage cans and then they just throw them anywhere they want to	2333	A
and sometimes they don't even take everything that- that's the biggest kick	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
the Carolinas	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
no i'm not i'm not a fool	2333	A
uh	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
	2333	A
i've got better things to do with my life	2333	A
	2333	A
when i uh when i was uh stationed in England i used the opportunity to travel around Europe a lot and one of my favorite places to go was Switzerland	2333	A
and it was just great to sit out there in uh Zurich or Bern just sit in the sidewalk cafes	2333	A
and-	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah Salzburg nice Austria is nice Europe is nice	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah	2333	A
yeah really i mean Switzerland is so clean	2333	A
not even a scrap of paper on the ground you know	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah	2333	A
yeah that it's	2333	A
i loved it there though	2333	A
i loved it	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
um well i- i like Europe	2333	A
except for Belgium	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
no	2333	A
yeah i think i do because	2333	A
half of them are yeah half of them are Middle Eastern and the other half are French Expatriates	2333	A
and since i hate the French anyway	2333	A
the Belgians try to act like the French	2333	A
and i it was just miserable i hated that place	2333	A
i hate it almost as much as i do France	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
sure	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
um-hum	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah couldn't even use it	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
	2333	A
	2333	A
	2333	A
yeah really i used to take the ferry over from Dover over to Calais and and and and drive across France uh horrible i only did that one time	2333	A
	2333	A
uh Mildenhall	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
oh good old Bent Waters	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah that's a nice place	2333	A
Bent Waters is a is a very nice little place- nice little base out in the country	2333	A
nobody messes with them a lot Mildenhall was pretty uh	2333	A
well it was big and it got a lot of attention	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
but uh	2333	A
yeah Bent Waters Upper Hafford	2333	A
all those neat little places that's where i really wanted to be	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
oh Oxbridge yeah	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
yeah Oxbridge is nice	2333	A
ah everywhere in England is nice	2333	A
<silence>	2333	A
but on the other hand it's it's in a way it's better	2333	A
that- what- that's what i like about it for one thing everything was cheap	2333	A
um	2333	A
i mean i can still remember going going to the store and getting a pint of milk a pound of butter and a loaf of bread and getting change back from my pound	2333	A
you know you can't even buy a loaf of bread in this country	2333	A
	2377	A
well i'm uh an engineer so i'm heartedly in favor of this country converting to metric	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
uh-huh	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
Yeah well i think uh you know from an elementary standpoint it would help to get rid of some of the the oddball conversion units like	2377	A
twelve inches to the foot and	2377	A
thirty six inches to the yard and things like that but uh i think uh from my work experience i found	2377	A
well when- in college	2377	A
i learned uh to use a rationalized system of measure which turned out to be the metric system	2377	A
and an awful lot of the problems that we did on exams and our homework assignments and everything else involved converting	2377	A
from uh English units or nonstandard units into this uh rationalized M K F system	2377	A
and uh so i became quite accustomed to uh to a rationalized system and and used to making all the necessary conversions	2377	A
and since then i have discovered uh other engineers are very prone to make mistakes	2377	A
because they will pick up a textbook and uh and find some formula for solving a problem	2377	A
and they fail to realize that the formula is expressed in the the rationalized M K F system and they'll proceed to plug in inches and feet and pounds and uh things like that and they come up with a funniest answers you ever you can imagine	2377	A
and some of them don't realize that they've made a mistake and so uh you know a lot of energy and uh a lot of work and so forth uh goes into building something only to discover it doesn't work	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
Yeah	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
Yeah	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
 i kind of agree that uh maybe ten on or twenty years ago we should have gone into a uh sort of a dual display arrangement where you know our our speed limit signs were	2377	A
were sort of a double sign with a a big miles per hour and a little kilometers per hour type uh marking on the side	2377	A
	2377	A
uh and little things like that i i notice in a lot of uh	2377	A
uh technical literature that you pick up and catalogs and so forth that you will find the metric units expressed in parenthesis or sometimes the other way around the metric units are expressed first	2377	A
and then the English equivalent that's uh is put into parenthesis for reference	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
yeah	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
you know i think also equally important is that uh it needs to be put into practice in in everyday life we're seeing a little bit of it now that you go out to work on your car and you discover your English wrenches don't fit	2377	A
 you've got to go out and buy a metric set	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
uh-huh	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
i was a little disappointed that uh United States is lagging the rest of the world but all of the other countries in the world have made the change and even the British which are probably the most stodgy	2377	A
population and the originator of our English system of measure uh they have gone metric	2377	A
yeah	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
right	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
uh-huh	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
yeah	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
I	2377	A
i think one of the other concepts that uh comes along with using a rationalized system of measure is uh a technique of keeping track of units	2377	A
when you're solving a problem that if you're sitting there trying to uh establish a relationship with some physical system uh when you come up with your final formula if you analyze the units of measure they should come out right	2377	A
and the the basic units of measure are are distance and time and mass and electric charge	2377	A
and so if you convert all your measure into those uh fundamental units and analyze them you can uh get a pretty good sense as to whether your formula is correct	2377	A
	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
Well i	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
most of them have uh the option the American American made cars have uh uh the miles per hour as the big scale and they're little tick marks uh sort of hidden on the scale which shows kilometers per hour	2377	A
But those that are manufactured for sale in in Europe and so forth are quite the other way around	2377	A
and in a lot of the Japanese cars that come to this country particularly those that have the uh electronic panels there's a little push button some place on the panel that you can switch between uh kilometers per hour and miles per hour	2377	A
my wife's uh Chrysler convertible has little buttons that you can choose what display you want to see	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
Yeah i noticed my van has a uh a button on the temperature gauge that you can switch between centigrade and fahrenheit	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
yeah	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
well we also need to be a little bit careful and maybe we start	2377	A
to not use the English measure anymore like when you listen to the weather forecast the the weather man may give the temperature in centigrade and fahrenheit and everybody ignores the centigrade and listens to the fahrenheit to the fahrenheit	2377	A
and we we sort of have to get accustomed to the fact that our body temperature is thirty seven degrees centigrade yes	2377	A
and that it's a nice day when it's twenty five degrees outside	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
yeah the Europeans think that you're baby is boiling over	2377	A
	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
Yeah	2377	A
<silence>	2377	A
no i hope we get to the point where maybe a couple of generations from now when somebody reads the old adage	2377	A
<silence>	2377	B
i bet you are i bet you are i don't know you know when i was in uh when i was in high school several years ago you know we did probably	2377	B
two or two or three weeks on the subject you know and tried to teach you the whole thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really don't care anyway and i didn't get into it very much but then i took a a list of basic math class a couple of semesters ago	2377	B
and we uh we were pretty heavily into the metric system and and before we started i just thought oh no i don't want to do this you know this is just going to be so hard and once i really realized how easy it was	2377	B
uh it was wonderful i mean it was just incredible how much simpler it is than what you know i guess we just all have this mind set that oh this is so hard and we can't do this	2377	B
and it's really not hard i was surprised at how very easy it was i think most people just uh	2377	B
you know automatically have their minds set against it and don't give it a chance you know so	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
oh sure	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
exactly exactly	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
um-hum	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
yeah	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
 it just don't work	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
i bet i bet	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
right right well you know i think that the that the only way that we are ever going to get this country switched over to metrics is just to start other with with the kids right now	2377	B
you know you you you're going to have to start with the kids who are in school- that are in when school and you're going to have to teach it well not like when i was in school and do two weeks on it in a math class and that's all you ever hear about it you know they're going to have to start	2377	B
with the little ones and teach it right now and then when you know those little ones are our age you know that's what they're going to know and that's what they're going to use there's no way you're going to get you know most of the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch	2377	B
you know it's just not going to happen that way but i do think if they would start with the kids now at you know in you know twenty years from now we could be switched over	2377	B
you know	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
yeah	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
yeah i agree	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
they'll	2377	B
very good idea yeah yeah	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
yeah i think i think it's going to take that but i you know i- i think it's going to take a lot more than that too you know it's going to take it's going to take this education with our- with our kids i really believe that but you know	2377	B
 we we knew that we weren't going to have to ever use it again we knew we were going to have two or three weeks of it in math class so why take the time to really learn it	2377	B
you know i mean you would just you know learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of school	2377	B
you know and and that that's not the way to convert over you're gonna have to have these kids you know teaching it dually even you know teaching both systems which is a lot i know a lot more for the teachers to have to teach but that's the only way they're going to get switched over you know	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
oh yes yeah	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
yeah yeah that's true too that's true	2377	B
buy a whole knew metric set yeah	2377	B
well i think you know it's something that's going to take quite some time to happen	2377	B
but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
oh yeah	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
yeah	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
even they have switched yeah so yeah we're not uh we're not necessarily on the cutting edge in everything are we just like we think we are	2377	B
so well i think eventually it will happen you know it's just going to take it's just going to take a lot of education and a lot of time and like i said i was just totally amazed at how at how very easy it was you know i i just couldn't	2377	B
you know i just when i going into it i just had this block and i went there's just no way i'm going to be able to learn this and when i sat down and really said okay just you know forget your old prejudices and really look at it you know and once you look at it's so really simple you know you	2377	B
there's really nothing to memorize there's nothing to learn it just all works the same you know you just you know transform that little you know dot from one place one one way to the other you know and that's about all you have to do so anyway i think it will happen eventually	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
right right	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
well you know i think uh i think it's going to happen i don't know i don't know what else i could suggest to them you know if they ask me what should we do	2377	B
i don't know i wouldn't know what else to suggest to them just education start with these little kids you know and like you said you know start making it practice you know start showing all the street signs and all the cars- of course i think all the cars are manufactured that way they aren't aren't all of them	2377	B
most of the new ones i'm seeing are are made with miles per hour and kilometers on them	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
oh really	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
right	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
uh-huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
right	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
is there really huh	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
well that's interesting yeah well	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
oh well that's interesting too i had never seen that yeah no you know you look at most of the you know like the bank clocks and stuff like that it tells you you know fahrenheit and centigrade and it's going take those kinds of things you know switching you know	2377	B
getting us all accustomed to seeing both you know but most people don't pay any attention you know it's going to take some education right along with it most people don't know what that means you know so	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
that's right because that's what they're familiar with	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
right that's going to be hard to do it's going to be very hard to do you know you	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
	2377	B
	2377	B
	2377	B
that's right that's right your baby's still alive with hundred and three so you know it it's going to take a changing lot of our old prejudices and you know just	2377	B
making up our minds that yes we are going to do this and we're just going to forgot this old way and we're just going to do it you know and i don't think the older generation is probably ready to do that you know	2377	B
	2377	B
<silence>	2377	B
<silence>	2370	B
so well you're- you're- you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
uh-huh	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah you you weren't supposed to want a job	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah but but	2370	B
but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
did you	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
oh yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there	2370	B
but uh if you're going to be more professional- professional oriented	2370	B
then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that	2370	B
that doesn't really go with the family	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
oh yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
oh okay you've found something else	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides	2370	B
the same person every day	2370	B
yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and	2370	B
and if it's not	2370	B
if it's not mom then then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
uh-huh	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know whose- whose job is this	2370	B
well it's- it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to	2370	B
so uh	2370	B
to me- yeah to yeah to me-	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah well	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
and you you you	2370	B
yeah you talk yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
and- and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and and that's a very hard attitude to change	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
hm uh	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas	2370	B
to so that they know that uh you know male and female are both responsible for doing this and	2370	B
and uh	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
uh-huh	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because	2370	B
mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility	2370	B
and i i think that's happened in a lot of cases	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum um you know some time day care is really good but sometimes it's just it's baby sitting it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any	2370	B
relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right and here's what's wrong and and here's what we expect of you	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
um-hum	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah i'm i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something	2370	B
	2370	B
 yeah well she's usually in bed by this time but she's staying up late tonight but yeah you know i want to i want to have a relationship with her you know my- my dad was a very traditional dad and when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well and i miss that	2370	B
and i want	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
yeah the men have to be convinced of that	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
no	2370	B
<silence>	2370	B
<silence>	2370	A
 i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last generation- well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from well	2370	A
take it back thirty years i'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home	2370	A
period and- and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married	2370	A
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it	2370	A
until the kids you were little	2370	A
yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day	2370	A
and then	2370	A
and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job	2370	A
and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are	2370	A
who are totally prepared to teach- to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and	2370	A
and uh we'll see how the generations go huh	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've i was an engineer with uh	2370	A
mechanical engineer with T I	2370	A
and uh i did it for six years	2370	A
and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old	2370	A
and and it just drove me crazy	2370	A
i could not do either well enough- i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necessary- or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays	2370	A
as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country	2370	A
also with uh with work for like three months and and	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
it might have been better	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer i'm i'm i'm a photographer now	2370	A
i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer	2370	A
that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years	2370	A
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else	2370	A
to do	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah and it's- it's great while they're really little but as they get older	2370	A
and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do	2370	A
and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and you- you know and not really school but	2370	A
but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society	2370	A
yeah i think they do too	2370	A
and i need it for the break so	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
um-hum	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
and enjoy it that's that's the whole thing	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next	2370	A
ten years- even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time	2370	A
because if if i if i had been allowed to work	2370	A
you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week	2370	A
i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy	2370	A
and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do the the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures	2370	A
in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids	2370	A
can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know and- and- when he's at home can take care of them	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well	2370	A
it's going to have to be both	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
you know it's just convincing your husband that's important or that that that it's important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom	2370	A
doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it	2370	A
in that other you know uh that i should do it or that- or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help	2370	A
and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now no	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yes and	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it	2370	A
they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and	2370	A
and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be done- this is the time this needs to be done but	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
that's right	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
um-hum	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
um-hum	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much	2370	A
this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were	2370	A
needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
and it's gonna	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
it's gonna yeah some kids are really having it If they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't	2370	A
 yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values	2370	A
and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little	2370	A
you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because_1 i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older	2370	A
but if no one does anything when they're little	2370	A
then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
 yes i understand i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls	2370	A
	2370	A
yeah	2370	A
<silence>	2370	A
that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work	2370	A
but i think	2370	A
if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know i know mine almost never did	2370	A
<silence>	2337	A
sure	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
okay	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
is it	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
well um	2337	A
yeah i'd	2337	A
i agree with the the ease in the use of it	2337	A
and uh	2337	A
the it certainly it's so much easier to do your do computations calculations to measure things with it to in every every aspect of it is simpler except there is one big stumbling block in it	2337	A
and in the United States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has been here for the last hundred years is in the English system	2337	A
and tool and die equipment doesn't wear out too often	2337	A
so i think that's the the one place where	2337	A
uh they will have a hard time uh getting people to change	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
sure	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
exactly	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right i uh lived in Brazil for four years from when i was seven to eleven years old and	2337	A
so by the time i got into high school and took some physics there and then into college um where i was a physics major in college so i'm more than	2337	A
uh familiar with the metric system	2337	A
and uh	2337	A
but	2337	A
i think that initial period you know from way made it familiar for me so i wasn't afraid of the metric system and it and and i knew how much it made sense and how much easier it was to do things that way	2337	A
so i i it's too bad that more Americans can't don't have the opportunity to to really use it	2337	A
to to get to a point where it it's something other than something that causes them fear and confusion	2337	A
because if you just	2337	A
the initial- in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that ultimately will be simpler are going to be confusing	2337	A
and it's getting over that hurdle that will	2337	A
finally get us into it if if we ever get into it	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
okay	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
yep	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right right that may be true also i don't know chemists seem to	2337	A
it	2337	A
okay	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
no	2337	A
i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calculations- i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics in the English system at this point although gosh all those	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right it's interesting in the in though the work i'm doing i'm uh	2337	A
uh the kind of things i do is manage uh research and development contracts and we do everything from	2337	A
basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually um places where they're producing a product	2337	A
and what i've noticed is that the places where they're kind of doing fuzzy thinking and uh	2337	A
doing the initial uh	2337	A
development of an idea use the metric system	2337	A
and they talk in terms of metric uh uh units	2337	A
in turn around the people however that have the engineers that are actually producing a product	2337	A
do most of their carry conduct most of their discussion in terms of the English units	2337	A
which i i find	2337	A
it's interesting that it's like the guys that are still doing the work that are actually making the stuff are using the English system	2337	A
but the ones that come up with the they're doing these theoretical analysis and the number crunching um	2337	A
are doing it in terms of the metric system i i	2337	A
it kind of seems strange	2337	A
but	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
and Sao Paulo	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
no kidding uh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
and do you fly into Camgonias or the the other one down there down south	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
yeah okay the international airport-	2337	A
yeah	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
sure sure	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh the Air Force Academy	2337	A
uh i'm one of those	2337	A
 yeah	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
no no i'm i'm still in the i'm still a second lieutenant	2337	A
i just graduated in eighty nine	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
oh that's it you got to	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
oh yeah	2337	A
right	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
well the the whole	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
yeah i don't	2337	A
<silence>	2337	A
or the whole number system is digital so how can you have uh or it's it's base ten rather and so how can you have	2337	A
how can you have these uh strange- i- i-	2337	A
	2337	B
okay Brian i going to press number one and we'll go	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
hey um uh Ronnie i think my first introduction to the metric system was in physics in college and i think prior to that i didn't even realize that another system existed	2337	B
uh but it makes so darn much sense to me	2337	B
over the English system i i i have a hard time understanding why people don't take to it	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
yeah i understand	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
no no	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
yeah and i noticed that too in uh in uh uh metal stamp metal parts that we buy	2337	B
we at one time went back through and dual dual dimensioned them all	2337	B
and uh you know it's uh it's easy to put down point O O one inches or one mil	2337	B
uh it's kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent	2337	B
uh in in terms of the numbers that you've got to carry around i guess one of the things i i think metrically	2337	B
i've got a uh a and it drives my wife crazy you know she'll say how far is it from here to somewhere she wants to go and i'll say oh about eight kilometers	2337	B
and she'll look at me and give me this crazy look but my uh my my uh hobby is distance running	2337	B
and basically all of the races now are five K ten K fifteen K nobody runs in terms of miles anymore	2337	B
uh and i guess that's got me thinking metrically	2337	B
also uh uh we have lived overseas uh from nineteen eighty one to eighty four we lived in Quadalampor Malaysia	2337	B
and for in eighty five six and seven we lived in Baggio City in the Philippines	2337	B
and i guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked metrically	2337	B
and ultimately at some point you know it doesn't happen overnight but at some point your frame of reference is metric at least in terms of distances	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
okay	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
oh yes yes	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
yeah	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
yeah i i i don't think it's going to happen in in in our lifetime at least not in mine	2337	B
uh i think uh there's a gigantic psychological barrier which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die uh dimension in English	2337	B
uh and i think that the uh the ultimate solution will be to start introducing it uh in at at the introduction to school	2337	B
	2337	B
and uh hang on a sec Brian i got to get rid of that caller	2337	B
	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
 are you there	2337	B
okay i think the uh uh the solution is to start it at the earliest uh stages of schooling	2337	B
and uh uh make that the system to which kindergartners and first graders are introduced	2337	B
uh the drawback to that is i don't think we have any teachers in our other than physics teachers in our school system that are comfortable with it	2337	B
	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
and and chemists that's what i got my first degree in chemistry too and i and i and you know we don't talk in quarts and pints we talk in liters and milliliters	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
oh yeah i i i don't think we could even think English uh and i'm just thinking now in our business you know we make we make chips and uh we assemble them though	2337	B
and it's interesting we are uh uh basically talking well we talk about a package size yeah we talk about it in terms of uh uh six hundred mils or six uh tenths of an inch i guess we do that	2337	B
but on the other hand we talk about the force that it takes uh to move a die out of a package in other words how much uh uh how how well do we have the die uh inhering to the uh to the base	2337	B
and we talk about that in terms of kilograms	2337	B
so we use it a lot uh we talk about uh gold ball bonds uh bond strength we talk about that in terms of grams or in terms of kilograms to push the uh push the ball off its substrate	2337	B
so we we tend to have a mixed bag in new concepts uh that have come along with the electronic age i think just sort of get introduced metrically so that's the way we do it	2337	B
uh	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
uh-huh	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
right uh you you mentioned just a side light here you mentioned you lived in Brazil whereabouts	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
oh Sao Paulo our our plant there is in Cantinas	2337	B
and i'm there several times a year	2337	B
uh and of course we fly into Sao Paulo and and drive on to uh uh Cantinas	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
uh i use the other one	2337	B
i can't think the name of it	2337	B
yeah the international airport because i i generally fly in from uh well the last two times i've come in from Mexico City via Menaus	2337	B
and uh before that though it's uh it's uh Miami uh Rio De Janeiro Sao Paulo uh type flight	2337	B
and uh i just love it there i i absolutely uh uh uh love the i look forward to the times i go down there where did you get your from where did you get your physics degree	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
oh okay okay	2337	B
yeah you like Colorado are are you a civilian employee about now or or military	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
oh okay	2337	B
oh okay okay you're you're you- you're a bit younger than i thought uh back to the the metric system	2337	B
i've got a uh an automobile an eighty six Buick Skylark that's got an odometer uh that's a digital odometer in both units in other words i can push a button and it's in metric and i can push a button and it's in English	2337	B
and i i keep it in the metric uh all the all the time and we were taking another couple to a ball game last summer	2337	B
and it was uh floating up there around a a a hundred a hundred which is about is about sixty two miles an hour and it was floating up there about a hundred and the wife of the couple looked at me she said my God slow down i didn't realize you were going this fast	2337	B
and so we we you know we have a hard time getting people getting uh uh getting them to think metrically but	2337	B
it's going to be a big psychological barrier and i don't think that we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to them	2337	B
because if we if we keep doing that it's it's not going to work	2337	B
but	2337	B
but but interestingly enough we think it makes sense to to think metrically with our money	2337	B
you know ten cents makes a dime ten dimes makes a dollar uh which is basically thinking metrically	2337	B
uh but but why twelve inches make a feet a foot and three feet make a yard i you know	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
yeah	2337	B
<silence>	2337	B
hello	2018	B
hi	2018	B
hi this is Lisa	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
um-hum	2018	B
yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
um-hum	2018	B
yeah	2018	B
-it's kind of an easy thing to talk about	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
yeah	2018	B
um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
okay yes	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
yes i know because_1	2018	B
i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i've never faced that at all	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
uh-huh	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
yeah um-hum i think it's definitely gotten better	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
um-hum	2018	B
because_1 women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
yeah	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh	2018	B
	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
yeah	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
um-hum	2018	B
and then	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
um-hum	2018	B
also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or	2018	B
is it	2018	B
that would be great	2018	B
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on LOA to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house	2018	B
and she- you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too	2018	B
i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office	2018	B
so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing	2018	B
do you	2018	B
do you work like half days or half weeks or	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
hm	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
oh is oh that's great	2018	B
uh-huh do you get the full benefits	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
oh that's wonderful	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
yeah especially_1 with children and so many things going on that would be great	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
either way yeah you have your career and your home life and that'd be a nice way to especially_1 if you have young children	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
um-hum	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that	2018	B
yeah	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
 i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful	2018	B
plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because_1 you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours that's been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening	2018	B
so that's real helpful so you don't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don't know how many times i've done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand	2018	B
so	2018	B
uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because_1 i just it's always been that way but i know	2018	B
<silence>	2018	B
oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did	2018	B
i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and work- women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but	2018	B
mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward	2018	B
yeah i think it's getting better not worse	2018	B
well i should probably get back to my job	2018	B
 call again	2018	B
okay bye-bye	2018	B
	2018	B
hello this is Lois	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
and um i called you know from that the the TI Database Calling Instructions	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
yeah this is about changes in women in the	2018	A
	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it it uh	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
okay	2018	A
	2018	A
all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um no i think now- now you go to work when they're six weeks old you know and you stay there and i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
oh i do too much and it's just gonna get better it really is	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
oh i can't either not a one	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
yeah even in Washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
yes yes	2018	A
oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it	2018	A
yes yeah yes	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um yeah	2018	A
yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social security numbers you know and that way they can't say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know you yeah yeah	2018	A
yeah they'll just i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
and if you get it you know then	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
oh yeah uh-huh as a matter of fact that's what i'm doing um-hum it sure is it sure is	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
oh	2018	A
uh-huh	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
yeah yes that is	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
yeah	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
oh	2018	A
oh i do i really do i think it's great	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
uh well like one week she'll work three days and i'll work two and the next week you know i'll work three and she'll work two we just share off like that	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum yeah we get the full benefits but we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under yeah	2018	A
yes	2018	A
it really is and that way we're not really missing anything out you know of those children uh-huh	2018	A
um-hum yes oh it is	2018	A
it is well both of ours is school age but we don't want to miss any of those PTA's and you know all of that so so	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
yeah	2018	A
yes i think it's great i really and i look for more of that in the next generation	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
yes oh i do too yes	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
but yeah yeah because_1 most time now you know it's just a weekend or just forget it yeah-	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
uh-huh	2018	A
oh yeah	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
to do yeah	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum yeah i think we've really come a long ways in that because yes	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
yeah but i can remember- remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off	2018	A
oh yes	2018	A
um-hum	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
where oh yeah yes	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
oh i do too	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
yes yes yes	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
um-hum they really are	2018	A
<silence>	2018	A
	2018	A
	2018	A
<silence>	2051	B
right	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
where is that	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
north south east or west	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well you live almost in Oklahoma	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
yeah that's kind of ironic because i don't live too far from Oklahoma either	2051	B
you know where Saint Joe is	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
i'm about eight miles south of it	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well you know	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
i've i've seen those statistics and everything	2051	B
and you know what frightens me	2051	B
is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert	2051	B
with high tech weaponry	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
you know i mean	2051	B
the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that	2051	B
and they didn't kill as many people in	2051	B
in forty five days	2051	B
and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job	2051	B
as they killed in Washington DC	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well	2051	B
i formulated a pretty radical theory	2051	B
over the last ten years i guess	2051	B
and	2051	B
i've come to the conclusion	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
and this is	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
a pretty scary thought to me even	2051	B
that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime	2051	B
rather than put them in prison because_1 prison's proven not to work	2051	B
just let them_1 go	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
say okay you're convicted	2051	B
and just let them_1 go	2051	B
and if they get convicted again	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well just kill them_1	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well i think that	2051	B
the best hope	2051	B
to eliminate	2051	B
crime	2051	B
as we know it today	2051	B
is to eliminate the criminals from society	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
if someone is known to have been in prison they can't get a job	2051	B
you know they can't be accepted into society	2051	B
you know if they're not going to be accepted into society then everybody's going to become sociopathic	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
and you know who's to put the limit on it	2051	B
i mean i was watching a thing last night up in Washington State	2051	B
if you get convicted of uh	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
sexual offenses	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
	2051	B
and they're still let out on the street after one or two years	2051	B
well in Washington State if you're a habitual sexual offender	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
they just don't let you out	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
uh you serve your prison term	2051	B
and then you go into the mental hospital and if you're pronounced cured they'll let you go	2051	B
well	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now	2051	B
you know	2051	B
hey people make mistakes	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well	2051	B
yeah use that or you know there's other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
you know	2051	B
at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against	2051	B
feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
but uh you know with the technology- technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg	2051	B
that will knock him down if they leave the property	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
i mean it will just in incapacitate them_1	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
and you can put a collar around a guys leg	2051	B
that will	2051	B
prohibit them	2051	B
from committing any kind of	2051	B
you know prohibitive act	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
but you know putting them_1 in prison my God that doesn't work	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well you look at places like Turkey	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
Turkey has death penalty for just about everything	2051	B
i mean if you get	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you	2051	B
you get convicted of uh	2051	B
you know uh heinous crimes	2051	B
they just kill you i mean there's no two ways about it	2051	B
and uh	2051	B
you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
you know and you look at our society	2051	B
almost everyone out on the street	2051	B
that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times	2051	B
right i mean you know	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
you know the way to stop that kind of behavior	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
is this two fold	2051	B
one	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
you need to make it illegal for	2051	B
both parents to work while the kids are under seven	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
i- i think that's very important	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
and then	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
if a parent has proved to be unfit	2051	B
for any reason	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
take the kids away from the parents	2051	B
because_1	2051	B
you know we are what we teach	2051	B
because that's what our society becomes i mean we have a just a bunch of people	2051	B
and i've and i've i've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work	2051	B
you know and these guys they come to work every morning and they're stoned to the bone	2051	B
i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building	2051	B
and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs	2051	B
and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on Monday	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
and the kids of these people	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
are phenomenally	2051	B
they're sociopathic	2051	B
and i worked in a first grade uh classroom	2051	B
for one full semester	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
and these kids were more foul mouthed than i've ever been	2051	B
i had one kid threaten my life first grader	2051	B
threaten my life told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
you know and they flipping me the finger and all that	2051	B
and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die	2051	B
because you will eventually be killed	2051	B
and you know i just i'm just totally aghast- aghast at a what's going on	2051	B
um-hum	2051	B
exactly	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
well you can see it in the work place	2051	B
you know	2051	B
used to be when you had a	2051	B
personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it	2051	B
now	2051	B
you know people get fired	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
or	2051	B
	2051	B
what's even worse is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them_1 get fired	2051	B
or one thing or the other you look at another kind of society like the Japanese	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
you put	2051	B
that many people on that small of a space they've learned to live together	2051	B
okay it's in their culture	2051	B
and one of the things that's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while Japan was becoming a great power financially	2051	B
the people that worked for those companies	2051	B
worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen	2051	B
and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people	2051	B
if they weren't fit for the job they were hired for they didn't just can them_1	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
they made a position for them_1 some where	2051	B
uh you look at uh Frito Lay my wife used to work for Frito Lay	2051	B
as a typist	2051	B
you know transcribing stuff into the computer	2051	B
well she can type about one hundred and five words per minute	2051	B
but she don't like it	2051	B
<silence>	2051	B
she she just doesn't like to do that i mean she will	2051	B
but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is	2051	B
all right um i think the topic was crime in the city	2051	A
i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place	2051	A
uh it's about thirty miles from Sherman	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
it's north of Sherman	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh it not too far	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh i've been through there	2051	A
okay oh yeah i had been through Saint Joe but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
oh yeah	2051	A
sure	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
oh i know i know	2051	A
i know um people- i think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
 um-hum yeah because uh most likely that will happen won't it that you know	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
no	2051	A
yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
hum	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
hum so you're you're kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time that's not real bad you know	2051	A
yeah to go ahead and let them_1 go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
oh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A
yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
no apparently not because_1 look how many years they've been doing that and look i mean yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
three or four times yeah	2051	A
that is true i know	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum oh i'm i agree very much so on that i yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
um-hum	2051	A

if they see violence at home that's what you're going to get from the kids at school you know it really is	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
and that's kind of sad	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A

<silence>	2051	A
huh uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
uh-huh	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
cause yeah	2051	A
<silence>	2051	A
<silence>	2044	B
my husband's been in Dallas during an ice storm he said that he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped just slid to the side of the curb that they're that bad Lubbock	2044	B
we get ice storms but not not quite to that extent it's not the thin sheet you know all across the road ours if it ices over it's thick it's with snow it's something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with	2044	B
uh i think we've been fortunate that we've missed	2044	B
any of the real bad weather this year because we went to California instead but right now	2044	B
um we're having unusually warm weather it's it's almost like they're trying- it's trying to skip spring and go straight to summer it's either	2044	B
uh thirty degrees you know one day and ninety the next and and we're missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well i have been here permanently or full time since nineteen eighty and uh	2044	B
pretty much off and on since seventy four so really quite a while and i've watched the weather shift you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college and the spring dust storms were	2044	B
uh they were massive i mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see buildings across the street	2044	B
that dust yeah not fun to be in but i haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years	2044	B
so it's it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but	2044	B
i guess i can live with it	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
um-hum	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
um-hum	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
that's true	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well now does Dallas get snow or is it usually just the ice storm	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
okay	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well that was one reason why i figured that i could stand Lubbock Texas that was about as much winter as i could get because i grew up west coast sunshine green leaves on trees	2044	B
came back here and could not realize why i'd been so depressed through the winter	2044	B
and realized that that was the first time in my life i had seen trees lose their leaves and uh and course when spring and everything came out again	2044	B
uh it was beautiful but that's about as much winter as i can take i mean it gets cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets you know fifteen twenty degrees below because of the wind	2044	B
but it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
um-hum	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
yeah	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well now when did winter start there you said you had more winter than summer	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
now was there actually snow on the ground all that- that time from September through what March	2044	B
oh goodness	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
uh-huh	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
oh	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
oh my goodness	2044	B
well now was that expected though i mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due to the delays or	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
yeah	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
everything stops yeah	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well now do you work at TI	2044	B
i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in Dallas uh that we would be up here trying to call and it we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody at work	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
oh okay	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
 hop skip and a jump there you go	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well that's good	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well are you uh do you prefer the kind of weather that you're getting in Dallas over your years in New Hampshire or do you miss the winters or	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
oh my goodness	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
sure once you're out of the house you're in the street	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
 that's good i did go up to New England one time during their fall season when the weather was just	2044	B
you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't freezing the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there i could truly love but uh	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
uh-oh well what about your summers in Dallas now is that similar was it humid up in the New England states like it is down there	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
yeah	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
well so that's really no big tell- i tell you what that's funny to hear you talk about that because for me to come to Dallas in the summer	2044	B
is stifling humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry uh you know it may be a hundred and a hundred and five or whatever up here but there is no humidity and it's	2044	B
you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again	2044	B
yeah	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
oh	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
yeah	2044	B
<silence>	2044	B
<silence>	2044	A
i guess we're um uh we're we're experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter	2044	A
uh we've had a lot more warm weather than usual and we haven't had any ice storms uh usually we have at least one	2044	A
um course i've only lived here three years but uh but that in- still in that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah yeah yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
oh	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
right that's right it's it's the same way here how long have you lived in Lubbock	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
uh-huh	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
wow yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
dust storms whoa yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
huh	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at the very beginning of the year nineteen eighty seven	2044	A
and uh we when we left- we moved from New Hampshire where it was snowing	2044	A
 and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like Eskimos and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm	2044	A
uh where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather	2044	A
and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather but um	2044	A
uh and i just i just assumed that was the way it was you know you didn't get snow which was nice because_1 you didn't have to shovel it	2044	A
and but you always- you could expect to have this ice storm and i think there was in the three years we've been here there's been one other ice storm	2044	A
um you- the second year we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didn't have anything like that this year	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
it it uh well- it if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass	2044	A
you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about um	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
oh	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
sure	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
right yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
right	2044	A
 well that's the thing uh with us too it's uh just- we just	2044	A
you know in up in New England you had more winter than you had a summer- summer and uh you could expect a long winter period uh for instance um	2044	A
we could- you could- uh in New England it would still be cold i mean ice cold snow kind of weather uh now in March it just- in March is is just when things	2044	A
start uh approaching the fifty degree mark and- course we've already had eighty degree weather here and day- day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
 oh winter would start oh yeah winter would start uh in September it would start getting cold in September	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
there could be yeah there could be and- and it came i mean i used to i used to work in Boston which was an hour and a half away	2044	A
and i would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out driveway	2044	A
and that's so i could leave by seven	2044	A
and uh so i would sometimes take me you know an hour or two to shovel the driveway in the morning and then i'd sitting in that car for an hour an a half	2044	A
and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work	2044	A
so and so now it takes me ten minutes	2044	A
oh yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
uh well they not they didn't expect you to be on time but they did expect you to be there and you- the schools well you know they also did a very good job of of shoveling the the streets	2044	A
they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here	2044	A
if you have a bad snow nobody's prepared to do anything about it you know the	2044	A
right right you know you you- you'd you get the first you know the first- first ice	2044	A
uh storm and the place closes up	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yes uh-huh	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
	2044	A
and uh and so i usually i can usually make it in it's just a hop jump and a	2044	A
uh whatever the expression is i'm i'm real close right um but uh yeah i'd i'd hate to have to get it go to Dallas- drive into Dallas when the weather's like that	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
oh yeah oh yeah well it's like i keep telling people you don't have to shovel sunshine you know it's uh it's uh	2044	A
it's just great i mean we're really spoiled i mean there's a lot of things we miss about New England you know uh uh where there's no trees to speak of and the big	2044	A
you know thick trees we used to have in New England and we used to enjoy it we had a we had two acres of land attached to our house course we only had a thousand square foot house but we had two acres of land and um	2044	A
and so we that now we have this we have a house that's three times as big but we have less than a quarter acre lot you know and uh and uh	2044	A
that's right and uh so we kind of it's- it's we've gone from one extreme to the other and that's that's been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we can't- oh the weather's been wonderful	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
oh yeah- yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break uh you know when the air's real brisk and the	2044	A
the colors on the trees are just so vivid um oh it was just that that's something i miss i- i keep i'm i get homesick thinking about it you know	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
oh yeah humid very humid in New England i mean you got hundred degree weather i mean in- in in like in the Boston area i Boston's right on the water	2044	A
and uh you'd have these hundred degree days where the humidity was just one- hundred percent and it was stifling	2044	A
uh here you- in in Dallas in the Dallas area the humidity you get some humid days but it's not nearly as bad you get- you get a lot of dry days too	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
is it is it okay	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
okay	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
oh	2044	A
	2044	A
<silence>	2044	A
yeah	2044	A
yeah everything's relative i guess yeah because_1 i grew up on the east coast	2044	A
and uh i'm originally from Virginia and uh and my memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity	2044	A
and compared to the humidity here	2044	A
you know in fact uh whenever i think about moving- you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling summers which which i don't experience here	2044	A
 okay i'll let you start first okay	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he's in electronics but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it	2079	A
so it took him about two and a half years	2079	A
but uh he built us a house	2079	A
it's uh we have thirty two hundred square feet	2079	A
and it's a brick house	2079	A
and {pricewise} it wasn't great because he did it all {hisself} you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it	2079	A
and um we live in kind of a small town	2079	A
and i mean it's nothing fancy you know it's it's a house it's nice and it's real pretty and we're all comfortable in it	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else	2079	A
you know	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
so but uh of course my husband did everything except my brother's a trim carpenter and he came in you know and did the inside for us	2079	A
and that helped and- and uh yes and uh we had to hire course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know he did everything else	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
we've been in it six years	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
no- no well- well uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we don't need such a large house	2079	A
	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
um	2079	A
uh-huh	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
yeah oh	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
uh-huh	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
yes	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
but uh like i said otherwise you know a the- the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we hadn't did it ourself	2079	A
yeah i mean it's not a Eldorado house or anything like that but you know it's ours	2079	A
that's right that's right	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
apparently- apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high isn't it it really is	2079	A
because_1 i i'm always shocked at about you know what they've got- have it appraised at i think oh my goodness	2079	A
<silence>	2079	A
okay and it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye	2079	A
	2079	A
<silence>	2079	B
okay we um i'm presently living in a house uh first time uh	2079	B
we had the house built and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess and uh	2079	B
um it was a really excitement to uh	2079	B
	2079	B
to go out and select a house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses	2079	B
and um as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in Dallas Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home	2079	B
and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart	2079	B
so i would um	2079	B
not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in uh because they're overpriced	2079	B
um but they're a cheap house if you can't afford something good you know they're good for that and um you can call it a home because_1 it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting	2079	B
uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it	2079	B
 how about in your case	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
um-hum	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
um-hum	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
well that's great that's great that's uh i've heard i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh	2079	B
who had a house built matter of fact another guy's building one now he's been doing it for three years and the city's a little upset with him but i understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that and uh	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
nothing wrong with that uh i'll vouch for that	2079	B
um	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
that was a big savings	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
well that's great well- have you been in it long	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
oh really well have you do you have any plans to uh maybe um expand or move onward	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
 i see well	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
first one's always a bear	2079	B
we're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us and uh that can basically be be be put on any lot in any state any country- you know so that's kind of the	2079	B
we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and he's charging about a buck a square foot to design it and he's registered- certified and registered so at least we know we're it's not gonna fall in or something if it's built but uh i have heard	2079	B
that your approach is is is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you don't wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and and that's kind of the plan i have so um uh everyone i talk to uh i've	2079	B
i file in my little book and do other things with it uh that's great that's great	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
sure i can imagine	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
if your happy with it that's all that counts	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
that's only- only uh you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
ooh and that's uh that's uh a a encouraging sign if you ever wanna resell it i guess	2079	B
<silence>	2079	B
a lot of money i bet well that's great well yeah i guess that about does it	2079	B
nice talking with you too bye	2079	B
	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
no i haven't been camping since i was about sixteen	2009	A
but uh my family used to have a pop-up trailer and we'd go camping to a lot of different places we spent two weeks in Bastrop Texas once	2009	A
it's near Austin	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
um-hum	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A

	2009	A
i'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with nothing	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
God	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer they're both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they go to New Mexico	2009	A
and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and	2009	A
doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went uh she just got tired of the tent and it was cold at night and she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night	2009	A
just for fun	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
no kidding no kidding gosh that's what the the the bugs i don't like the bugs	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
yeah the one good- nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they had a big hammock and they would always find a couple of a campsite with a couple of good trees to hang it in between and i could just lay in that hammock for hours	2009	A
yeah	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
oh	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
hum	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and it was just horrible and the sand was blowing up our camp the little camping area was pretty near the shore	2009	A
and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and couldn't even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because you'd get sand in your eyes	2009	A
yeah it was pretty bad	2009	A
yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usually- we usually took box games and things to do in case it rained and they my parents always let us take a couple of friends so we always had a good time	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A
yeah	2009	A
yeah and	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A

my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home	2009	A
mainly because he's a football he's a college football coach and we're gonna have to travel a lot	2009	A
and it'd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without spending big money for a hotel and and park it outside of the stadium and have a good ole time	2009	A
um-hum	2009	A
that is nice	2009	A
<silence>	2009	A

we had a lot of fun	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
yes	2009	B
me too	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
oh no no i've done it but it's not fun you don't want to do it for like three weeks at a time that's for sure	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
ooh no no	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
oh yeah	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
	2009	B
 shaking the scorpions out of their shoes	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
oh me neither me neither the- the -mosquitoes just keep you up all night	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
yeah	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
yeah that- that's nice	2009	B
 when my family- when my family camps we're the the only time you're at the camper is when you want to sleep otherwise you're just going constantly you know in all the in all the National Parks and stuff	2009	B
we camped at the let's see we camped down at at Galveston two or three years ago and that that was that was fun except that they uh were having a lot of problems with dead fish on the shore and they were	2009	B
and the and the smell of that was kind of gross but	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
oh how awful	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
um-hum oh yeah	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
oh that's miserable	2009	B
yeah i had-	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
yeah	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
yeah it's it's- you- it's you- you always when you when there's kids you've always got to have other stuff to do because_1 it's always gonna rain sometime and then your parents- parents- they drive the parents nuts	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
oh i know i wish i'd appreciated- i wish i'd appreciated it more you- uh when i was when we were camping so extensively you- when we- when we were younger	2009	B
now i wish i could go back to those places yeah the time and i've got got a child and another one on the way so i wish i had time my my- our pop-up camper just sits in the garage and collects dust unfortunately	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
uh-huh	2009	B
yeah	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
yeah	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
that's true	2009	B
<silence>	2009	B
plus it's nice to have your own stuff there yeah plus you get eating out is expensive- is so expensive and	2009	B
so it it it it's a it can be really handy to have a camper just	2009	B
because_1 my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we take our pop-up with us in good weather and stay overnight at a state park or something so we don't have to rent a hotel room and that's	2009	B
that's nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty	2009	B
yeah well	2009	B
what else	2009	B
	2009	B
well	2009	B
i think that's just pretty much it we've been on here awhile	2009	B
well it's been nice talking to you	2009	B
	2009	B
bye-bye	2009	B
	2009	B
okay	2065	B
i think it would be a great idea i'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because_1 people are going you know feeling resentful i don't know but i think it would be a great idea	2065	B
seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
um-hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
oh really uh	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
um-hum um	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and	2065	B
but i don't know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe- maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to	2065	B
really you know	2065	B
send children you know to do that	2065	B
i didn't know	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea	2065	B
i sent off for stuff on it but i don't remember that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
you actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps it wasn't much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered	2065	B
yeah i think so yeah yeah	2065	B
	2065	B
	2065	B
really yeah i hadn't thought about that um-hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
public hangings and yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
yeah i've heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered them you know on the you know street so yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
 yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah that's true	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that	2065	B
might not go if it was voluntary but i don't know how they'd enforce it if it was	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
um-hum	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it's in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the	2065	B
things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too	2065	B
i don't know	2065	B
 i'd like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
um-hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
um-hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
um-hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it wasn't people that were really fair and	2065	B
leaving it you know in a legal way or something they could send all the people over to you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported or	2065	B
it would be open for	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah that could be a complicated too couldn't it yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah that's true unfair or something yeah yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
	2065	B
 yeah really	2065	B
yeah well it seems like there's there's a a lot of you don't hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that but you know i'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have	2065	B
good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh	2065	B
the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a i guess now she's practically a teenager	2065	B
she started some type of um national um organization for youth to volunteer like to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards	2065	B
 you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in Dallas there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um	2065	B
 minority you know um i think it was in a Hispanic area they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said every- all these gangs kids could join to belong	2065	B
but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if there's people out there that are	2065	B
willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them_1 you know	2065	B
if their willing to do it	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
um-hum	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
huh	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
oh i see	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah yeah	2065	B
well we um we belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is like the nickname the Mormon church	2065	B
and um the there is men and also women women aren't	2065	B
um nearly as frequent and also that have uh elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission	2065	B
and um they're all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah and they have to be taught the language and	2065	B
customs and all those kinds of things and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
 right	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
oh he had a direct connection somewhere uh	2065	B
 yeah	2065	B
<silence>	2065	B
yeah but see they don't get paid for it and um but there is funding that that comes they're supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them_1 out some but	2065	B
but you know that it is incredible	2065	B
you- you know	2065	B
 yeah it's	2065	B
very involved	2065	B
okay the question was um what what is your opinion of youth uh spending a year or two in in public service	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local	2065	A
uh my only experience with it i was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador for instance everybody had what they called there social year	2065	A
that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education	2065	A
and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally i just there was very little external i think	2065	A
possibly what uh they're thinking about here more external Peace Corps type things where we're sending people off shore	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah i don't i don't know how the Peace Corps works i guess i was of age when the Peace Corps came in and all that	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
did you ever get any information on it like	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
that's that's what i was wondering about was whether they actually	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah was it	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps or some such thing	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
where they couldn't do that yeah you might end up with a revolution i don't know which end though yeah	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah yeah that's that's been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know	2065	A
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them_1 would actually say hey that's not a bad way to do it because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime	2065	A
uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and	2065	A
in public- yeah and this sort of thing you know so you don't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah well i guess that's uh the price of freedom i guess is a little anyway the uh uh the the public service thing again i- i- i	2065	A
i guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought here uh	2065	A
i- i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary but when you do that then it becomes almost uh	2065	A
 or it can be	2065	A
you know there are people will kind of set up their own little club	2065	A
 and uh but if	2065	A
you know if you start	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah well if they went AWOL what are you going to do shoot them_1 put them_1 in jail	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
yeah yeah right	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
i know my dad always talked about uh he was in uh CCC during uh the depression and he was uh a rock rib Iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the	2065	A
the whole Roosevelt administration was uh civilian conservation corps he because_1 he was in it he thought that was great the rest of it was all hog wash but the that was great	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
yeah the only	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do	2065	A
you know if uh	2065	A
you know if it's run by the individual state you know like CCC was run by the army and in effect	2065	A
and the only opposition to it really was that it was you know starting- starting some sort of a military elitist type	2065	A
you know special corps of uh cadre of people that sort of thing and uh when the politics of it get real confusing	2065	A
uh	2065	A
um-hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
 yeah well we've we've gotten to the point where you know if if if well	2065	A
if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing	2065	A
oh yeah suppose uh	2065	A
well you know they they had a group of people who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh can't think of a good example a swimming pool or anything	2065	A
you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didn't build one over here	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
yeah i think uh	2065	A
	2065	A
oh boy	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
it's one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea it's like a	2065	A
joke i heard once about uh	2065	A
elephant foot soup you know it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot	2065	A
it's it's uh it's the logistics of the thing that uh that that gets you going	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
yeah it's it's it's just the you know here you to the logistics of the thing again you know who	2065	A
who's going to run it you know what how oh it's just so many	2065	A
yeah well like like i said at the beginning i've got so many connections with people in Central America my daughter-in-law is Panamanian you know and they have situations like like that down there where they	2065	A
they have these the social	2065	A
in some sort of way if you want to go to school outside the country and many Salvadorians did they'd go to school in Cornell Iowa of all places	2065	A
and when they came back they'd have to serve this this this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones i knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they didn't do anything	2065	A
and they had all kinds of uh things they could go into agricultural and you know really you know good stuff but uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that Red Cross	2065	A
it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your chance of having to do something was very slim- it was very slim and so	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum um-hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
okay then that's uh kind of a private	2065	A
organization- you know i'm i'm familiar with my instructor pilot was a	2065	A
was a Mormon he was because_1 he was a good construction uh you know instructor- instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible	2065	A
yeah yeah right he felt that he really had an in so you know he things he would do with an airplane but any rate that's off the subject no i haven't seen- i haven't seen	2065	A
you know	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
um-hum	2065	A
<silence>	2065	A
i seen how they were organized in in central and South America and uh yeah it's uh	2065	A
	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
okay uh	2080	A
well yeah i like to do a little remodeling work and in older homes and stuff i just bought a home two years ago that's about sixty five years old and we've done a little work on it	2080	A
and uh about_1	2080	A
pardon me	2080	A
timber framing okay well	2080	A
other than you talking about like post and beam construction that type well not very much other than what i read we don't use much of that up here although i understand they do in the Southwest quite a bit	2080	A
but um	2080	A
up here we generally use uh uh frame construction work or wood frame construction with wooden siding and and you know most of your homes down south i guess are brick	2080	A
but here they're pretty much wood frame construction on a two by four's and and uh one by twelve boarding on the outside or sheet plywood	2080	A
and then some kind of a insulation material and covered with clapboards or shingles	2080	A
that's a typical New England home i guess	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
ah	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
sure	2080	A
um-hum	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
oh okay that's unique we do a lot of truss roofs up here but they are they're again they're	2080	A
they're truss construction but they're well braced you know cross braced inside held together by steel cleats and stuff	2080	A
uh mansard roofs are are in bond building i guess are	2080	A
they do a lot of that	2080	A
i understand by laminating the series of of beams of planks together and and with	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
um-hum	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
well that's something	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
sure sure something like the way you'd do uh um bricks around a window around a large window type thing the center the center brick is the key brick which locks everything together that's a pretty neat idea	2080	A
you building are you are you-	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
uh-huh	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
okay	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
where are you located	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
okay	2080	A
yeah okay i lived in Abilene for about ten years	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
oh yeah a little bit	2080	A
it gets a little dusty there Lubbock blows by there about once a month if i remember	2080	A
i worked for the TI plant in Abilene and and i sure enjoyed the Southwest it was really neat	2080	A
but uh that that's an interesting concept that is this going to be your your permanent home or okay	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
i saw a log cabin built down there that i was really impressed with and it sounds like it's similar to the open construction that you're going to have where the only thing enclosed upstairs were the bedrooms	2080	A
but the rest of the center portion of the cabin which was a huge huge house was all open and the thing i really liked about it was it had a porch on all four sides of the house	2080	A
all the way around the house	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
uh-huh	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
yeah yeah	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
uh-huh	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
wow boy that's quite a distance	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
yeah yeah i have a a pretty good idea where it is of course i know Wichita Falls pretty well	2080	A
pardon me	2080	A
yeah	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
uh-huh well that's really interesting	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
yeah well out out that way it shouldn't be to bad i guess your traffic doesn't get too heavy till you head in toward uh toward Dallas a little bit but you should spread out pretty good out there i know	2080	A
yeah out in West Texas there was hardly any at all in Abilene but	2080	A
uh well with that's a little different here in New England we sure got some around Boston here and New York i'll tell you but	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
oh	2080	A
oh okay yeah well i live about i live just over the line of south of Attleboro Massachusetts into Rhode Island	2080	A
and it's just north of the City of Providence	2080	A
	2080	A
but it moves pretty well so	2080	A
well boy it's sure been nice talking with you and uh uh hopefully we'll have another conversation probably another way down the road good luck with your new home	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
is that right	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
okay and and	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
sure	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
uh-huh	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
you going to take advantage of the uh the ground thermal action and and and and uh use that for your heat and cooling	2080	A
for cooling especially yeah yeah yeah well your winters get a little cold down there sometimes but	2080	A
yeah that's for sure uh well we're still in our winter up here right now the temperature is eighteen degrees	2080	A
	2080	A
yeah huh i can stand that	2080	A
yeah well it's been cold up here the mornings have been cold the winds blowing about forty miles an hour right now so it's really really cold outside	2080	A
we've been real fortunate we haven't had much snow and stuff so	2080	A
	2080	A
is that right	2080	A
yeah that's but that's a little too much though then a lot of folks catch colds and stuff that you know	2080	A
the the temperature change is too drastic like that it should come a little more gradual i think	2080	A
<silence>	2080	A
yeah yeah i i hear you	2080	A
okay sir	2080	A
it yeah yeah thank you much i will talk to you again bye-bye	2080	A
	2080	A
	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
so you're a woodworker uh	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
what do you know about timber framing	2080	B
what do you know about timber framing	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
right right	2080	B
uh-huh	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah the reason i asked is because	2080	B
we're embarking on a little adventure here	2080	B
in that we're going to use uh some timber framing techniques to build a	2080	B
a truss for a home	2080	B
and it's a it's a you know what a mansard roof is	2080	B
like a barn yeah	2080	B
and they're mansard trusses that don't have any internal bracing	2080	B
so the whole area is like a cathedral up there	2080	B
for the second floor	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
right	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
um-hum	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah that that's done some where they're actually create a a single piece that is the trust	2080	B
but uh what i want to do is i want to make four identical components	2080	B
and uh cut the joints so that the	2080	B
the more pressure you put on it the stronger it gets	2080	B
and it involves interleaving and uh using uh you know locking wedges	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah similar to that yeah	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
well if i do that and then cover it with uh two by six tongue and groove	2080	B
it will be pretty sturdy because we have to we we got what we call Santa Ana wind down here	2080	B
it comes up out of Mexico at about a hundred miles an hour	2080	B
we're at a the corner- at the Northwest of Denton Texas	2080	B
right on the Red River	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah well then you know about that wind	2080	B
	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah yeah we we bought this land out here we're going to we're going to retire on it	2080	B
maybe in twenty five thirty years from now but	2080	B
you know we're we're still fairly young	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
well we're only going to have a porch on north and south end	2080	B
and uh we'll have some- uh Anderson window walls is what they are	2080	B
so the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass	2080	B
because_1 on the piece of property we have it's the second highest pointed in the county	2080	B
and we can see Oklahoma to the north the lights of Gainesville to the east and the lights of Wichita Falls to the west	2080	B
and that's a and it's it's a we're just right on the southern rim of the Red River Valley	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
well you know where Nocona is	2080	B
Nocona	2080	B
okay that's about as far north as we can see just you know right on the other side of the river there	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
and boy it's really nice it's about an hour drive to work though	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
we don't have any traffic	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
	2080	B
yeah	2080	B
well i used to live in uh Springfield well actually Chicopee Falls	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
that's unbelievable	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah it will be a lot of fun we're digging the foundation by hand	2080	B
yeah the first floor's going to be underground	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
and it of course it will be open on the south and north end	2080	B
and east and well see we have a little knoll on our property about thirty feet tall and it's almost straight up so we'll nestle the house right up next to it	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
right	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
cooling we don't have to worry about heat i mean	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
yeah but they're very short	2080	B
	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
well the temperature Tuesday was ninety six	2080	B
it was tough today it was cold in the seventies	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
it went from thirty eight to ninety six on Tuesday that's a pretty good temperature swing	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
well if you don't like the weather in Texas just wait a minute	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
well you have a good day	2080	B
<silence>	2080	B
all righty	2080	B
	2080	B
	2007	A
well what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah i i i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then there's like you say there's industry	2007	A
with all the uh sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere	2007	A
causing acid rain and everything else	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
hm	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
ozone yeah ozone- ozone pollution yeah	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
well i was i was thinking about that too i mean uh we don't have any suitable replacement for Freon and you- and you have to have it for refrigeration so	2007	A
but on the other hand you know i i've	2007	A
um i took a boat cruise one time and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane	2007	A
it- it was actually powered by a flame	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah uh it it something with heat i don't understand the mechanics of it but uh	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
oh okay so it still had Freon in it	2007	A
oh okay i well like-	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah	2007	A
yeah	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
right which happens all the time when they go to service the things	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah escape	2007	A
sure yeah yeah i	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
hm well that makes sense	2007	A
i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i i think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and	2007	A
all that kind of stuff uh cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain problem	2007	A
but the ozone i mean you know we can't replace that	2007	A
we we can't clean it up	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
burning and everything else	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah	2007	A
yeah yeah that's right when i was a kid i used to do the same thing it's uh	2007	A
i- i don't know- i don't know what the rain forests have to do with it but you know they're chopping those down at a tremendous rate everyday	2007	A
	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
i don't know this uh	2007	A
ozone	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
 yes	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
naw i can believe it	2007	A
you- you probably- you probably did less harm than what the water would have done though	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
gosh	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
gosh- well it's	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah right the	2007	A
the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff	2007	A
	2007	A
jeez well that's scary	2007	A
i it it worries me to turn on the turn on the taps now because_1 you never know what's gonna come out	2007	A
you know- and i and i don't- i don't really trust these these government agencies that test this stuff i really don't	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah well it's it's like so many other- it's like chicken you know they go in there and they supposedly inspect this chicken	2007	A
i don't know if you ever saw that 60 Minutes thing where they showed a chicken processing plant	2007	A
yeah i i haven't touched chicken since	2007	A
yeah i i couldn't i couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing that	2007	A
and but the government says it's safe uh-huh	2007	A
right that's about what they say about the the air pollution in this country	2007	A
and they say- say- -yeah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn around and you look and places like Los Angeles is still- still so thick you have to cut it with a knife	2007	A
i don't know	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
just about yeah	2007	A
yeah um i don't know you know used to be a lot of states had uh	2007	A
uh you had to have your car checked for pollution every year you had to have that little sticker in the window i know Texas does	2007	A
and there are about three places in Georgia that does	2007	A
and i think Louisiana does i'm not sure but i there's not very many of them_1 around anymore	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah they don't do it anymore	2007	A
yeah	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
i think that's the problem with most of it the politicians finally did away with it because_1 the people were so mad about having to pay that fee and-	2007	A
yeah and- and i mean all it was was a revenue generator	2007	A
it- it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve	2007	A
i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at these things belching huge blue clouds of oil smoke	2007	A
	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
	2007	A
oh yeah oh those are	2007	A
yeah i mean- you know what was it back in the uh late seventies when diesel engines were the thing	2007	A
because it was uh so much cheaper than gas now you look diesel's	2007	A
what one forty one fifty a gallon while gas is one- you know one oh five	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
i never did like diesels anyway they they were too cantankerous	2007	A
cold weather-	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um	2007	A
yeah i had a friend of mine had a uh had a Buick had had a diesel in it and he had nothing but trouble with the thing	2007	A
yeah winter time the the diesel would gel and it wouldn't	2007	A
i don't know liquefy right and then his injector things got clogged and oh God-	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
um-hum	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
that that may that yeah that may have been what he had um	2007	A
but speaking of cars what more can we do to cars to make them_1 less polluting	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
yeah	2007	A
<silence>	2007	A
i'm just wondering about the feasibility of electric cars	2007	A
i saw an article in the paper-	2007	A
	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
well i guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing contributes uh quite a bit to air pollution	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
uh yeah- yeah you know i'm wondering uh course uh Freon is uh is uh eating away at our	2007	B
uh what you call that layer there ozone layer	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in propane- in place of Freon	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
uh well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat	2007	B
be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the ship that you said	2007	B
uh you had and uh somehow created- heat must be created that Freon	2007	B
oh i'm not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and	2007	B
in the process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes frozen- cold- uh ice cold	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
oh yes yes Freon's uh Freon is in a closed circuit	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
uh that's why our present day refrigerants uh systems are not dangerous unless the lines are broken	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
well- well did you ever see what happens when they uh replace the or replenish the Freon in your automobile air conditioner	2007	B
i mean there's uh a lot of it is uh turned out into the atmosphere	2007	B
and i understand now uh i don't know if it's international or just here in Texas or what but uh	2007	B
service stations are going to require to have a special device	2007	B
to catch this Freon as it is expelled- expelled the excess Freon	2007	B
and therefore you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to or you wouldn't even be able to do it yourself at home	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
no that's true	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
you know i can remember as a child uh	2007	B
spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a bathing suit	2007	B
no shoes socks shirts or anything	2007	B
uh i mean from dawn till dusk	2007	B
and i develop a nice tan but uh my gosh it never had to worry about uh skin cancer	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and and get a drink of water without worrying about-	2007	B
about_1 catching some disease	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
hm yeah yeah	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
i tell you funny thing happened to me with with polluted water	2007	B
uh TI sent me up on a trip to Wyoming i think it was and i was out in this little	2007	B
town kind of backwoods town you know uh where big night on the town is going down watching the traffic light change	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
but uh i checked into a motel	2007	B
and after i signed in and everything why the uh clerk told me uh don't drink the water	2007	B
it's contaminated	2007	B
he said now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests but unfortunately we're out of it right now but as as soon as we get it	2007	B
i'll- i'll see that you get a bottle of it	2007	B
well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and would you believe it i brushed my teeth with Coca-Cola	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
oh well they- they had this uh	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
it's uh some kind of a bacteria called- or carried by animals	2007	B
and it they got their water from this uh beautiful mountain river	2007	B
well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream	2007	B
but this uh bacteria had uh penetrated their entire	2007	B
pipe system or water system	2007	B
and they tried flushing it out they they couldn't get rid of it	2007	B
i've often wondered now this is years ago and i've often wondered what they ever did course the oh was a beautiful mountain stream	2007	B
bubbling nicely you know the which uh is what purifies water when it bubbles	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
yes and yet even at that it was still contaminated	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
well i'm beginning to wonder too i mean you get- you're always hearing stories about well the government okayed this	2007	B
then all of a sudden you turn around and	2007	B
my gosh it's okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around and do it that way it's dangerous	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
as a matter of fact i did	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
neither have i	2007	B
	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
uh yeah	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
i've often wondered about the LA now that's supposed to be about the worst city- city in the country i guess for	2007	B
air pollution	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
uh yeah um-hum	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
well	2007	B
uh they used to do it down in Florida now i lived down there for ten years	2007	B
no they did away with it because they found out that uh	2007	B
the people that were doing it it was just a racket to them	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
and for nothing- uh for nothing too	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
yeah	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
um-hum well now here's another thing diesels	2007	B
uh diesel engines are uh the worst	2007	B
and yet they haven't done a thing to them	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
uh-huh yeah tell- tell- tell me about it i just got rid of a a diesel engine Escort	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
well i um i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
is that right well	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
uh-huh well now there was at one time	2007	B
as a matter of fact it may have been Buick i think because_1 i think it was GM that came out with a	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
 diesel uh diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine	2007	B
and uh they used the same pistons and and cylinders and whatnot but all they did was change the uh	2007	B
uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over	2007	B
and although they were it seemed practical at the time they were nothing but a headache	2007	B
and they did away- went- to- went- finally did away with them_1 and went to a straight diesel	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
well now course in California they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere	2007	B
now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in California	2007	B
i don't know what it is precisely but uh they're doing they do something	2007	B
a little more stricter than we do	2007	B
<silence>	2007	B
	2006	B
{alrighty} uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution	2006	B
as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us	2006	B
um	2006	B
	2006	B
does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
um-hum	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
very	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
yeah it's uh having uh uh well- well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the Sherman deal is uh uh uh	2006	B
 lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um is we have the Texas Air Control Board TACB that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to	2006	B
and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the TACB which is located in Austin in writing and hey look what we've done here at TI	2006	B
and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um	2006	B
uh this is air side allow- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage it's in in in tons per year um	2006	B
and so what- what- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems	2006	B
uh that uh scrub out the NOX and uh VOCs and and the ammonia compounds uh like- all the acids	2006	B
uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts	2006	B
and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto	2006	B
as you know the they're allowed to come on site the {federaldes} anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
the Sherman facility we are still in the	2006	B
closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's been pitched to the Sherman uh City Council with uh open arms as well as the public we had open forum and and uh	2006	B
uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project	2006	B
and uh it's real uh going real well i think it's matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it	2006	B
uh but it's uh it's something else yeah that- they're in the same issue we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh	2006	B
because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it won't have uh any uh	2006	B
any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend of- of- of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh	2006	B
uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh	2006	B
it's an interesting job but um	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
possibly	2006	B
hm	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
uh i'm familiar with that one	2006	B
we uh we have stuff that's very interesting yeah	2006	B
we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it	2006	B
and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground	2006	B
but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab	2006	B
which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we're uh very very uh {cognizitive} and aware of all these type of uh	2006	B
expenditures because_1 it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would	2006	B
um	2006	B
	2006	B
i've enjoyed speaking with you	2006	B
this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building yeah	2006	B
so uh i hope you like your office	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
yeah	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything and uh is uh y'all were- y'all the only ones that make any money for TI here in the last two years	2006	B
	2006	B
 so-	2006	B
<silence>	2006	B
exactly and that's um when you start making- when you start paying your wages you know Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys	2006	B
i've enjoyed- exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you see you later bye-bye	2006	B
	2006	B
<silence>	2006	A
right	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
me i'm in the legal department and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues	2006	A
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that TI has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a	2006	A
a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such	2006	A
but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants	2006	A
from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have	2006	A
uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
oh okay	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
oh	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
uh-huh	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
um-hum	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
uh-huh	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
okay_1	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
um-hum	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
hm	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
hm	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
hm	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
um-hum	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A

<silence>	2006	A
right	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and	2006	A
you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not	2006	A
uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've uh gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up that's you know mega bucks to uh	2006	A
you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um	2006	A
certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground because_1 eventually you know it- it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area	2006	A
it still only in time starts to leak out	2006	A
yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again	2006	A
 jeez	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
um-hum	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
um-hum	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
hm	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
um-hum	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
yeah	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
oh you were oh okay	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
yes	2006	A
yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean we- we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know TI that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those in ten fifteen years	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
 we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center before	2006	A
	2006	A
<silence>	2006	A
right right not just overhead	2006	A
you too bye	2006	A
	2006	A
well i haven't uh i've been working in my own home for just um	2050	B
about the last three years but- so i can just wear whatever i want around the house but before then i taught- taught at the University of Houston and um	2050	B
so i tried to wear things that were	2050	B
comfortable but still tried to look you know	2050	B
yes but- it wasn't quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or tattered clothes that i didn't have as good control over the class	2050	B
and if i tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
uh-huh	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
oh that's nice	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
well do you um	2050	B
meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
well i uh i have noticed with my own children for example that they will depending on what they're wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act and so that could be the same can be said for the business office too	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that since a lot of the people were my own age or older even um	2050	B
that because i taught English as a second language so i didn't have your average freshman student and um so i	2050	B
i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you don't quite want to be their equal	2050	B
and so for me to dress in uh in businesslike um clothes my you know i i preferred slacks because we had to walk- park pretty far away from	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
yes and you wouldn't want to have to walk uh you know in high heels it's hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large	2050	B
so i preferred slacks and um you know	2050	B
kind of dressy shirts and things but	2050	B
so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and that helped with their discipline and	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
didn't make me have um to much trouble and	2050	B
 with the students	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to	2050	B
totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and	2050	B
and	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
no and you don't um you know if you usually can wear pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater	2050	B
or something rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe with	2050	B
different shoes you know we always had like um	2050	B
higher	2050	B
higher shoes higher tops on them_1 rather than just um the lower	2050	B
skimmers- skimmers i think they call them_1 that you would wear day-to-day but	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
that's really true a lot of it is um	2050	B
the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable	2050	B
you know if you wear um pastels it's needs to be warm weather	2050	B
and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and	2050	B
i guess part of that is um	2050	B
just the physics of it that in what isn't it dark colors attract the sun and light colors repel repel them so	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
that's true there's some rule that's like between Labor Day uh no is it Labor Day or Memorial Day	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
uh-huh right and the one that's like in May you can only wear and and supposedly we don't have an opportunity my husband and i we don't go to a lot of like where you have to wear	2050	B
	2050	B
holidays too that's pretty funny it's funny that we have as a society	2050	B
go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
yes	2050	B
i noticed uh when we moved to Plano that um the mall here Collin Creek Mall i don't know where you are but um	2050	B
oh you do that there there is a pretty um	2050	B
i wouldn't say snobbish but it it's kind of borders on that that if i depending on what i'm wearing i get better service at the mall i felt since	2050	B
uh where you know from where i've lived in Houston that you have to in order to get	2050	B
the attention you might need help	2050	B
you need to be you can't just come in off the street is what i'm trying to say	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
oh is it	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
um-hum	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
yes i think i think your right i've noticed that too it's just it's very different but i've	2050	B
i think um it's kind of sad when you have to	2050	B
go in and make dress up to go somewhere i mean just to the shop	2050	B
	2050	B
yeah and you have to be sure that your everything coordinates and everything everything is um freshly pressed and everything	2050	B
 no	2050	B
you can't just drop in well i appreciate um the conversation we've had about clothing i know i've it's interesting to hear a man's point of view it's usually my husband	2050	B
he's got a pretty good deal i go out and buy all his clothes and they magically	2050	B
<silence>	2050	B
well thank you and you have a good day okay bye-bye	2050	B
	2050	B
<silence>	2050	A
oh now that's nice yeah	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
somewhat business attire yeah	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
exactly well i i work uh i'm a financial analyst and uh uh	2050	A
in my group uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie uh but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and we can wear like uh an open collar or uh	2050	A
a lot of times in the summer i'll try to uh like on a Friday i'll try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf	2050	A
so uh i'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh um and that that's okay that's appropriate	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
not really it's uh it's just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president and uh the senior vice president is uh	2050	A
is big on business attire and so um um he sort of funnels that down to uh	2050	A
to the people that work in his group so um i i i enjoy it i think it uh it makes a nice environment and uh i don't know gives it a little more business type uh atmosphere	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
see i think that's exactly right you know if if you're uh if you're dressed in a uh a suit and uh	2050	A
to me it make- it helps me feel uh sort of like you were saying a lot more confident in myself	2050	A
and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the vice president i feel i just have that little- little extra confidence in myself being dressed that way	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
oh i see	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
exactly	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
oh Lord and down in Houston it'd be so hot yeah	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
i see	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
i see	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
and i think clothing you know it- it just uh	2050	A
it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so you- you sort of dress down but if you're going to a uh	2050	A
a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
i see	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
i'm i'm sure that's true yeah	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
yeah see the winter season's just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in in uh	2050	A
in the the heavier heavier materials	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
exactly exactly	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than than men's clothing	2050	A
because_1 uh men or at least in my situation you can uh i can wear the same slacks and uh sports coats nearly- nearly all year round	2050	A
and uh ladies you know uh uh i don't know if that's marketing or what but they they definitely have a uh i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
true	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
exactly	2050	A
plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and and uh i know in our office uh our secretary gives everyone a hard- all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think it's	2050	A
uh is it after uh Labor Day or something i don't know and and uh so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with uh i think the way we dress	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
i'm not for sure it's that one in September is when you need to quit	2050	A
yeah	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
i see right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
exactly exactly	2050	A
	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
exactly- a lot more uh that's right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh spending time and effort on rather than our appearance	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
i live here in Plano yeah	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
oh really	2050	A
huh	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
yeah	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
exactly and i think that's you know a North Dallas type attitude	2050	A
and uh because_1 i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church	2050	A
and uh	2050	A
i don't know that's that's uh because_1 i i went to school with- at uh Texas Tech in Lubbock	2050	A
and uh church was a a lot more casual uh rather than uh you know here it's like going to a fashion show almost	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right to try to keep up with the Jones almost yeah	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
you can't just wear your sweats and an old T-shirt and	2050	A
	2050	A
right	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A
	2050	A
well now that is that is so uh well that is great i appreciate the call	2050	A
<silence>	2050	A

<silence>	2035	A
the one we went in had um the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area that really seemed- i mean they really seemed to go wild in there	2035	A
<silence>	2035	A

during the day you know it's all devoted to our kids and they come go to church with us and-	2035	B

uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news	2060	B
and uh for me that's uh mostly newspaper and radio i almost never watch television	2060	B
as a matter of course so i don't get news from television except during the war i watched a lot of CNN because it was so good	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
um	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
yeah	2060	B
um	2060	B
i don't know i guess uh i don't even know why i watch CNN i guess i just wanted more news it's one of the few times i wanted	2060	B
more news than	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
CBS	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B

<silence>	2060	B
um-hum	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
right	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably	2060	B
don't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made	2060	B
but uh i can- i'm from California and i can remember being in	2060	B
uh in these earthquakes and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed	2060	B
you know from anyone else's point of view but they'd get all blown up in the news	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
uh	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
um-hum	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B

<silence>	2060	B
no i don't i work for North Carolina State University	2060	B

<silence>	2060	B
well	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
let's see i've i've i've never done this before i mean i've never	2060	B
this is my first call because_1 i just got my password	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
so i don't know are we suppose to it seems to me it says you're supposed to talk for three minutes but i think we've been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
i see	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
uh-huh	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
well all right nice talking to you	2060	B
all right bye	2060	B
<silence>	2060	B
	2060	A
okay	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
uh-huh	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
uh-huh	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
well why was CNN the only- of course i think Saddam Hussein only allowed CNN to broadcast it is that not true	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
yeah	2060	A
well i know even if you watched ABC NBC or or the other you- i mean what's the other one uh CBS they all were were tapped into CNN	2060	A
uh-huh that's the only thing they broadcast and- like you i listen to the radio on my job at work and all this week they've been having this uh	2060	A
a discussion about that is why uh why CNN was	2060	A
well i listen to a Christian radio station and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world uh news service and uh	2060	A
that was you can't really be sure of the quality of what you got you know	2060	A
uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing	2060	A
and i was watching on TV they they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem so we got all fearful	2060	A
for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it	2060	A
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know about- you know uh if the news we're getting is any good	2060	A
so	2060	A
	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
yeah	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
right right	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
yeah	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
uh-huh	2060	A
	2060	A
well i it i find it depressing to watch or especially TV you know it's uh local news	2060	A
concentrates on murders and things like that i'm from Dallas	2060	A
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff it just really gets me depressed even to watch it	2060	A
so then you wake up one morning and you're in war with somebody you don't even know about it	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
so	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
uh we have the Dallas Times Herald and the Dallas Morning News but i don't	2060	A
i don't read newspapers	2060	A
huh-uh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another it's just something i've never developed uh an interest in	2060	A
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered	2060	A
	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
you'd be surprised	2060	A
they just come by and pick them_1 up even if it's just for the TV you know uh	2060	A
selections of the day i don't know it just wouldn't be there whenever i've tried it	2060	A
so you're right who would steal a newspaper	2060	A
but they do	2060	A
what part of California are you from	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
oh okay	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
huh you work for TI	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
huh	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
yeah	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
well i boy current events is not a good subject for me	2060	A
i don't keep up with it that often	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
this is your first call	2060	A
uh-huh	2060	A
oh really	2060	A
<silence>	2060	A
yeah well i'd i got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten minutes	2060	A
	2060	A
	2060	A
all right do you have any kids	2056	A
i've got two and it is hard to find day care for them_1	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
oh	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
well i i've seen the bad side in most of them_1	2056	A
i took my son to a day care one time when he was just- you know just uh not even three months old and uh you know it was a desperate thing	2056	A
and uh when my husband went to pick him up she he said that the baby had been crying the whole time he was asleep but you know how they cry in their sleep	2056	A
and uh you know this uh couldn't catch his breath even in his sleep and that turned me off of day cares	2056	A
and then when i took uh	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
i've seen these kids that uh	2056	A
it's a church volleyball they have a day care set up there for people playing volleyball and uh one of the girls was real mean to the kid	2056	A
and that was you know he she'd just she had treated him like family does you know and um	2056	A
it you know it uh i know most of the girls up there and the ones that keeps my kids are real good uh my son doesn't like people too much	2056	A
but uh when when we leave there he uh gives the girl a hug and tells her i'll miss you so you know	2056	A
so i know they treat him good	2056	A
uh	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
yeah yeah uh i don't know much about day cares itself you know uh you know this is more of just the nursery for three and under	2056	A
and uh there's only there's two people taking care of about five kids uh where i'm where i'm taking my two	2056	A
and but uh in most places yeah they got forty five kids at best i guess	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
you know and maybe about four teachers and that's a lot of kids	2056	A
uh	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
no there's not nobody can take care of your kids better than you	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
well i had to quit my job because of uh my- my two you know uh day care wise or {babysittingwise} and stuff	2056	A
uh because_1 you know my sister was keeping them_1 uh uh we just lucked out and she uh met a military man who lived down here and we came down here for TI	2056	A
and uh so i had her baby sitting but she was six months pregnant and it was getting too much for her so i just quit i'd rather quit and take care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
well you know they're getting raised right	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
yeah	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
yeah if um	2056	A
i i know one church that uh there was some problems with but that was just uh basically a personal problem between the mother and the uh person that was taking- in charge	2056	A
but uh	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
the church uh day care that my kids uh they don't go to a day care you know it's uh during Sunday School and stuff uh the people there are really nice	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
yeah well they	2056	A
i think it's one of the important things	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
if uh because_1 if they don't like it uh you can't get them_1 that separation thing and i need that my kids i need to cut the strings on them_1 they're not very old but	2056	A
three and uh four and two	2056	A
so you know they're they're good kids you know they do bad things but they're good kids	2056	A
 yeah uh but	2056	A
i don't like the punishment the day care does you know i don't know exactly what they do but i don't want no one punishing my kids but myself	2056	A
and that's another problem with day care because you're not there so you don't what they're doing	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
and if	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
yeah that's that's that's something that should be brought up with these people	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
i don't know if they do it either to be truthful	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
well uh	2056	A
with me i just decided not to face it and you know in most in in so many words you know in one way or the other i just decided not to face that issue and i just keep them_1 with me	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
	2056	A
yeah so have i oh	2056	A
<silence>	2056	A
oh well thanks and i guess i we've- we've been on long enough so you have a good day all right bye-bye	2056	A
	2056	A
okay	2056	B
no	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
what um what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
what would you like to see in one	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
uh-huh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
i bet	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
uh-huh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
hm	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
oh well that's good	2056	B
yeah	2056	B
is it	2056	B
i don't know maybe would you think a	2056	B
better student to teacher ratio	2056	B
do they have too many kids in most day cares for the people they have	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
um-hum	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
uh-huh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
oh my goodness	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah um we don't yeah we don't have any but we have you know plenty of sisters and brothers that that have them_1 and	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
i'm not sure that there is a solution to that as far as uh the- day- there you know everybody has in their mind the kind of day care that they want but	2056	B
it seems you know that there's not really the perfect one out there	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
right and that's not even possible anymore i don't think to be able to take care of your own kids without you know with everybody working these days	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
uh-huh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
oh yeah	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah that seems probably the best way to do it	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah yeah um	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
i haven't really the only day cares that i have been familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches and they seem to	2056	B
from my experience be the best at what they're doing just because of what they're based on	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
oh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
uh-huh	2056	B
yeah	2056	B
yeah i think- i think that's that's important	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
um-hum	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
how old are they	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
oh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
um-hum	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
but you know kids kids do those	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
uh-huh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
right	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
right right	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah they're probably i would think needs to be i don't know if they have any type of uh formal or informal spontaneous or routine drop ins of agencies	2056	B
you know people checking up on like they do nursing homes you know they drop in to see if you're meeting all of the requirements by law and	2056	B
and i think they need to do that with day cares and just see what's going on	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
so but i'm not really sure	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
	2056	B
	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
yeah	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
uh-huh	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
well	2056	B
i don't know what we've done to solve any of this but i've enjoyed talking with you	2056	B
and welcome to Texas	2056	B
<silence>	2056	B
thank you bye-bye	2056	B
	2056	B
	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
well what do- do you think in terms of uh benefits	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
absolutely	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
well i have to agree with that you know i was thinking about um importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent	2062	A
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone	2062	A
when i was much younger it was uh	2062	A
less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
i think they have um	2062	A
a one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the	2062	A
uh CODA Plan it's	2062	A
certainly a a supplemental way uh and i suppose if but- maybe in in your instance if if you're started with TI in your	2062	A
early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them_1 until you're sixty five then you'll have a very good retirement plan	2062	A
but i	2062	A
had another career first and then came to TI a little later	2062	A
so it's not uh all by itself it won't be adequate for for my situation	2062	A
so i have to find a way to supplement that	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
i understand- understand though it uh believe me i do that myself and i disagree with you i don't think it's the worst investment in the world	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later	2062	A
uh it's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
over many many years	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
i understand that approach that's what that's exactly what's happening in my family	2062	A
except that mine are a little bit older and and i've shown them_1 the numbers and said	2062	A
this is what's going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there you better make sure that you've got a scholarship	2062	A
	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
i know and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them_1 um	2062	A
i have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist and i said that's wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that	2062	A
and then her little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that	2062	A
	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
well that's fantastic and on whole on- i would say that they're	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
equal to uh most of our competitors	2062	A
uh i can see some some potential changes that	2062	A
probably are are would not cost very much but	2062	A
might uh make things a little easier such as offering a a smorgasbord	2062	A
having a larger variety of benefits but here's the amount that that TI is going to pay for it now it's up to you it's menu selection so to speak	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime	2062	A
and i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that	2062	A
uh	2062	A
and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one	2062	A
uh	2062	A
as- as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day	2062	A
but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate that's- uh that's running in each department	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
well that's for sure	2062	A
<silence>	2062	A
oh i'm sure personalities always come into play uh just in this size of organization	2062	A
<silence>	2062	B
well personally you know i think you know of course i'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think that uh we've probably got one of the best around you know besides	2062	B
yeah they tend to offer adequate- adequate vacation i guess and the paid time off is wonderful and uh	2062	B
 one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and i think that is just a a fabulous one so i don't know if you participate in that or not but	2062	B
isn't it great	2062	B
it's just a it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
uh-huh	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
uh-huh	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
i had never really thought of it that way but i guess that's true i guess that's true i'm still young enough that that uh the vacation's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing but uh	2062	B
you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh celebrated my fifth year at TI the end of last month and uh	2062	B
kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know now that i'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about and	2062	B
you know when you're when you're you know in your i'm only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but uh it's i guess now is the time to think about it so	2062	B
 does TI have a pretty good retirement package do you think	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
right	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
uh-huh	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
it's not gonna be build up quite enough yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah well they just they seem to make it so easy to save you know one of the things that we're doing which is probably	2062	B
the worst investment in the world but i've got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check and it's probably not a great investment but if i wasn't doing that	2062	B
the money wouldn't be being saved anyway you know you- i kind of have to trade off you know if you never see it you don't spend it so and it's	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
do you yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
do you really not i- i you know i- i debate about whether it's really good or not you know	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah that's true that's very true	2062	B
we went uh and did a a thing through IBS which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in in Dallas	2062	B
and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that every- all the things that you need to work on and you need to do	2062	B
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education we have a two year old you know and and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know we have to do that now and and uh	2062	B
 they have a way that they can figure you know what you know and he's two now in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost you know and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to it's	2062	B
 what it costs now is ridiculous what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just	2062	B
really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fifteen- between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have	2062	B
you know money for his college and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it you know in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know we we can worry about other things so	2062	B
yeah yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
is it really yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
uh-huh	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
that's right that's right well that's what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college and	2062	B
and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship	2062	B
to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just can't do it you know	2062	B
so i don't know it's it's i don't uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just don't know how anybody's going to do it	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
oh goodness	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah exactly exactly	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
that's right that's right	2062	B
well you know TI you know TI offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have	2062	B
you know all this is the first really large company i've worked for i've always been involved in little small you know individual- privately owned owned firms and so i've never had the the big benefit package so i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know it	2062	B
when i came on it was great see because_1 i had never had anything even close to what what they offered so i've been real pleased	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
think so	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
um-hum	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah and you can pick what you want and yeah	2062	B
right that sounds really good i read a thing i don't even remember if it was in the Dallas Site or the Inside one about uh	2062	B
companies allowing you and they said that TI was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea	2062	B
you know if you've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week	2062	B
then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know and they're deducting it all along so	2062	B
you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them_1 at the time you know you're- you're really not being paid for them_1 the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know	2062	B
so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
um-hum	2062	B
um-hum	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
well true true	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
um-hum	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
yeah	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
um-hum well and yeah and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and	2062	B
you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesn't get it you know but that's and that's that way with a lot of things you know	2062	B
there it seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what you're going to get and what you're not going to get so	2062	B
which is the same but but then it's probably that way anywhere you know that's	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
um-hum	2062	B
<silence>	2062	B
<silence>	2057	B
yes	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
oh i love food and i love to cook i really love to cook i'm not a really gourmet cook i'm just a normal everyday cook what about you	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
don't you do you miss meat at all	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
um-hum	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
so when- if you have if you have people over would you fix all vegetables or you know when you cook for company do you fix just all vegetables	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yes but that's	2057	B
do you eat cheese do you eat like- eggs an	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
 yeah	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
but it's becoming more that way i think it's probably easier now to find things	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
i don't think i even know what a lentil is	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
i've heard i've heard of a lentil	2057	B
uh-huh um-hum	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
you had to learn i was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to cook	2057	B
oh no way	2057	B
but i bet it's really i bet it is healthy because a couple of times last week i went without meat	2057	B
um i had pasta and salad for two days just because i just want- you know oh no particular reason i just didn't feel like eating meat and uh i think even after two days i felt different	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
so when you prepare a meal like say on Thanksgiving what do you	2057	B
	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
everything but the turkey	2057	B
	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
even the turkey yeah that's true	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
well do they have special cookbooks out for for just vegetarian meal- meals you know special books that you	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
but you don't eat fish either do you	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
i have a	2057	B
i have a hard time with vegetables i don't i when i was a kid i didn't like them_1 very much and i never really learned how to cook them_1	2057	B
right i guess i don't know	2057	B
um i'll eat a little bit of broccoli and i'll steam it and i like carrots just certain things you know but uh i'm not really good with them and i'll go sometimes and not even fix them_1 i mean i'll have everything else and no vegetable that's strange isn't it	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
yeah	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
but now if you cook them_1 wrong you can loose the vitamins to	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
and i'm terribly overweight i'm obese probably is the word i've never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better	2057	B
<silence>	2057	B
<silence>	2057	A
okay did it click okay um well how do you feel about food and cooking	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
um-hum	2057	A
well we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i i just became a vegetarian over the past uh year and a half	2057	A
and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and	2057	A
it's a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of	2057	A
uh things that you want to eat that aren't vegetable- you know that aren't don't contain meat products or don't contain animal products but maybe aren't you know uh balanced meal so to speak	2057	A
so but we we feel a lot better since we've become vegetarians	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
i did at first but um not really no not i- i can't imagine eating meat	2057	A
um the reason i changed uh changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i- i think of it as something alive	2057	A
you know so it i can't do it you know for- for me it's it just	2057	A
but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly uh say steak or something you know that i- i do admit that i	2057	A
you know still- wish you know that i could have that flavor but but i know what it i know what it is so i you know i don't want it but	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah you you'd be surprised the things i mean you could like tonight we're having um nature burgers which are like a grain burger	2057	A
and you can it's really pretty good i- i the people i serve it to like my sister and family members	2057	A
well my family members are vegetarians now basically i mean they're not they're not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat other meat- you know meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals	2057	A
and uh you can make- you know make uh pasta meals and	2057	A
different things that people are use to eating that wouldn't offend you know that they wouldn't be offended that there wasn't a meat there	2057	A
you know at the at the table or even pizzas you can make a pizza that's not that doesn't have any animal product- animal you know	2057	A
you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah we do eat i- i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is a person that eats um no animal products no cheeses no eggs	2057	A
and that's even more difficult it's really hard to find the products and it's hard that's even harder to keep yourself from eating	2057	A
because it it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or	2057	A
	2057	A
and- eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs it's hard to find substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things	2057	A
so although you can i mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it it's a lot more expensive too i think you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan so but um	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah it if well it really is because today- just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils and i	2057	A
you know i wasn't really sure whether they would have lentils in the grocery store we've been living in Bermuda and in Bermuda they had a um a health food store that really had a lot of good stuff	2057	A
and where we're living now is a small town that really doesn't you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores	2057	A
and they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like that you know which	2057	A
yeah see that lot of people don't and that's	2057	A
yeah like lentil soup or something people don't and that's such a good source of protein or like soybeans you know people think ugh they think it's something really	2057	A
horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there so um	2057	A
it's it's just a matter of learning you know	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah so but it	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
um-hum	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah well think of it as- think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest	2057	A
and you know if you've got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep it's still sitting there digesting so you you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat	2057	A
you know because_1 it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat	2057	A
so	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
 um	2057	A
you prepare a lot of vegetables and there's lots of different casseroles and things so you just make you just-	2057	A
no yeah you just you just well see at ours uh we're living with my family my folks now so	2057	A
you know they they have the turkey you know they do they can't- they you can't stop you know everyone's life but um	2057	A
i think if in our own house we didn't we would have things like a casserole things like that that centered more on	2057	A
the vegetables as far as	2057	A
we might have one special dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey you know with the main meal kind of thing	2057	A
and and i suppose because it's for me ethical we'd just play up the fact that	2057	A
	2057	A
so	2057	A
um	2057	A
but it it's interesting finding different recipes although my mother is the one that cooks um	2057	A
which	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah yeah lots of them_1 lots of them_1 and uh i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact it's called Sundays at the Moosewood Restaurant and	2057	A
uh it's out of New York it's a pretty famous restaurant out of New York and almost every single recipe in there is um vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything	2057	A
 no we don't eat fish either but it the majority of the book is um vegetarian with no meats so or you know of any any kind of animal	2057	A
so there's quite a few out there	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
um-hum	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah it's strange because well it it's not strange because i use to be the same way and i'm even to this day you know some vegetables really turn me off but when you read so much information that says	2057	A
this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs and when you think about what is what's the real reason your eating i know i know it's for taste because_1 i'm boy am i a taste person but	2057	A
but really- the main reason is for fuel you know and and when you read so much information that tells you that meats	2057	A
and different animal products you know are causing uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases	2057	A
you know like heart- heart diseases and different diabetes and things like that different kinds of diseases it's like uh is it really worth it	2057	A
and the people i- i really think in general people in the United States just don't eat enough vegetables you know because	2057	A
you can talk grain all you want as far as you know cleaning your system out so to speak but you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and and the the the kind that you can't get from a little pill	2057	A
because_1 your body doesn't doesn't synthesis- synthesis in the same way that it does when it gets it in raw food you know	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah that's true that's true so you it's it's all important you know it's an all important thing that you	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
i think you'd feel probably a lot healthier um my almost- almost everyone in my family is is obese	2057	A
<silence>	2057	A
yeah i- i would say you know the- almost everyone and uh except- except me except myself and you know my husband but um	2057	A
and uh yeah i- i	2057	A
	2057	A
she- my mother says she feels healthier-	2057	A
	2041	A
uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
uh-huh	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum you're a student	2041	A
uh-huh	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um i'm i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise i	2041	A
i don't feel like i	2041	A
i don't very often do things for the sake of exercise i don't feel well unless i am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things	2041	A
like um i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time	2041	A
but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
you know	2041	A
mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and i spend a lot of time and i probably get more exercise than your average person	2041	A
but it's not a a structured sort of thing and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yes yes	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah yeah is that why you like aerobics classes because you're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah would that we could	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
right you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
hm well you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
uh	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
 so it's the it's it's the the active- well it's actually it's interesting because there are real- real regional differences um in California there's uh almost an assumption	2041	A
um	2041	A
unless you're sort of clearly of an	2041	A
uh an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that i'm i'm i'm	2041	A
i'm not uh there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California and maybe not i don't know about rural California too well but in urban California it's just	2041	A
you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here	2041	A
and before that there was the running craze and they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere so there must be something to some of them and uh	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
well there's a sense of it being a package i think there there is a sense of you know whole there's a lot of uh you know you'll get	2041	A
organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and uh oh the University- University- University- the University of California at Berkeley puts out The Wellness Letter	2041	A
which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter	2041	A
monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and	2041	A
and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it it's	2041	A
on fairly solid- solid scientific ground uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions it says every- all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together	2041	A
and uh so it's had that orientation for quite sometime um there's been some progressive medical schools out here	2041	A
that have taken that approach and um	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
boy yeah that there's a i- i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which which caused the other they sort of developed- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more	2041	A
yeah and some-	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah yeah exactly	2041	A
and part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was	2041	A
um people becoming interested in alternate	2041	A
practices i don't know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know	2041	A
which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh AMA approved medicine um you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here and	2041	A
and you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things and before long	2041	A
you you get this this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options	2041	A
and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them	2041	A
the irony is is it's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented	2041	A
towards	2041	A
doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers last thing pardon me	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
oh like everything else yeah yeah the rat race to exercise	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah well i- i think so i mean you you've if you look at certain- if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about	2041	A
people who were considered very healthy in China and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and	2041	A
	2041	A
and a lot of that is diet that's true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference um	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yes as am i actually i as am i	2041	A
yes	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
it is in the urban areas yes most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now	2041	A
well most most modern- sort of modern looking restaurants will	2041	A
you can	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in Texas and and and uh it occurred to me	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah yeah	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
yeah	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2041	A
<silence>	2041	A
	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
what- um well um my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class he's an aerobics instructor	2041	B
and um is going to be uh entering North Texas for a kinesiology program there	2041	B
and um the the how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach	2041	B
yeah so i'm i'm an avid aerobics uh person and just very very athletic enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports	2041	B
so and how do you feel about it	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
yeah well i i've my that's the way my mother stands on it she feels like if it's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore and and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore	2041	B
so um and i feel that way too as far as	2041	B
you- you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know to	2041	B
you know a a calculated- you know calculated down and and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or but but i do try and um	2041	B
i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
yeah	2041	B
and it's got and i've always enjoyed dance	2041	B
so it involves you know i- i can't get out to dance all the time	2041	B
and yeah and it's and it's more regulated i mean you're you're using different parts of the body so it it is like dance and- and it's structured like	2041	B
that but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me	2041	B
and someone else is telling me okay you know let's- let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
yeah yeah but i'm like you i also um	2041	B
like to participate in uh things like well we just went to the uh Myerson Symphony Run this past weekend and and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people and um	2041	B
just get out you know out and about and it's it it's something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was it was quite a lot of fun and biking and i- i- i love to swim so i love it when you know it's	2041	B
swimming weather and uh	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
oh i didn't realize that i'm sorry well i'm in Texas i- i just assumed that i had this is the first call i've done and i didn't realize that they had were going to	2041	B
reach out to people from all over the country	2041	B
you wouldn't know that oh i	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
well i think people are are more encouraged-	2041	B
people from California seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and uh just	2041	B
your- your- your health consciousness and i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of California not just exercise but health health related	2041	B
ideas and i it- it's curious i don't know why don't know if it's	2041	B
 do you does California have a	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
now do you think that's because they've realized that	2041	B
for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program	2041	B
do you think the program came first or the	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
yeah	2041	B
or they're older well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural area- i- i- i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city i live in a rural area so you know i see the	2041	B
it's it's yeah it's it's like it's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area um almost you know doesn't worry about it to such a degree but	2041	B
stays you know more healthier you know as a fit person	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
um-hum	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B
yeah well don't you think a lot of that is diet too yeah	2041	B
<silence>	2041	B

you- you know you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country so	2041	B

organic you know materials and foods and things you don't really have that i mean you would think	2041	B
	2054	B

and then with the wind chill it got lower but that was	2054	B
it was you know it doesn't you know it was real unusual	2054	B
so	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B

uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh you know when we get snow and ice here it just shuts down the city	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
yeah because_1 nobody knows how to drive in it so when you get i mean	2054	B
here they start even forecast the weather you know it's gonna be an ice storm tomorrow	2054	B
they'll come before the ten clock news they've already got schools calling in saying they've canceled	2054	B
yeah they don't even wait around here to see if they canceled it in the night before and	2054	B
 we've had them_1 you know say that they're going to be get this real bad ice storm and	2054	B
um it's beautiful the next day i mean the weather here is so unpredictable you know i i don't even put much stock in the weather reports anymore because they're hardly ever	2054	B
accurate	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B

oh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
yeah they get a little bit of in- rain here and they suspect it's going to freeze and the sand trucks are out	2054	B
yeah because_1 we have you know	2054	B
it gets even in a rainstorm here that roads get so slick	2054	B
you know it's no not even cold weather but just rain because_1 the roads get so oily	2054	B
that uh	2054	B
we've had you know twelve car pile ups and stuff on the freeways because_1	2054	B
people just they don't slow down for nothing around here so	2054	B

<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B

<silence>	2054	B
oh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
yeah it's amazing how it can be so different in one part of the country	2054	B
see- because_1 i have family in Boston too so um-hum	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
but going through it's so much different yeah	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh yeah because_1 his family my husband's family lives in	2054	B
in um Anaheim California you know just	2054	B
couple you know miles from Disneyland and	2054	B
so it's amazing how it's you know it can be cold here and beautiful there so-	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
yeah	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
you could never get use to that kind of weather	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
uh-huh right	2054	B
that's how it was in Wyoming too you just you know it was always cold then you can you only had um two or three months that you could plant a garden	2054	B
and here we can get three gardens in a year	2054	B
we can replant three times a year and and get stuff so	2054	B
<silence>	2054	B
um we've got onions and potatoes and um	2054	B
broccoli and	2054	B
what else all that kinds of stuff like that planted	2054	B
	2054	A
so let me tell you a little bit about the weather here last Sunday night we had an ice storm	2054	A
which took down all of our trees all the power lines all the phone lines	2054	A
it was it- it was incredible it um it occurred about two thirty at night	2054	A
or in the morning actually um for the past six days we've been out heat without power	2054	A
um without a phone we've basically been living out of suitcases at friend's house that happened to have power it's really been horrible	2054	A
we're um we live in Rochester New York	2054	A
so i mean normally you know this time of year it's very cold and we have a lot of snow and and all that and this has just been something we've we've never seen an ice storm like this before	2054	A
and people that actually were staying home um	2054	A
without any heat they were estimating it was getting down to about thirty degrees inside the house without any heat	2054	A
it's really been crazy	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
uh	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
are you serious	2054	A
do are you someone that likes the heat	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
what is it normally like there this time of year	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
so would it	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
today it's sixty five	2054	A
oh that's great you must be feeling like it's uh	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh that's so nice	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
 yeah compared to what we're having	2054	A
	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
yeah	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
so what's the lowest that the temperature would ever get there	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
they did oh wow	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
this past Thursday we had winds and and snow to the point where if you walked outside and if you're walking against the wind	2054	A
you almost couldn't move because the wind wouldn't- wouldn't let you walk it was so strong it was really	2054	A
well um on Monday all the businesses were closed	2054	A
and then on Tuesday i would say about half of the businesses were closed	2054	A
um they finally opened up again i- i don't want to even say as normal because nothing was really normal this week people were faced with	2054	A
trees through their cars you know trees had fallen right on top of their cars um	2054	A
other people had had trees go right through there rooftops	2054	A
it's just it- that- as a matter of fact um Governor Cuomo the Governor of New York	2054	A
is supposedly asking Bush now to declare Rochester um a disasters area	2054	A
and obviously to get some funding to help clean up this mess	2054	A
but it's really you know besides just the inconvenience of it all it's it's pretty sad because	2054	A
Rochester had some nice parks and some really beautiful tree lined streets and they're all just destroyed	2054	A
they were all torn down um the ice it- it was really just a crippling	2054	A
thing for the whole city	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
i can imagine there be	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
yeah	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
really	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh that's funny	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh jeez	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
yeah	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
well i grew up in Boston and in Boston um we get our share of snow but it was always very very well cleaned up	2054	A
they would be the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and sand and you know it would then the next morning it would be fine	2054	A
and in Rochester they i guess they feel that they get so much snow that they don't clean it up for just a little bit	2054	A
so even for three or four inches you're just driving right on it the streets haven't been plowed	2054	A
there's no salt on the ground nothing they wait -until they get a major storm	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh really	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
really	2054	A
oh my gosh	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
that's crazy	2054	A
sure	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh i'm sorry-	2054	A
oh	2054	A
i thought you were saying can you hold on oh okay	2054	A
uh oh i see	2054	A
	2054	A
well i just came back from getting our new clothes for today and we'll try last- we stayed all last week with one set of friends and um	2054	A
they were having company this weekend so we had to move and you just feel like you're imposing on people you know	2054	A
oh no they're averaging um well there estimating that next by next Thursday	2054	A
everybody should have there power back	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
the schools were all closed this week and they're still thinking of closing them on Monday because	2054	A
for little kids it's it's still kind of dangerous on to be on the sidewalks because there might be some live wires hanging down and	2054	A
and there're a lot of streets that are just closed	2054	A
because you just can't drive on them and there's too many trees and that sort of thing	2054	A
but it- one thing that was very funny is on Monday um almost every single store in Rochester had been sold out of batteries	2054	A
because people are needing batteries for portable radios and flashlights and	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
really and we had uh you know a -refrigerator- a refrigerator full of food and a freezer full of food	2054	A
and that's all been just you know it's you can't use it it's it's just gone bad	2054	A
so this storm really it's- uh it's been incredible	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
right exactly as a matter of fact we made on to i don't know if you ever watch Dan Rather	2054	A
the CBS news	2054	A
he mentioned um i guess it was Monday night or Tuesday night he mentioned the state of emergency	2054	A
and we all felt like finally we made it to the national news but	2054	A
i don't know i would much rather be in the warm of sun	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
well throughout all of this i called my in-laws who live in Florida	2054	A
and they just finished putting in a pool	2054	A
so while i was sitting freezing in a pay phone outside of our house	2054	A
um they were sitting by the pool sipping you know a glass of wine and	2054	A
oh it was really it was horrible	2054	A
but	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
it really is	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh you do oh	2054	A
i remember the earthquake last year and i you- you know i guess you didn't you like the earthquake over in San Francisco remember that and	2054	A
you know you can hear about it on TV and you just think so	2054	A
yeah exactly and you just never think it could happen to you	2054	A
but	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
yeah that's true	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
well western New York is suppose to be use to this kind of weather but	2054	A
right now people uh the the crews that are	2054	A
no it's true	2054	A
but there are some people that just love it i mean there are people that even if it gets to	2054	A
sixty degrees they feel that's too hot	2054	A
and they just they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and and that's why they live here i guess but	2054	A
you- you for the month between basically November and April	2054	A
if you don't like the snow and the cold then you might as well just pack your bags and leave	2054	A
because_1 that's all that's all there is here	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
oh yeah	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
um-hum	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
that is great what do you plant this time of year	2054	A
<silence>	2054	A
and what	2054	A
	2067	B
well um with credit cards is me i i try to keep maybe just one or two i don't i don't like having credit cards for every store i i uh i just don't like them	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
what am i afraid of um i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much i just uh don't think that i need them you know i uh	2067	B
they are tempting at times but i i just you know	2067	B
sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know so	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
so and there you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money so	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
yeah	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
uh-huh	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
that's right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
that's right uh-huh	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
uh-huh	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
that's what i do	2067	B
that's what i do just a second- <b_aside> Whitney <e_aside>	2067	B
<b_aside> i will i'm on the phone honey <e_aside>	2067	B
sorry	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
i have two little ones yeah yeah so but always want some um four and two and a half	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
yes uh yeah i'm i'm like you i i use my only use my credit card for um	2067	B
you know when i you know i just use it whenever i feel like i don't want to write a check and then but i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at the end of the month	2067	B
so	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i don't even think i know my number	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
uh-huh that's right see we he couldn't do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing	2067	B
yeah	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
uh-huh	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
you're right and that's kind of silly	2067	B
yeah your defeating the purpose	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
	2067	B
yeah	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
yeah	2067	B
yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it because i	2067	B
yeah	2067	B
yeah it's like	2067	B
i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know you've already been preapproved	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
yes everybody in the country is preapproved i think	2067	B
	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
so	2067	B
yeah	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
uh-huh yeah and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find	2067	B
wow i didn't realize i had this much you know i'd spent this much money and then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
uh-huh	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
yeah it does because you're you know you're you know you're just costing- costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the monthly the minimum payment you're paying interest again so yeah	2067	B
<silence>	2067	B
yes it's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well you you too good luck bye-bye	2067	B
	2067	B
	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
 what are you afraid of with them	2067	A
yes	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
well that's very can be very very true	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest	2067	A
i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
that's all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
oh boy those are two very active ages	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
uh-huh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
	2067	A
well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash	2067	A
and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
yeah right absolutely because they figure that that's correct the idea is to use their money	2067	A
	2067	A
and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
um-hum	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
well it-	2067	A
and oh absolutely preapproved that's their favorite word	2067	A
 i think so you're right well it's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
that much spent right	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem	2067	A
<silence>	2067	A
that's right that's right well it's been enjoyable talking with you	2067	A
	2067	A
right well take good care take care of your little ones uh-huh bye-bye	2067	A
	2067	A
this is Archie	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
have you seen Dancing with Wolf	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
have you ever lived in that part of the country	2010	B
have you ever visited it	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
i think it was the Black Hills of South Dakota	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
well i lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh	2010	B
yeah is is fairly familiar- the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it's gonna win everything	2010	B
uh and i had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i- i- i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story	2010	B
and and and i guess that's what i really like although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour yeah	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
no i've heard i've heard that's really great though	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
no you must really keep up	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
well- isn't isn't Sleeping with the Enemy isn't that a is- is it is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
do you do you listen to Gary Cohill Cohill- is uh you know who he is	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
he's a the movie critic um oh you've oh okay he's a movie critic -on channel eight in Dallas	2010	B
and he does uh he has a talk show on the	2010	B
KLIF anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and and and people call in and it's if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting there's a certain amount of drivel that they do they've got uh they've got a couple of kids	2010	B
ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it's uh	2010	B
he anyway he it's interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch the movie fact they had people had just seen i was listening Sunday night a little bit when i was uh going to	2010	B
pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh it- the it it's interesting though the the the difficulty with with Dancing with Wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it	2010	B
uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good or did he just do it	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver	2010	B
a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
he he plays on Murphy Brown	2010	B
yes he's	2010	B
he's Eldon her housepainter	2010	B
	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
that's that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no it's really funny but i thought it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a	2010	B
you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean it's uh	2010	B
	2010	B
i don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about five minutes i should think we've done enough	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
well i don't know what- how do we end this thing i think it just says hang up	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
 why don't we do that good-bye Sharon	2010	B
<silence>	2010	B
<silence>	2010	A
hi Archie i'm Sharon	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
yeah i've seen that that's uh that was a really good movie probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and uh	2010	A
i thought the story was pretty good too i think- i think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
no i haven't	2010	A
um i've visited the Wyoming area i'm not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was filmed	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
could be i- i haven't been to South Dakota	2010	A
have- have you been up to that	2010	A
oh okay	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
terrain	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
really	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
that's true i agree with that um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think it's been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud so it it has surprised everybody	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
uh-huh	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
right	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
did you	2010	A
have you seen Sleeping with the Enemy	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
you- you have to go see that one and how about_1 Silence of the Lambs go	2010	A
i do i go every weekend i- i uh those are two definite must see movies i think	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
	2010	A
it's suspenseful i don't think it's very terror- i mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it's it's more suspense	2010	A
um the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's it's pretty graphic at points but uh i think they're both excellent movies	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
no huh-uh	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
yeah	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
 oh	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
uh-huh	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i don't- i don't think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do	2010	A
he wanted to direct it he wanted to act- to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really wanted- he really wanted it whether it	2010	A
whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because	2010	A
i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
um	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
yeah who no i don't know who that guy is	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
oh he does	2010	A
as a recurring character every week	2010	A
 oh no now see i'd a i'd a never put those two together	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
huh-uh	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
yeah	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
yeah real scruffy looking	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
yeah	2010	A
<silence>	2010	A
you think so i mean i haven't been watching my watch um	2010	A
	2010	A
	2089	A
okay so are you a fisherman	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
 yeah you know i'm just about in the same situation here a few years ago i got really got into it hot and heavy and about like you say i guess the last couple of years i've kind of gotten out of the it i've got kids now that are	2089	A
are old enough to play summer baseball and fall league basketball and that kind of stuff and uh man i just don't have the time to go like i want to	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
 oh really	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
i tell you it really is hard to to get time to go fishing uh you know unless you just	2089	A
really really work at it almost it's it's it's almost like a second job	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah yeah i'm i'm i like to go after them big old black bass	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
oh i got a few little old ponds up around here you know there's several around here just i do a lot of oh just small farm fishing and uh i mean small farm tank fishing and you know uh rock pit fishing but i've been to uh	2089	A
oh the last i guess the last big lake i went to was Lake Fork	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
um-hum	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yes	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
oh are you	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah it's	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
yeah that is a problem	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
uh-huh	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah well i don't either really i- i like messing with the lures and	2089	A
that seems to be what the the bass like and what you can catch with the lures so that's that's generally what i fish for you know because_1 i don't particularly like to eat fish i just like to catch them_1 and throw them_1 back	2089	A
but it's uh you know i- i got into that mode where i was buying lures and and rods and reels and just all kinds of stuff i had one of those little two man uh little two man boats that	2089	A
used to go around a lot use that a lot but	2089	A
like i say i kind of got out of the fishing business when the kids got up big enough so i got sold that and	2089	A
but it's uh	2089	A
but yeah so i'm kind of limited now to going back to my old farm pond	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
well as a matter of fact uh last last fall uh in uh	2089	A
October i guess i bought uh i bought a boat but i bought a a ski boat	2089	A
gonna keep it	2089	A
yeah yeah you can it's it's not the same as a bass boat but yeah you can get out on the water that's the main thing	2089	A
but i- i used to go with a friend at work quite a bit uh he had uh he had a uh bass boat and he's the one i went to uh	2089	A
oh like i say we went to Lake Fork and Cypress Springs and we've been to Lavon and Texoma just	2089	A
 been around quite a bit in the kind of local area	2089	A
but he sold his boat too so so we just kind of	2089	A
we kind of grounded ourselves in that respect	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
uh-huh	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah that's well you don't have to but it it makes it easier you got to have uh well if you have a Texoma license you can fish anywhere on the lake	2089	A
if you have only a Texas license you have to stay on the Texas side of the lake which uh uh as it turns out most of the lake is in Oklahoma	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
yeah yeah	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
	2089	A
go- go across the bridge across the water if it looks good you can just pullover and start it then	2089	A
yeah now i've got most of mine hung up in the garage now like i say it's been a while since i've	2089	A
since i've even gotten to go	2089	A
pretty days	2089	A
like today like this weekend of course it's too windy now but you know it usually dies down around sundown i've got a little old pond just	2089	A
oh just a few hundred yards from my back door that i go over there occasionally but	2089	A
you know it's pretty small and got pretty small fish in it but	2089	A
it's nice to get out and just start splashing on the water or something	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
no i don't take any magazines but i like to watch old Berry Stokes	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah he's he's about my favorite	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
 B A S S yeah um-hum	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
oh really	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
yeah that's yeah i have taken some fishing magazines in the past and that's that's generally what i found that seemed like they spend a lot of time	2089	A
uh discussing the type fishing that i wasn't really interested in	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
yeah it's really more kind of all over the south isn't it	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
yeah what uh what do you get when you uh when you join the B A S S what kind of benefits to you get	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
um-hum	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
	2089	A
yeah tackle and stuff	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
uh-huh	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
yeah i know the uh Bass Pro Shops uh i get their catalogs but that's almost like a Christmas in the summertime when that comes but	2089	A
yeah i've noticed they they're now	2089	A
pushing a MasterCard that you know they're supposed to spend so much of the money on on conservation measures and stuff	2089	A
which is a good idea i guess	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
oh yeah	2089	A
yeah especially as popular as fishing is getting you know in the last few years last five or ten years i guess it's it's really picked up in popularity again	2089	A
so it's a lot more	2089	A
you know a lot more people using the lakes and facilities and putting more pressure on the fish and taking more fish out of the lakes	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
no i haven't	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah now Ray Roberts i haven't been over there but i've i understand there's quite a few people who have been i- i think that's really going to be a good bass lake	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
uh-huh	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah i understand it's kind of kind of restricted or or doesn't have easy access really	2089	A
	2089	A
	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
which which is a yeah which is all right you know that that's all you can do that's all you can do but	2089	A
it's good to get out there and and like i say throw the lure out and just	2089	A
just piddle with it a little while	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
 yeah some of them_1 it takes a little while to get them to do what what you think they ought to be done	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
uh-huh yeah	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
yeah yes it's just that that pork skin uh	2089	A
which you know you can get the artificial pork or you can use the real slab of pork but yeah that's that's what it is it just	2089	A
yeah uh-huh	2089	A
<silence>	2089	A
	2089	A
yeah	2089	A
that's that's what is amazing you know all these different rigs that people come up with you know the Carolina worm rig and the like i said the jig and pig but	2089	A
i'd i'd i like top water fishing myself you know everybody said	2089	A
<silence>	2089	B
	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
yeah well mine are are kids are both grown so that's uh that's that's past the point now where where i can use them as an excuse but	2089	B
working and doing things around the house you know keeps you pretty busy anyway so	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah what uh	2089	B
yeah when you do fish do you fish for bass or just	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
go after the big ones yeah where have you fished recently	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah i have not made it to Lake Fork yet although i've talked about it and uh	2089	B
i've got uh i'm a CPA and i've got clients that uh or a client that lives on uh Lake Tawakoni	2089	B
that has told me you know anytime i wanna fish you know just come on over	2089	B
got a client that lives at Lake at Cedar Creek Lake and like i'm from East Texas so i've got uh i think my brother-in-law may have a place at Lake Palestine so	2089	B
you know i can go fishing just about anywhere i want to go but it's a matter of finding the time you know	2089	B
but uh most of my fishing has been uh	2089	B
just you know whatever you know whatever will bite i'll fish for and my brother-in-law likes to fish for uh crappie	2089	B
and so i fish a bit with him you know fishing for those and then uh you know i fish for bass fish but basically like i said fish for what whatever i can catch	2089	B
i don't know enough about fishing to you know to say uh i'm going to go after a particular kind so	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
um-hum	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah so so are you a	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah so are you uh anticipating buying another boat or just	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
 well you can fish for you can bass fish from a ski boat yeah	2089	B
uh-huh	2089	B
yeah that's	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
right on	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
um yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah well the last time i had anticipated fishing i thought i might fish at Lake Texoma i was going up there with a group	2089	B
and uh	2089	B
when i got there discovered you have to have a special- special license to fish on the lake right	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah well that's what i understood anyway i- i discovered- discovered it was much- much better to have uh uh Texoma license	2089	B
and i didn't have that so i said well i wasn't going to that plus there wasn't anybody else fishing you know in the group so i said well i just won't worry about it	2089	B
and that was probably the last time i even tried to fish and or even thought about it but	2089	B
i've got uh my fishing tackle in the trunk of my car so if the urge ever	2089	B
	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah right	2089	B
but	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
but uh do you uh read anything about fishing do you have any any books or magazines or anything that you take that you	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah well i enjoy him too yeah but uh	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah i watch i- i take uh have just started taking the that bass joined the Bass Anglers Club you know and get their magazine	2089	B
and uh then i take the Texas Fisherman	2089	B
uh	2089	B
and uh you know i find those to be pretty good they uh the Texas Fisherman they uh they do cover a pretty broad range of fishing but they cover a lot spend a lot of time on salt water you know	2089	B
along the coast	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
uh-huh	2089	B
yeah and then of course i guess the Bass you know the Bass Anglers book is uh covers the pretty well covers the country	2089	B
so you don't get a lot of Texas you know in particular coverage in that but	2089	B
still you get some pretty good tips	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
i believe so it's their headquarters are in Alabama so	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
well uh there's a number of things that you can get but basically you get the the magazine and you get that patch you know you know you get a patch and you get the bumper sticker	2089	B
but then they they're always i just joined just signed up for the magazine here a month or so ago but they you know they send you offers and things uh	2089	B
lure- lure packages and things like that that you can	2089	B
if you matter of fact if you uh get other people to sign up you know that to to sign up for the thing you know	2089	B
then you get lure packages or pocket knives or things like that but	2089	B
but they've got uh i think they might even have a a Visa card or something that they promote you know through the club and	2089	B
they've got uh discounts on travel rental cars and things like that that	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
right	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
yeah it's a good idea i think i think we need to we need to do a lot more on on the conservation than you know	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah so you haven't fished uh Joe Pool Lake down here yet i guess or uh what's the other one Ray Roberts is that	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
yeah but uh yeah i uh Joe Pool is so close uh you know close into Dallas it's a little bit of a drive from Richardson	2089	B
to get down there but i've got a uh couple of clients that are down in that area	2089	B
i just i just i thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to just	2089	B
like i said just pull over and fish a while	2089	B
if i can find a place- a place to get to the water somehow	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah so i guess the the main thing is you know when you're like you say when you're carrying your tackle around in the trunk of your car and you don't have a boat laying in the trunk your car you're- you're kind of restricted to bank fishing so	2089	B
so you have to find a spot	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
yeah yeah i enjoy watching the just watching the lure work in the water sometimes just see what it does it uh	2089	B
yeah	2089	B
 yeah	2089	B
 one thing uh in fishing that i have not ever have not done and i'm not really sure what they mean i guess is when they're talking about	2089	B
using a jig and pig i think is the term does that mean that they	2089	B
like they use uh just uh it's like a hook with a little head on it and then just tie a piece of uh of rubber pork type stuff on the hook itself	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
um-hum	2089	B
but it's just hung on the hook	2089	B
yeah huh	2089	B
i guess i couldn't imagine that it anything like that until i started reading about it and you know and i thought you know that sounds like okay but i never would have thought of doing it so	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
um-hum	2089	B
<silence>	2089	B
	2040	A
yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
well i'm i guess	2040	A
i don't have such- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do	2040	A
um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low standard- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income	2040	A
um part of this i suppose is justified in in- in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the- the more northern territories need	2040	A
however in that case i guess i would favor status quo	2040	A
i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there	2040	A
and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem	2040	A
um it was	2040	A
it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh	2040	A
a girl from Puerto Rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors	2040	A
uh	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
well probably more on in terms of the US	2040	A
um	2040	A
you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the US copes	2040	A
with this sort of thing i've lived abroad most of my life so	2040	A
i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in Lebanon so i was very cut off from the	2040	A
the press as i was- you know	2040	A
and uh becoming- was becoming an adult so i don't know how the US would cope with it a	2040	A
new state that is so very very poor	2040	A
um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of	2040	A
like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
i think so	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um-hum	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um-hum yeah those- those are good points um which obviously i'd never thought about	2040	A
um	2040	A
i don't know what- uh i suppose	2040	A
they also not being a state are	2040	A
probably freer to determine their own	2040	A
um ways of life than they would if if	2040	A
i- i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory	2040	A
perhaps compulsory education	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um	2040	A
and taxes	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um-hum well- well actually i think- one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that	2040	A
they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway	2040	A
so if they've just taken such action	2040	A
it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want	2040	A
to declare this before they become a state	2040	A
or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
i i believe i would probably tend towards that	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
well that's interesting	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language	2040	A
as a condition for statehood	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um-hum	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um-hum um-hum	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
that's interesting because	2040	A
although i tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience	2040	A
uh	2040	A
i was in bilingual education in California and	2040	A
i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my	2040	A
my brother who- who was uh quite a bit younger	2040	A
was learning Spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word	2040	A
and so obviously it didn't work in California	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
right	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
right	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
oh i see	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
um-hum um-hum	2040	A
<silence>	2040	A
okay- okay well thank you very much	2040	A
bye-bye	2040	A
	2040	A
	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
i was a	2040	B
resident although very young of the state- of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory became a state	2040	B
uh so i guess i have a left over	2040	B
positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about Puerto Rico	2040	B
um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive uh and i kind- have a suspicion that that i	2040	B
believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other	2040	B
what is your situation	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
oh that's very interesting	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
um-hum	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
um-hum	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
i guess	2040	B
um	2040	B
we're assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or	2040	B
okay	2040	B
that's something that- that i guess i have not much of an image of other than	2040	B
than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a	2040	B
pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have	2040	B
um	2040	B
i don't know whether state would- statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the very- the act of being a state	2040	B
would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax	2040	B
i don't know if they suffer	2040	B
in a sense of	2040	B
income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be	2040	B
how do you feel though about	2040	B
well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how having- having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the states- in the	2040	B
Alaska at the time since they- they voted absentee	2040	B
i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a second- feeling of second class citizenry	2040	B
uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times	2040	B
in their not having a Senate representative	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
um-hum	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
uh i see what you mean so that	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation	2040	B
um	2040	B
frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
um it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy	2040	B
uh	2040	B
i had thought of it more in terms of political uh	2040	B
realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the US than an independent country	2040	B
so	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
um-hum	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
uh-huh	2040	B
that's interesting	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ultimately- i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
at this point	2040	B
leaning towards uh statehood	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions about- against that decision even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something	2040	B
um	2040	B
i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of America's strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i-	2040	B
am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country	2040	B
and Canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be	2040	B
a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that	2040	B
um	2040	B
i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intrudes- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
hum	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
yeah	2040	B
but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language	2040	B
but i'm i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
um	2040	B
i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
good-bye	2040	B
<silence>	2040	B
	2040	B
all right Amy how are you doing today	2025	A
oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about um tell you what i'll start off how's that	2025	A
um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back	2025	A
	2025	A
hangings on weekends	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
in public places there is one state that does that by the way	2025	A
i want to say Oklahoma i saw report- something the other night about it	2025	A
they don't do them_1 real often which is obviously the death penalty	2025	A
um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs	2025	A
and sixty dollars- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them_1 and get it over with and let's just quit screwing up the system uh	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
that's pathetic	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
that's pathetic it's-	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
this is true and- and- and- and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to	2025	A
life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
exactly	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
a life for a life	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
the old Charles Manson case i mean the guy is really	2025	A
	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge	2025	A
 the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene	2025	A
uh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off	2025	A
uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay	2025	A
um kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight	2025	A
there's a percentage- certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey	2025	A
the guy's guilty	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
exactly	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial which- is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more	2025	A
i think that that if it's an if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program	2025	A
uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because_1 that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
hm	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
yeah yeah- i get back to Price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know	2025	A
exactly	2025	A
yeah yeah i mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense	2025	A
you'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
oh so you're at the house you're not at the plant	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
oh hold it	2025	A
oh that's good that's good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasn't sure	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
oh goodness well i'll let you get i enjoyed it bye	2025	A
<silence>	2025	A
<silence>	2025	B
fine fine	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
okay you go ahead	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
um-hum	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
in public places	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
really what is that	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
hm	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months	2025	B
because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or	2025	B
you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months	2025	B
you know it's crazy	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for starving- children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that	2025	B
so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really	2025	B
i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like you know one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on	2025	B
yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
um-hum	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune- you know a fortune to keep doing that	2025	B
and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
right	2025	B
yeah yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah yeah	2025	B
well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really	2025	B
you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side	2025	B
and have some judge that was paid off or you know had good- a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power	2025	B
you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but seems like the jury system does have it's advantages	2025	B
but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know	2025	B
and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people	2025	B
	2025	B
you know	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
	2025	B
	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
oh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically	2025	B
yeah yeah	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
	2025	B
so yeah	2025	B
oh yeah i've got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room okay thanks a lot bye-bye	2025	B
<silence>	2025	B
	2025	B
<silence>	2086	A
uh-huh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
uh-huh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
uh-huh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
oh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
that's very spicy too	2086	A
i mean these bell peppers and curry	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
oh that sounds really good	2086	A
huh i guess it was is this dinner time for you	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
all done in advance	2086	A
	2086	A
that's um i uh i'm i'm not that great a cook but i was single until i was thirty so i did cook a little	2086	A
you know uh	2086	A
and i cook a little bit now what i like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says you know oh Tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight	2086	A
so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok	2086	A
and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
it's it's called a stir fry pan and it and it fits right on your uh sit- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does	2086	A
and um normally what happen- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular	2086	A
oil- vegetable oil but i will use peanut peanut oil or things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um	2086	A
maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor	2086	A
and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um	2086	A
a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a uh a glaze	2086	A
that sticks to the the vegetables i've used you turn them over a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we don't put in meat	2086	A
cause i guess we're i'm not but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things so we'll do a lot of times vegetarian	2086	A
but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms	2086	A
it's it's a pretty big and we put that over rice	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
oh you don't	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
oh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
uh-huh	2086	A
yeah see we never in fact i never had squash growing up my my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up i'm i'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town	2086	A
yeah recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato	2086	A
red meat and a potato	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
oh she had all of those types of vegetables	2086	A
see never no vegetables in my family	2086	A
yeah it was really funny	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
 well that was a real farm	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
no but i i've i've uh i've heard stories	2086	A
	2086	A
uh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
oh this is terrible- uh you shouldn't be talking about this right before you're while you're fixing dinner	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
that's right you should be careful that's pretty funny but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens but i never we never we lived in the suburbs we we bought everything in a grocery store	2086	A
there was no but it was funny you know it so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
i think so too	2086	A
	2086	A
but we just went shopping and we came back with uh with um sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts	2086	A
	2086	A
we came back with sweets we didn't bring all the healthy food back too	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
uh-huh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
well that's that's supposed to be um the trend of the future	2086	A
but uh the cut back i uh recently was over a friends house that's Indian and uh	2086	A
she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots	2086	A
yeah that was a sweet and i was like ugh	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
this is a sweet oh it is it's a candy i'm like ugh you know Indian candy is not very good	2086	A
but everything was and everything you didn't notice it at first but everything was sort of hot everything had a little bit of curry in every	2086	A
it was funny even the sweets did	2086	A
when you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it you know it had that that after taste that very it was a very Indian flavor	2086	A
good they didn't have i didn't like her desserts very well	2086	A
they were very yogurt and carrots and pin pistachios pistachio nuts and yogurt	2086	A
and it wasn't very good	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
uh-huh	2086	A
yeah	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
well have we done our ten minutes	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
something like that i think we're	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
no normally- normally they just come in and they say you've overextended your	2086	A
your conversation	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
oh okay well that's you'll see it will normally it will come on and it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen minutes to complete- fifteen seconds to complete it	2086	A
but uh i've been cut off twice	2086	A
so i just thought in fact just also i'm hearing a siren outside i think my my neighbors car must have got bumped you know he has one of those alarms on his car	2086	A
one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off	2086	A
so i was going to go out and see what they were doing	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
okay hey thanks so much	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
uh-huh and you said this was your first- well you'll you'll get a couple more probably	2086	A
i uh if i called yesterday i or Friday maybe i talked to somebody that uh	2086	A
i got them on uh during the day it was a housewife and she was home with two kids	2086	A
and while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny	2086	A
<silence>	2086	A
okay	2086	A
hey thanks a lot i'll talk to you later	2086	A
bye	2086	A
	2086	A
<silence>	2086	B
okay in order to make the uh curried chicken i just fried the chicken	2086	B
until it was nice and brown you know make sure it's nice and brown on both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you you let the chicken that you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it	2086	B
and then you you uh pour most of the all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil	2086	B
and saute some um bell peppers and onions in in that little bit of oil maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons let that brown then put all of the chicken back in there	2086	B
and then you uh mix flour and a cup of water maybe uh one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water stir it real real well	2086	B
<silence>	2086	B
then you uh pour that in there you know to make the gravy	2086	B
and you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add uh about_1 a tablespoon of what i'm using now is Jamaican curry powder	2086	B
and that's going to it's going to be really good	2086	B
yeah it's	2086	B
right and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff	2086	B
yeah	2086	B
<silence>	2086	B

softball and ceramics	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
i didn't think of working out as a hobby	2045	A
	2045	A
or playing with the computer i do both at home	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
uh we've gotten a little Atari computer uh husband describes it as a a computer with training wheels	2045	A
uh	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
no i i do ceramics i i you know the pieces are made from a mold and i paint them_1	2045	A
uh you know you get them_1 you clean them_1 up you know get the uh mold line off	2045	A
you know you scrape that off and uh make it as smooth as possible uh	2045	A
then you uh put it in a kiln and fire it you know it's like a big oven	2045	A
and uh when you pull it out it's called bisque uh it started it off with greenware	2045	A
when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and that's when you can paint it	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
no i've uh	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
you- you can rent people's kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh pay them_1 there's one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
the paints and stuff can get expensive the greenware it depends on what you buy	2045	A
now i bought a a chess set for my husband and painted it for him and i'd say the greenware for you know twenty four pieces i think is what they're no no	2045	A
thirty two pieces is a was cost- cost me about eight dollars	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh i'm a little shaky when it comes to detail work so i couldn't get the fine pieces so you know i had to	2045	A
get parts that had big spaces in them_1	2045	A
uh couldn't do the fine -detailed fine detail on it	2045	A
but uh you know i made my son his uh Donald Duck and you know the Disney characters painted them for him in real bright colors	2045	A
and uh he enjoyed them_1 till he was about two and then he uh had fun throwing them_1 and broke them_1	2045	A
<silence>	2045	A
and- that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them_1 to him and letting him breaking them_1	2045	A

at once a week uh sometimes- sometimes we play two night- games a night you know consist of uh fifteen point game and you play two games and you know the best uh person that wins two games wins	2045	A

<silence>	2008	A
so can you dress pretty casually	2008	A
yeah	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
well i um run a business out of my home	2008	A
so i tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever i wanna do with the kids then whenever i have a meeting with a client i'll put a suit on and then	2008	A
come home and get back into regular clothes again	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
yeah	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
i've recently um tried- tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that i can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot	2008	A
that's helped me a lot with having i can only have a a limited wardrobe since i'm only working part-time right now um but still it gives it some variety add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
what about your casual wear do you like to wear jeans most of the time	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
yeah	2008	A
it's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so hot	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
dress shorts	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
yeah	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A

<silence>	2008	A
um-hum	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
oh yeah it'll be comfortable	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
i guess down here uh we just recently moved to Texas so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit um we moved from Colorado where and i have a closet full of sweaters that	2008	A
you live in Virginia now oh that's interesting	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
uh-huh	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
yeah	2008	A
i'd like to be able to wear those here today it's eighty eight degrees so needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
today was uh definitely a shorts day around here	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
 this is pretty unseasonal- unseasonal but um at least we you know it it it feels good it gets uh everybody doesn't have cabin fever today it's nice to get out and about	2008	A
<silence>	2008	A
okay sounds good was nice talking to you	2008	A
bye-bye	2008	A
	2008	A
<silence>	2085	B
uh i couldn't hear you	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
i'm doing fine i'm just uh	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
editing a spreadsheet right now i'm trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work -until i'm ninety five	2085	B
	2085	B
yeah this-	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
yeah this is a a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because	2085	B
what i'm figuring out is that i'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i'm making	2085	B
	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
what's that	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well	2085	B
we've got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our property's already paid for	2085	B
you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits	2085	B
would be the uh the availability of the health insurance	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
and the availability of uh you know being able to transfer	2085	B
around inside the organization	2085	B
without having you know when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that's working on it like some companies i know of	2085	B
you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
yep	2085	B
what	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
um-hum	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
yeah that's uh that's something i hadn't really thought about since we don't have children	2085	B
but i can see how it would be a real benefit	2085	B
those that do	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
hum	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well that can i can see where that might be important	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
no	2085	B
i i don't know what you're talking about there	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
oh okay yeah yeah we got that pre tax insurance	2085	B
yeah	2085	B
	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
hum	2085	B
oh it's probably what the first guy who did it called it	2085	B
yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it	2085	B
	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
i'll tell you what we could do	2085	B
we could prohibit people from being hired that are	2085	B
historically going to cost the company money	2085	B
you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired	2085	B
because you know if-	2085	B
well not- not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company	2085	B
see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job	2085	B
okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company	2085	B
and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find	2085	B
a a place to put them_1 or b you know boot them_1 out	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
what	2085	B
oh well	2085	B
i'm i'm	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
i know	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well there's two schools of thought on that you know i i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor	2085	B
i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that	2085	B
but	2085	B
once you get that job with the university then you've got ten years of probation	2085	B
then you have tenure	2085	B
and they can't fire you	2085	B
well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry	2085	B
and i've also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
but in addition	2085	B
um-hum	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well they they really can't fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the government's taken care of that	2085	B
but uh what i'm looking at is	2085	B
you know	2085	B
there are a lot of teachers out there that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors	2085	B
you know and i could see a point protecting someone's position	2085	B
but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
in some places they don't but you know you you've got specialized education now	2085	B
for instance take computer science	2085	B
you know we've got kids twenty years old	2085	B
right now that could beat any computer	2085	B
professor at microcomputer applications i know we do	2085	B
and these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches	2085	B
because there's no comprehensive test that they can take	2085	B
that would allow them to step- to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college	2085	B
you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i mean	2085	B
	2085	B
i mean my agree is absolutely worthless	2085	B
it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
Industrial Marketing	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well actually i'm selling computer software	2085	B
but the two are mutually exclusive	2085	B
because the	2085	B
it's experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college	2085	B
not my degree	2085	B
which is i think kind of {bizzaro}	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well let's	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
that's	2085	B
we've already we've already got that	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
um-hum	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well yeah	2085	B
supervisor evaluation's always been a tough one	2085	B
especially in my line because	2085	B
you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check	2085	B
	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
well not really	2085	B
you know i mean it- there's	2085	B
what what's to evaluate -evaluate him on	2085	B
you know i mean	2085	B
uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero	2085	B
i run the whole show	2085	B
and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because_1 he knows that i know what i'm doing	2085	B
you know and uh	2085	B
that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation	2085	B
because so often you know you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
you know it's it's hard for me to you- you know especially since i'm in marketing sales	2085	B
you know i make more than my boss	2085	B
because he's salary and i'm not i make as much as i earn	2085	B
you know if i don't make a sale i don't make anything	2085	B
	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
yeah well it's a little tough	2085	B
but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make	2085	B
but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is	2085	B
you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing	2085	B
they're just there	2085	B
you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they aren't working not that they aren't trying or anything it's just that their jobs are useless	2085	B
<silence>	2085	B
you know take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for	2085	B
Ed Swampers Swampers' a guy who's in the union he's a laborer and he's assigned to	2085	B
hi how are you doing	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
i said how are you doing	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
yeah we've been doing that too we're trying to retire in our fifties	2085	A
	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
good luck on that one then	2085	A
i said good luck on that one then	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
uh-huh	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
so you work for TI then	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
you can't say yep	2085	A
	2085	A
yes you do well i work for DISD and i don't know what you're talking about when you say um health insurance but Dallas doesn't pay it pays most of mine	2085	A
you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know my- i put my kids on my policy it's like two hundred dollars	2085	A
and it's gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point	2085	A
and benefits you know i'd like to see child care paid for or or on-site child- child care sometime	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
i think that would be an excellent idea and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day	2085	A
right	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
well we can shelter also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too you know go on and pay a lump sum	2085	A
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay but if you paid in more than you actually used	2085	A
and the same thing for insurance what you predict you're going to be paying for insurance	2085	A
as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money you're okay but if you pay out	2085	A
less then you lose that money	2085	A
i don't like that part but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
and then we got that cafeteria plan do you have that	2085	A
no you can uh	2085	A
well you let's see it shelters- it shelters you're money that you pay for insurance	2085	A
it takes it out of your salary before taxes	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
okay	2085	A
yeah	2085	A
but we call it the cafeteria plan i wonder why	2085	A
i said i wonder why	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
cafeteria	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
	2085	A
maybe so let's see what else can we do changes	2085	A
what	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
um-hum	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
you mean like for health insurance	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
yeah	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
well that's easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
thank you	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
i said thank you	2085	A
we're both school teachers	2085	A
but it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good	2085	A
it's almost impossible	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
uh-huh	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
uh-huh	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
um-hum	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
right	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago	2085	A
you know for- in the public schools	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
it made you ease- more at ease you know you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
	2085	A
 right	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
well they don't	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
in some places they don't	2085	A
do they	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
you know	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
yeah	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
what did you get your degree in	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
and what's your job now	2085	A
	2085	A
huh	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
maybe	2085	A
all right what else could we change	2085	A
 oh i'd like to see flexible hours and teaching you know shared job sharing	2085	A
more of that	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
well see we've got a little bit of it but not much	2085	A
and it'd be nice if your you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
what else i'd like to be able to to evaluate your boss	2085	A
and it really carry some weight and you get to choose your boss	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
huh	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
well so you get to evaluate him though why not	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
no	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
yeah	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
yeah	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
	2085	A
	2085	A
<silence>	2085	A
<silence>	2001	A
hi um yeah i'd like to talk about how you dress for work and and um what do you normally what type of outfit do you normally have to wear	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
um-hum	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
and is	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
right right is there is there um any- is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask	2001	A
right	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
 right	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like depending on what you think you'll be doing that day	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
right	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
yes	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
yeah yeah well it- it- that's right and it	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um in- in engineering and and it was it was a casual office there was no formal dress code but	2001	A
um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it just in case things would come up during the day sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and wanna see you	2001	A
uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk all day and nobody would see you um	2001	A
uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and uh and uh anyway um right now i'm- i'm not i'm not there but but anyway	2001	A
um and season- really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather you know uh wear light clothing i guess if it's hot out but um	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
that's	2001	A
that's true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh you have a little bit more variety maybe- maybe lighter cotton clothing in the summer and woolens in the winter whereas the	2001	A
	2001	A
 that's that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those that- not really-	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
right	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
oh i see uh-huh	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
okay and and	2001	A
and also like the um also the the all the supporting kind of stuff secretaries and clerks and things are they also they have same similar similar- yeah	2001	A
yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like they- they were much there was much more casual dress although i don't think everybody looked at that you know as a good thing	2001	A
right	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
yeah	2001	A
yeah and	2001	A
that's right	2001	A
<silence>	2001	A
yeah that's true and um hm well that's it	2001	A
yeah i don't know what else- what more we can say about that that's	2001	A
oh it's been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh okay all right nice talking to you bye-bye	2001	A
	2001	A
okay hi	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice so i usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time slacks i guess and in the summer just dresses	2001	B
we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often	2001	B
so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of you know always the same temperature	2001	B
so	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
 not formally	2001	B
but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit nice a lot of times we have to go over to uh like Jerry Junkins' office and Bill Ellsworth's office to deliver stuff	2001	B
and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin and Bill so we have to dress a little bit nice we're not	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
yes now you know if if everybody- like in August when everybody's on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual or	2001	B
ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but i guess that would have to do with the weather but um	2001	B
unless it's an extremely- you know an unusual day	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
um-hum	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
yeah	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
um-hum	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
right	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
yeah or um-hum what area do you work in	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
um	2001	B

<silence>	2001	B
	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
it with the	2001	B
yeah	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
but then usually in the summer it's cold in the offices because_1 the air conditioner's doing its job so well	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
oh yeah	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
it	2001	B
uh-huh just suits and there's not a whole lot of fabric variance there and they can't have a rayon suit so	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
not really i think i mean it's kind of unwritten but i think we're supposed to wear hose and and shoes you know most of the people do anyway	2001	B
uh most of the women wear uh most- actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else	2001	B
but i'm not in that professional of a position so i don't i'm not expected to do that	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
um-hum	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
 yes pretty much i'm a secretary yeah	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
yeah- yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down that might be discrimination or something i don't know i mean i've never been told what to wear or what not to wear	2001	B
it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine	2001	B
you know what i feel a comfortable in you don't wanna stand out too much	2001	B
<silence>	2001	B
	2001	B

and what do you think you'll do with that	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
um-hum	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
and i mean	2092	B
you want to get into some kind of manufacturing or or what's the specialty that you're looking for	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
oh okay so you want to find a uh data transmissions you're looking for uh	2092	B
um	2092	B
long distance	2092	B
type stuff	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah i have uh wife and two children and uh and-	2092	B
no she doesn't work she does uh well it's kind of hard to say now days uh other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself and she gets paid for that so she brings some money in	2092	B
she's trying to start her- her own business where she does that full time uh alterations and sewing and stuff for the public and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
	2092	B
and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget so	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
oh sure we're like everybody else you know you we've got a uh	2092	B
several credit cards that sometimes uh	2092	B
instead of paying them all off at every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time you know that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah but something that you can use	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
that's very uh utilitarian you know	2092	B
you make those things there are no no frivolous gifts	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
that's true why bother yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
well especially being a college student you your i don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know that effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time it's the end of the semester you've got finals and you've got lots of bills i would suspect	2092	B
what about when you have breaks like uh Christmas or between sessions	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
i expect so	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
you've got to budget that though you've got to save up in able to do that right	2092	B
i mean	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
	2092	B
yeah	2092	B
right right	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
right	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
hm	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
sure it is any time you can get away and and get away from from the daily grind	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
yeah i know the feeling	2092	B
<silence>	2092	B
is that okay	2092	B
all right	2092	B
oh	2092	B
nice talking to you have a good time bye	2092	B
	2092	B
	2092	A
well the thing is is that uh since i'm in school i don't like basically have a monthly budget because i'm living off my dad	2092	A
	2092	A
but the thing is is that um i have to keep it under control because for example you know it's like the the beginning of the semester when you go- have to pay for everything	2092	A
everything's pretty rough but he controls that part but then whenever you know it's like once the semester start i'm the one who has to control how much spending there is	2092	A
and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food and uh so	2092	A
well the thing is is that i live in a dorm	2092	A
so uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts and the the tuition is also the same thing	2092	A
so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries and that's about it	2092	A
but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it's like i can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars uh you know three times a week	2092	A
so i mean it's for for us you know it's like i- i can spend i can spend that money but it's not it's not what i want to spend it on you know	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
no because um they don't allow me to work since uh i'm a foreign student	2092	A
and so they the government doesn't allow me to work	2092	A
uh-huh	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
well the thing is is that um i basically- i basically know how much i have right	2092	A
and so the thing is is that	2092	A
i i can tell like uh i get all my money out of the teller	2092	A
and besides see one- one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international	2092	A
Argentina yeah	2092	A
and so the basic- one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills	2092	A
well that's they want- they want me to call down there every so often i mean- i told my dad listen- dad listen if you want to save money i won't call so often you know he goes we want to keep in touch so it doesn't matter about the money because_1 we need to hear from you	2092	A
no because it's more expensive that way uh any any uh basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of	2092	A
and uh because it's considered luxury in other countries	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
right since it's his money anyway you know	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
no uh i got money to pay that too	2092	A
so it's basically you know it's like it's not too much money and it's not too little money so i won't have to you know rush a letter to him or something because uh he really wants me to concentrate on my studies	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
i'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
with those degrees	2092	A
well i can i can work up uh here up to a year	2092	A
and hopefully get a job after that	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
uh computer communications and data transmissions	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
right	2092	A
yeah you know anywhere from uh local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that and and so well you have a family right	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
and does does your wife work	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
oh okay	2092	A
yeah	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
okay	2092	A
yeah	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
and so and you have a monthly budget	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
right	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
so you don't have any problem in uh overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
yeah yeah	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
well then uh see uh that's that's one of the points which i don't	2092	A
see like i i don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas and i you know i don't want- i don't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it's like if i want something i'll i'll ask somebody you know like	2092	A
like my- uh for Christmas- for Christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want and i said i want a backpack	2092	A
you know uh no i told him you if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack	2092	A
right because i i needed a backpack so he gave me a backpack and i i knew he needed an alarm clock so i bought him an alarm clock so the thing was that that	2092	A
right but	2092	A
right but uh thing is especially i mean when i was down Argentina it was to me was ridiculous because you know you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you don't care about you know it's like	2092	A
yeah and so but the thing is is that um	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
yeah	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
yeah yeah	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
well for example we had spring break now and i went skiing and i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars or	2092	A
so uh but you know its like uh	2092	A
<silence>	2092	A
yeah yeah because it's like you know say you know it's like we're saying let's go eat out before spring break i go let's not go eat out before spring break let's see how much money we have afterwards	2092	A
and if i felt like i spent way too much then uh i won't go out you know	2092	A
and so like my roommate went home i went skiing in uh over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything	2092	A
	2092	A
but um	2092	A
but it was you know it was i guess it was worth it you know it was a nice place	2092	A
yeah yeah	2092	A
yeah especially if you live on campus and you don't have a car you just go crazy	2092	A
so oh well let's see how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half okay yeah	2092	A
all right well nice talking to you all right bye-bye	2092	A
	2092	A
	2093	A
i guess i'm going to school while i'm uh working at TI so there's not a whole lot of time that i've got uh for hobbies seems like lately	2093	A
but one of one the things that i do when i've got some spare time is and i do some woodworking and that oh i guess ranges anywhere from uh	2093	A
carpentry work to uh uh some types of furniture and uh oh i don't know what you would call them_1 knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall and to put a mirror on and	2093	A
i made some uh candle sconces that you hang on the	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
there's something about working with wood that that i enjoy that i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but you know	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
yeah because_1 it's it's out there you know i don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust and the wife gets kind of aggravated at that but then i get the opportunity to vacuum	2093	A
so i guess i get some- some of both uh what are some of your things you like to do	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
yeah	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
oh yeah	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
yeah it's a good time for gardening	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
i could do with a little less wind but i think the the temperature's been pretty good so far for working outside	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
do you find you do most of your your uh crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
yeah	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
well that's kind of what my wife says she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because_1 she's always got something to cover her legs- her legs and feet with while she's working on it	2093	A
i know seems like she i think she made three this year one for uh my father-in-law and and then a couple of brothers and sisters so uh she- those things they take some time to make	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
oh that's kind of like quilting	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
i think the	2093	A
mile a minute	2093	A
well i'm not sure what she does i i first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because_1 she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan	2093	A
i guess that's your standard knitting isn't it	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
yeah	2093	A
i know	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
oh okay	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
 call instead of call waiting or call anything else	2093	A
	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
well i guess that that's one way to end a conversation	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
yeah what uh have you started your garden yet	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
um boy	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
oh yeah always got to have those	2093	A
i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year i think one of them_1 died but i i got	2093	A
so- you know i put them_1 i chop them_1 up and put them_1 in jars and usually give them_1 away because_1 i don't- there's no way that i can eat all those and nobody else in the family likes them_1 but always got to keep those planted	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
well that's kind of the way i am um	2093	A
i planted uh zucchini last year uh i planted four hills of them_1 i think i had three or four seeds- seeds in each one of them_1	2093	A
and those things just flat took over um it wasn't -until late	2093	A
i guess in the summer	2093	A
maybe it was because_1 it was too dry they finally started making zucchini and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if if they should be planted early or later it seems like all i got was	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
i would think so um seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit so i don't know if i'm mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon you know but i don't	2093	A
i hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
it may not be it may not be	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
you think they are later in the year	2093	A
uh	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
well that's true mostly okra that's grown around here is is later okra	2093	A
<silence>	2093	A
well that's about_1 uh	2093	A
go ahead well i was just going to say we it's a little over six or seven minutes so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well i'm um that'd be fine	2093	A
well all right i guess we'll call this one quits and thanks for participating	2093	A
all right have a good time	2093	A
bye	2093	A
	2093	A
<silence>	2093	B
yeah i have quite a few of those that my uncle made	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
 i think it's more like the mess you make isn't it and you don't have to worry about cleaning it up	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
well when i have time i do like to sew um i had been doing a lot of crocheting i make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them	2093	B
my mother was real heavy into crafts and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing and then she would go to these uh arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework	2093	B
so a lot of times i'd help her with that i haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
oh yeah it's been beautiful this last week but	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
i usually start in the fall	2093	B
and my husband says i do it you know make afghans so i can keep my lap warm	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah i found one that's real easy it's- it's um	2093	B
um um shoot i can't even remember the name of it now but you make it in strips and it's real easy to do and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that but it's	2093	B
yeah yeah	2093	B
Mile a Minute that's the name of it	2093	B
Mile a Minute	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah yeah usually single crochet would is is always starts it off	2093	B
if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other don't worry about it we have a a very small phone company down here	2093	B
and my husband says that's called rinky-dink	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
no no we can't have that down here we get disconnected all the time	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah well it gets a little aggravating i've got kids all over the United States and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when i'm talking to them	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yes we planted um potatoes and onions and bell peppers	2093	B
uh	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
what else did i get in there and jalapeno peppers	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah oh my husband doesn't like them either but i can always give them away	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
besides they're fun to grow	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
supposedly after the soil warms up	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
um-hum	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
i- i doubt if zucchini is in there	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
probably the same time the the other squash is though	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah	2093	B
about the same time that you plant okra because_1 it's supposed to be warm	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
yeah	2093	B
we decided this year i'm sorry go ahead	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
oh just anytime	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
all right well i've enjoyed talking to you	2093	B
okay bye	2093	B
<silence>	2093	B
	2093	B
okay	2024	A
	2024	A
uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
oh	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
right i've read that one too i only had a subscription once but my mother always gave me hers and i- i really enjoyed you know all the little	2024	A
things that you find out about Texas	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
uh-huh	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
uh-huh	2024	A
well um i have an interest in art so i frequently purchase and read um books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment	2024	A
 and um	2024	A
oh i guess i like a variety of things um lots of fiction uh type	2024	A
books	2024	A
um right now i'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and it's history that's fairly interesting	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah i- i don't know that i read anything strictly labeled self-improvement how about_1 you	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
uh-huh	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
right	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah yeah well i guess- maybe i am into some things occasionally that i don't think of in terms of self-improvement	2024	A
i mean they are but i don't label it as such	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
well i don't know um	2024	A
i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them_1 but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things but um they would	2024	A
be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know getting- getting your yourself in gear to	2024	A
uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really wanna do convincing you that you need to get on with it	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
 yes	2024	A
sure	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
um	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah yeah	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in a lot at work	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other but i think sometimes the word is a little over used but	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah yeah	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
yeah	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
okay well any other comments	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
	2024	A
well we just started right	2024	A
<silence>	2024	A
well you too and uh	2024	A
good-bye	2024	A
 good-bye	2024	A
	2024	A
<silence>	2024	B
wonderful touch tone telephone there	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide um	2024	B
 i get a charge out of uh Texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh	2024	B
about the different areas of of the kind- of the state by reading it	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
oh yeah it's it's uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things it's pretty pretty neat	2024	B
um oh i like photography um magazines i don't take a subscription or anything like that um	2024	B
things oh	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and	2024	B
and uh kind of strange because i'll it's not unusual to uh see um an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then i'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it but uh how about_1 yourself	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
um-hum	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
 oh that's great	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
um-hum	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
i bet that would be rather interesting uh	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
that's uh self-improvement that's that's always- well that's that's kind of a hobby but it is self-improvement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
 um	2024	B
well i hate to yes i do	2024	B
	2024	B
we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes then and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was	2024	B
 At America's Service by Carl Albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the TI culture here at Texas Instruments	2024	B
um one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is	2024	B
 uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer i'm your customer sort of thing um	2024	B
every now and then i'm loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh	2024	B
better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type	2024	B
actually which all you know betters yourself	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
um-hum	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
 like what for example	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
um-hum	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
sure	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
sure how about items like um The One Minute Manager which used to be a big okay so those are self improvements um	2024	B
our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called What Every Supervisor Should Know	2024	B
by a main man named uh Doctor Bittel B I T T E L and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people	2024	B
and the very last chapter and i haven't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers	2024	B
so it's it's very- it's interesting here again it's it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff and it's really uh excellent fast reading and uh	2024	B
but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know i think if somebody wants to say -okay read these ten books because_1 these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them_1	2024	B
he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and uh picked up one of them_1 it might be a little more interesting	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
yeah they're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and course they're always a little spookier than the movies but uh	2024	B
it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them_1 i have a hard time finishing books	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
um-hum	2024	B
in quality -especially nowadays uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways of the-	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
exactly exactly right	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
 yeah we- we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what- what it is we're saying i think it's it's focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh	2024	B
that's kind of part of it	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
uh not that i can think of um i think i'm under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two	2024	B
ah this is true i've enjoyed it	2024	B
have-	2024	B
<silence>	2024	B
have a good day bye-bye	2024	B
	2024	B
<silence>	2005	B
well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know for- and for their uh you know for their own good	2005	B
i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had to- place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about uh	2005	B
uh six- eight months ago i guess	2005	B
and uh we were i was fortunate in that	2005	B
i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown	2005	B
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there's well i had an occasion for my uh mother-in-law who	2005	B
had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience uh	2005	B
it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out	2005	B
and it was really not not very good uh	2005	B
deal we were not really happy with the	2005	B
nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again	2005	B
but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it	2005	B
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available course there's you know there's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
hm	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B

<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B
yep	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
you were very fortunate	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B
absolutely unfortunately- unfortunately at a lot of times it	2005	B
responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know	2005	B
and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing we were uh lucky- i was lucky too that i only have my- one brother	2005	B
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done	2005	B
my mother also was very very independent she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty three	2005	B
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on	2005	B
that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of course she would she would not have been happy there at all but uh as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum um-hum	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B
that's great	2005	B

<silence>	2005	B
oh yes	2005	B
that's right um-hum	2005	B
yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a whole lot of areas -because people are of course population is getting older you know	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B

<silence>	2005	B
yes	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
 yeah yeah just because they're grandparents just- yeah just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them_1 a good child carer	2005	B

um-hum	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
oh yeah sure realistically it is yes	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
that would certainly help yeah	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
um-hum	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
right that's just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway	2005	B
i think your right	2005	B
<silence>	2005	B
okay was good talking to you yeah take care bye-bye	2005	B
	2005	B
okay uh first um i need to know uh how- how do you feel about uh about sending um an elderly uh family member to a nursing home	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yes yeah	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
um-hum	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yes	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
um-hum yeah probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months and um	2005	A
she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh Parkinson's Disease and it got so much that she could not take care of her house she- then she lived in an apartment and um	2005	A
that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change of	2005	A
change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling i mean she traveled- she had she had children all across the United States and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children	2005	A
and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself	2005	A
yeah i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh	2005	A
not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines and you know facing that situation it it's quite a dilemma i think	2005	A
yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision	2005	A
than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family	2005	A
getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then	2005	A
finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home	2005	A
and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean it i mean i i i i hardly- i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah yeah well we we yeah	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
um-hum	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
um-hum	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah yeah well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with	2005	A
	2005	A
she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter came and visited her and also her uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday	2005	A
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest	2005	A
um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for her	2005	A
and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i i didn't- i don't know how i would how i would deal if if one of my parents came with with Alzheimer's or something like that which is which is far more devastating	2005	A
and um	2005	A
i i think- i think that what one thing that was- that they were really concerned with probably was the fact	2005	A
it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care that the people that work there were very	2005	A
were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the	2005	A
what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment that's the that's probably the major question	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah	2005	A
yeah	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the United States is changing because	2005	A
you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time	2005	A
um in- matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families it wasn't but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation	2005	A
we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier	2005	A
uh	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family	2005	A
you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things even- even- even child care you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not	2005	A
	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people	2005	A
especially where they've had uh extended family and i and and- i i kind of see that that you know perhaps	2005	A
you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know i mean uh it's	2005	A
money seems to be too big of an issue with- with with with with with what's going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be	2005	A
you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problems i mean i mean we may not we may not have as high a standard of living but	2005	A
the quality- but actually have a truer standard of living	2005	A
<silence>	2005	A
yeah yeah	2005	A
yeah	2005	A
	2005	A
okay well	2005	A
i guess that was it	2005	A
	2005	A
okay all right hey bye-bye	2005	A
	2005	A
	2022	A
okay so um yes we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a	2022	A
computer here at the house and i made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month	2022	A
and then basically since then what i've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on	2022	A
whatever we've got coming in check coming in and how much i'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spend-	2022	A
and because_1 our house payment is once a month that's our our biggest uh expense so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though it's really still there	2022	A
so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month what do y'all do	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
um-hum is it is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
um-hum and and you're staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
yeah i found-	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
um-hum	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
yeah	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
you don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and and do that	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
yeah	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
that's a good choice we've been trying we're trying to uh do that this year we've budgeted	2022	A
the money that we used to spend we were spending on a CODA account with TI and then money we were also buying stock with for that year we've taken that this year and said we're gonna pay off all of our credit cards and uh	2022	A
we have a another loan with the bank and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we'll be free and clear	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
yeah	2022	A
that's good to be in that kind of shape what are y'all trying to do long term	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
uh-huh	2022	A
	2022	A
yeah mostly what we're doing we've worked we've done the uh CODA account with TI where they we put in so much a month and then they or so much a paycheck and then they match it	2022	A
 and so that that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for TI and i have when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an IRA and we had an out	2022	A
we had an existing IRA so we have both of us have some money in an IRA that we're also trying to figure to	2022	A
put it we're putting it in CDs right now and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund	2022	A
 um-hum	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
yeah the other thing that we've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um	2022	A
 Hancock- oh John Hancock company came out and their agents did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were planning- what	2022	A
what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kid's college paying off the house buying a different house	2022	A
um special thing buying land and building our own house and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at	2022	A
and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in at what time	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
um-hum	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
um-hum	2022	A
yeah that	2022	A
that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me	2022	A
that's a a big thing to think about	2022	A
	2022	A
um-hum	2022	A
	2022	A
yeah	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
okay	2022	A
	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
i guess that's most of my um financial plans right now is is there anything you'd like to add	2022	A
<silence>	2022	A
-okay well it's been nice talking to you	2022	A
bye-bye	2022	A
	2022	A
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
a running total	2022	B
yeah	2022	B
uh we've we've uh taken how much we have you know write down how much	2022	B
we have coming in each month and then uh we've at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend we sat down- made up different accounts like	2022	B
you know we've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and	2022	B
entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close we've you know we we try to stay within a certain budget so	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it but it it works out real well so	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
yeah yeah i stay within- i have to stay within it so i	2022	B
you know and then we have that you know if you can't stay if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something and something- unexpected- unexpected comes up then you're not	2022	B
	2022	B
you know you don't feel it so strapped	2022	B
right yeah because_1 we don't you know we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh <b_aside> you got paper under your table <e_aside>	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
to be out of debt	2022	B
free	2022	B
yeah the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment and that's the only thing we ever we try to stay out of debt so	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh oh as long term we just he has- you know his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that that's all we've and you know we just have our life insurance for right now	2022	B
so we don't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now so	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
yeah that's what we're doing so	2022	B
yeah	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
yeah whenever we get enough saved we we stick it in a CD for a while and then uh	2022	B
you know and then when we if we need it we wait till it it's expired and then so	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
or not yeah	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
uh-huh that sounds interesting we've never done anything- we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know and he's set up uh you know determined how much we need to	2022	B
you know we need if something were to happen	2022	B
you know	2022	B
yeah	2022	B
<silence>	2022	B
right yeah you- you know if i would sell the you know if he something would happen to him i wouldn't stay in Texas i would uh	2022	B

	2039	B
<silence>	2039	A
oh yes yes very much	2039	A
as a matter of fact i prefer public television	2039	A
and uh i have particularly enjoy the	2039	A
English comedies	2039	A
and the	2039	A
English mysteries	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
yes	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
vociferously	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
yes	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television	2039	A
and i i'm not a great television watcher in in any respect uh but uh	2039	A
the	2039	A
watching what i do watch is uh	2039	A
usually news and whatever is on public television uh any kind of i also uh	2039	A
am very fond of great performances in in that regard	2039	A
but uh	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
no uh no uh no as a matter of fact	2039	A
uh Turner Broadcasting	2039	A
has been uh broadcasting	2039	A
all of the James Bond movies	2039	A
every night this week so i have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
well they're showing uh Live and Let Die at this moment and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as 007	2039	A
so it it	2039	A
no no that's true i was just thinking that today he well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in the early movies whereas uh Sean Connery has maintained the	2039	A
i how would you ruddy uh look uh but uh	2039	A
oh yes yes	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
 well you know he was uh	2039	A
when was it last year or year before last	2039	A
he was voted	2039	A
the	2039	A
sexiest actor in movies or something	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
 i mean the man is sixty two years old if	2039	A
but uh otherwise you know we uh with you know PBS and so forth and i i particularly enjoy i don't know whether you've whether you had a chance to watch it on PBS but uh	2039	A
the series uh Yes Minister	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
that was about a the interior minister- it was a comedy the interior minister of uh in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
um-hum	2039	A
um-hum	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
yeah	2039	A
yeah i know well i i'd	2039	A
i as i said i'm not much of a television watcher i read as i said and uh quite a bit i i read about	2039	A
two or three novels a week	2039	A
in addition to all the technical stuff what do- what what do you do what kind of work do you do	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
at TI	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
oh i see	2039	A
um-hum well the last two people who have called both worked for TI and i just wondered huh	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
um-hum	2039	A
 i guess yeah i- i guess we all can	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
no no i work for GTE	2039	A
in Maryland yes	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
well that i guess it it doesn't-	2039	A
how did i hear about it well i work you know they're gathering a database for voice processing and that's my field of of work also	2039	A
so i i know the people at TI who are doing this and i heard about it so i called them_1 and ask if i could- could participate and uh	2039	A
you know sent in the forms etcetera and uh so forth	2039	A
	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
yes i have	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
well no that's it you could interpret it that way	2039	A
uh	2039	A
i think	2039	A
what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of	2039	A
historical truth	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
but the interpretation that	2039	A
actually got into the um	2039	A
the writing of the Bible itself is probably	2039	A
uh after the what uh was it the King James Version when the committee	2039	A
uh	2039	A
did it wrote- wrote the uh the or translation that so much was lost in the translation uh particularly since most of the translations- most of the translations were from Greek	2039	A
uh well for example uh in Greek there are seven different words for love	2039	A
okay so you can have there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know love- uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing	2039	A
so in those translations- those types of interpretations uh	2039	A
really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it says so that you know it's it you know you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical	2039	A
fact involved just from the	2039	A
uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available	2039	A
to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it	2039	A
you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that	2039	A
it isn't true then you can you very much look at it that way	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
	2039	A
but uh i as as far as that goes i at- we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard but uh	2039	A
i don't know if there's a there is a time limit on this so uh	2039	A
i think so too all right well it's been very pleasant talking to you	2039	A
and have a good evening	2039	A
good night	2039	A
<silence>	2039	A
	2039	A
<silence>	2017	B
okay	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
oh	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
okay um well i've lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years	2017	B
and we're in our second home now we've been in it for uh about thirteen fourteen years i think now in Richardson	2017	B
	2017	B
we've lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
	2017	B
well it's it's not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano so uh the uh the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are are about the same {pricewise} i would think	2017	B
yeah so	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
yeah	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
yeah well um	2017	B
 i know i i think that there's some areas in you know in uh Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but uh of course it like i said i've it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a house so	2017	B
 so i'm not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that our price- that the the value of our house went up you know considerably over- over a you know uh oh an eight or ten year period	2017	B
but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so	2017	B
but uh we've done uh you know in order to maintain ours we've done some remodeling and stuff you know just to to kind of change do some some little changes occasionally so	2017	B
uh but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm a CPA and i was just talking to one of my clients uh yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days	2017	B
and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced it's uh in Dallas but it's in the Richardson School District	2017	B
and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she want's- you know thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so	2017	B
so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on the on the down side right now	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
well i'm not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice	2017	B
because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that	2017	B
but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house so it's our fault but we had them_1 put the shower on a corner uh like our house is built in a U shape	2017	B
and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that shower is	2017	B
and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that that that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house	2017	B
and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it's soaking up in the Sheetrock or in things right	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
yeah uh but uh	2017	B
yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location Richardson Plano are probably comparable the the school districts are you know are about the same uh you know quality wise	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
yeah so	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
um-hum	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
	2017	B
yeah but uh well our house and i'm not sure how all of the builders- you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation	2017	B
and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete	2017	B
and makes it more uh stable- more stable and and puts more strength into it	2017	B
so uh you know it it	2017	B
	2017	B
uh potentially that's supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the the earth itself shifts around so	2017	B
yeah so	2017	B
	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
um-hum	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
yeah	2017	B
right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam	2017	B
	2017	B
yeah so that's and that's what ours is our house- the house we had before was over we live on the east side of Richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house	2017	B
and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so	2017	B
yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if you've got a if you have a good builder	2017	B
	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
yeah	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
okay	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
	2017	B
	2017	B
right yeah that would	2017	B
okay thank you uh	2017	B
<silence>	2017	B
okay thank you you too	2017	B
	2017	B
<silence>	2017	A

<silence>	2017	A
uh-huh	2017	A

<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
well what do you find having to be like out there i've always heard that it was expensive	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
oh really	2017	A
hm	2017	A
well we uh when we graduated from school in Houston uh my husband went- went to school at Rice and got his PhD so that that's what brought us here and um we had um	2017	A
heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
yes	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
really	2017	A
hm	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
yes	2017	A
well that makes sense	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
hm	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
oh that's good	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
	2017	A
well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
hm	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
uh-huh	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
yes	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
so did it look cracked to you i mean that's how you knew it was broken or	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
oh	2017	A
oh so that's that's how you knew well since like i say we're first time homeowners i'm still scared about everything like that going wrong and how do you know it's going to happen and all	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
we really like our school out here	2017	A
but we um	2017	A
we were scared to buy a an house	2017	A
	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
hm	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a nineteen sixty three	2017	A
house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
it's slab	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
um-hum	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
well that's good	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so	2017	A
well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um it's got a really good reputation and	2017	A
<silence>	2017	A
	2017	A
fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well um you good- good luck with this program then bye-bye	2017	A
	2017	A
	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
uh on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four	2014	B
i'm not totally i'm not	2014	B
one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i don't think we should be carrying Uzis either you know what i mean yeah i know i mean i don't think machine guns automatic weapons i don't believe in things like that but i think	2014	B
that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose and- but i think there should be some restrictions when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
yeah	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
no they don't they don't ask anything except how old you are i don't think that's kind of scary	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
uh-huh	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
yeah they might be or you know how we are here in Texas it's like everybody's a hunter so i'm not much of a hunter but	2014	B
	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be be the people who are gonna kill you anyway	2014	B
yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them_1 one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so	2014	B
and they're illegal so i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
right	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
that's true	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them_1 too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them_1	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until you've taken this course sign up here something like that	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
right exactly before graduation	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
yep	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they they don't see any sense in it at all	2014	B
they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course they're hunters they know what they're doing they don't realize there're a bunch of crazy people out there that	2014	B
don't use it for that well yeah that's true they shoot each other thinking they're a deer yeah darn i thought you were a deer Bob sorry my mistake	2014	B
looked like antlers i don't know	2014	B
	2014	B
yep that happens a lot too	2014	B
<silence>	2014	B
but i guess that's it	2014	B
that's my opinion on it so what now	2014	B
uh	2014	B
uh i think we just hang up yeah okay thanks bye	2014	B
	2014	A
uh how do you feel about gun control	2014	A

 some people do i know	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A
right	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A
yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they don't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A
 i'm from California my mom- the last time i was like purchased a gun my my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one and	2014	A

 yeah	2014	A
 it's	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A
	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A

right	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A
right right	2014	A
	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A
no i yeah i- i- i- i- i agree that it would be like people in	2014	A
 people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them_1 and then you have no defense against these people when they do come into your house or something	2014	A
<silence>	2014	A

<silence>	2053	B
um-hum	2053	B
<silence>	2053	B
right i see well now can i	2053	B

because a lot of them_1 are are similar	2053	B
<silence>	2053	B
good grief yeah there's there's lots of pinks and and greens	2053	B

Rangers have got a new guy this year i don't remember his name either	2078	B
<silence>	2078	B

<silence>	2078	B
yeah but sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun	2078	B
yeah	2078	B
it is	2078	B
<silence>	2078	B
and and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there	2078	B
yeah that that huge it's suppose to be a huge stadium and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it and uh they're going to try to make it a real community center out there	2078	B
of course	2078	B
<silence>	2078	B
that's that's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play	2078	B
and they're never going to let liquor in there	2078	B
i know but they try every year and every year they get thrown out	2078	B
it's so stupid because_1 they let you take it in there but they don't they don't allow you to sell it don't allow them to sell it there	2078	B
<silence>	2078	B
but uh that new stadium's going to be real nice and i heard that there's uh	2078	B

<silence>	2078	B
real hard	2078	B
yeah i would think it	2078	B
<silence>	2078	B
yeah	2078	B
that's typical bureaucracy though that's that's i think it's going to be any where you go it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones i don't know sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad	2078	B
<silence>	2078	B
yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes	2078	B

<silence>	2078	A
okay so hers was the first one i got	2078	A

oh she was telling me all her problems	2078	A
and it went over ten minutes	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
well yeah we did but the topic was boring i thought what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
oh yeah i could go on and on about that	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
ooh neat	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
no	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
the last one i saw was Dances Of The With The Wolves Of The Wolves	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
oh i enjoyed it i mean it was just more for my money	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
huh	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
uh-huh	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
one is eight and one is eleven	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
they usually pick their own	2078	A
you know they've got it all figured out	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
well and Ninja Turtles	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
but most of the time really we watch them on the video	2078	A
don't you just massive rental	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
going to	2078	A
i know	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
that's what we do especially when it's bad weather man just	2078	A
plug it in	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
i know	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
it's good when you go to Tom Thumb though and they're cheap and nobody's got them_1 yet unbelievable	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
uh-huh	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
do you read	2078	A
no	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
you saw Field Of the Dreams right a long time ago	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
so i was reading the book and it's called Shoeless Joe	2078	A
it was so wonderful and then i was um i decided well i like this author so i got a uh book of his short stories and that's been real good	2078	A
don't don't ask me The Ghost Of Shoeless Joe was the name of the book	2078	A
yes quite a quite a bit but you know in the movie the guy was black	2078	A
he wasn't in the book	2078	A
that's one difference	2078	A
there really wasn't a lot of difference	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
um-hum	2078	A
so	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
well do you think we've covered baseball	2078	A
<silence>	2078	A
 okay well have a good night-	2078	A
	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either	2015	A
offering a service or	2015	A
they're introducing some new product in the area and	2015	A
normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours	2015	A
and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall	2015	A
and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on	2015	A
or you hear somebody already starting reading- reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
even had some of them_1 the	2015	A
they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
what i would love to see done to stop all of this	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything	2015	A
but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them_1	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
i put a stop to some of them_1 as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people	2015	A
peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman- salesman to come out	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
now i agree with their right to um	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment	2015	A
i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them_1 otherwise i don't want to know they exist	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in	2015	A
i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed- i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because_1 i still get	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment	2015	A
but i consider invasion of my privacy	2015	A
a harassment in itself	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
i believe we've pretty much summed everything up	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
i'm drawing the blank	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you	2015	A
<silence>	2015	A
and take it easy now good night	2015	A
	2015	A
	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
yes yes	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
that is that one that you were talking about	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
um-hum	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
that's true or the ones that are are generated by a computer it's just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really really hate too	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i- i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them_1 and most of them_1 aren't from anybody at all	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
uh-huh	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
um-hum	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them_1 are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand	2015	B
so yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy	2015	B
i agree with you on that particular subject there	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
let me see	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
um-hum	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
um-hum um-hum	2015	B
yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations	2015	B
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization	2015	B
 and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago	2015	B
 and um gosh it was about_1 nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what i would consider you know a family hour it's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints	2015	B
and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
um-hum	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
right	2015	B
yeah yeah no i- i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either	2015	B
and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work	2015	B
and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations	2015	B
and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
 yeah yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i don't have a storm door but i'm sure i could rig up something	2015	B
but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like they- they see that word and it says uh go	2015	B
 instead of stop	2015	B
oh goodness	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
	2015	B
oh gosh	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
yeah yeah	2015	B
yeah yeah yeah that's true that's true	2015	B
hm well what else	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think	2015	B
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
and i can't remember what it was	2015	B
and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door	2015	B
<silence>	2015	B
	2015	B
oh goodness okay is our five minutes up	2015	B
pretty close-	2015	B
well it was nice talking to you too Jim	2015	B
okay thanks bye	2015	B
	2015	B
okay um i don't know about you but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next	2027	B
it's pretty bad but it's true you know they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know	2027	B
we you know we hire these wonderful creative people and we don't want to smush their creativity you know we want to go ahead and let them_1 do what ever they want and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
yeah	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
yeah- yeah you know we're kind of that way too i try to i'm the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and	2027	B
and you know if i know that they're gonna be there you know you- you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they're not	2027	B
	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
uh	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
uh-huh	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh no	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
uh-huh	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh no	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh how awful sounds like Mister Power Hungry but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts	2027	B
and i don't care you can call them_1 split skirts and you can call them_1 culottes all you want	2027	B
but these were shorts is all they were i mean i- i don't care what else you call them_1 you know if they're below the knee okay maybe you can call them_1 split skirts if they're above the knee they turn into shorts you know and these weren't even really	2027	B
full ones i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know and because_1 these weren't even those these were like	2027	B
pretty short black and they were very dressy they were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice	2027	B
but you don't wear shorts to work you know i mean as far as i'm concerned she was in violation and nobody says anything to them_1 it's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime you know if they just you know the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an	2027	B
cut off you know that yeah no this is where we're going to draw the line this is shorts you know and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know	2027	B
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
yeah	2027	B
uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them_1 doesn't make them_1 not shorts anymore you know	2027	B
i mean i've never seen them_1 do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still it's they're shorts i don't care what you say they're shorts you know well i think TI's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh do they really	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh my God	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
i could- i couldn't afford to work there	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh no	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
uh-huh	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
	2027	B
wow	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
i don't know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i	2027	B
i see i- i am more i don't know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say i'm nuts but i am more productive when i'm in pants	2027	B
i- i am i work faster i get things done faster than when i'm in a dress and heels you know i it and it's weird but i it's i do i i can i can get so much more done if i'm dressed comfortable you know	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
right	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
yeah	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
uh-huh	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
you can't do that in a skirt poor thing	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh yuck	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
yeah that's terrible that's terrible gosh	2027	B
well i don't know i just figure	2027	B
you know yeah sometimes i worry about	2027	B
you know if i go in in pants and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know but i'll go in in pants i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a and a like a peach colored top and you know not	2027	B
cruddy but not a dress either and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you don't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if	2027	B
you know if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on but you know i don't know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans so you know	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
really wow	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
uh-huh	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
yeah	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
 isn't that funny	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
that's great	2027	B
	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
yeah	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
that's the way to do it i mean that's the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit	2027	B
it's gonna make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know or it would me you know	2027	B
yeah yeah look at this slick guy i wonder what kind of money does he make uh-huh i can see it now well it was good to talk to you it was really enjoyable	2027	B
it really is	2027	B
<silence>	2027	B
oh yuck yeah well it's kind of enjoyable i'm really looking forward to it well thanks a lot bye-bye	2027	B
	2027	B
<silence>	2027	A
 were-	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
well i'm kind of that way too i work in the legal department and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents	2027	A
and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like i'm doing that and i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry	2027	A
you know boxes of documents around so if i'm just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if we're going to have a meeting	2027	A
where we're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up yeah and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
um-hum	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
um-hum	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
that's right that's right	2027	A
a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um i was at TI the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through	2027	A
two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned	2027	A
and if we were there like in the middle of the summer it's unair-conditioned it was dusty and dirty	2027	A
um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no	2027	A
and a supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there and he should- he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there	2027	A
and he came up to us and he just said who's your supervisor well he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts	2027	A
he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it	2027	A
 yeah	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
uh-huh	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
um-hum	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
hum	2027	A
um	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
hum	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
yeah	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
hum	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine and they have said no	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
yeah	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
i know i didn't know that EDS has a very strict dress code i had a friend oh	2027	A
definitely i had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out	2027	A
for men it's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing- wing tipped shoes oh it is definitely lined out	2027	A
women are not allowed to wear slacks she wears coordinated suits	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
and a and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel oh it is	2027	A
spelled out when i was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff and it told about the dress code and it said	2027	A
these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way yeah	2027	A
and EDS is very particular about this hair cuts i mean it was like you can't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because	2027	A
we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse	2027	A
and she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office	2027	A
and we'd try we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're we're out here in the warehouse	2027	A
you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and you're gonna have to unload- unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid	2027	A
and she	2027	A
and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her	2027	A
	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
um-hum	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned	2027	A
and then there's another one who's who's a little younger and a little more {yuppyish} and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it	2027	A
and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that's just you	2027	A
 you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so we	2027	A
we've kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with they're they're meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then that's how they are if there just gonna be meeting with TIers	2027	A
like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
yeah	2027	A
<silence>	2027	A
 it's it's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here	2027	A
yeah this is this is kind of a fun project i've done i've done some of the other speech programs but we've never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer so this is a little different	2027	A
yeah okay bye	2027	A
	2020	B
hi um	2020	B
okay what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
	2020	B
 oh really	2020	B
 well um	2020	B
	2020	B
uh however i do- i do i do like a a lot of different forms of music so i switch quite often um i- i think i like uh	2020	B
i	2020	B
i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to but the uh there's- there's such a wide selection i think i like a lot	2020	B
or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music you know i i it-	2020	B
i i like music that is that that i feel if it's performed correctly or if it's done right or if the version is done right i like it but if it if it's not then i won't i i really don't	2020	B
rap	2020	B
yeah well i i don't really have anything against rap music i do- the one thing i do object to about rap music is is it-	2020	B
when it becomes militant or if it's uh violence oriented i i'm i- i really- i have i have strong objections to that um	2020	B
actually i listened to one time i -remember it's this is back when rap- even	2020	B
uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i	2020	B
yeah right when it was just starting i heard	2020	B
what was called talking blues which actually is rap and uh it was about the the piece of music- the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap	2020	B
and um you you listen a lot if you listen- if you listen- hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially_1 well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it you-	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah	2020	B
yeah	2020	B
	2020	B
give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that's really due to them	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah um-hum	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah it Jimi Hendrix was the original Jimi Hendrix was the original he wrote	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
okay	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
um-hum	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
	2020	B
yeah i don't know it may've it may've been somebody else because i think- i think that even Jimi Hendrix did a i think that was a cover- i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of	2020	B
like a John Lee Hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old	2020	B
i mean i i it it a lot- there're a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i've heard some songs that	2020	B
	2020	B
	2020	B
yeah- and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolutely- it was pitiful	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah there's yeah but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton i mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything	2020	B
yeah yeah i i think i think that probably- yeah i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer	2020	B
yeah	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
 oh man	2020	B
 yeah i've i i graduated back in seventy nine so but but i really i i loved i mean i was	2020	B
i was really into the album oriented music even then so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the AOR type music um the the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and	2020	B
	2020	B
	2020	B
	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah but well- well you know i mean i i've i liked a lot of the new music i think um um when i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the	2020	B
in the mid and early eighties and then	2020	B
um i don't know music is kind of in a weird it it it's in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music	2020	B
which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah Paul Simon well you know really that's not world music but what- what Paul Simon's doing i think is is is is great because he's	2020	B
uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know using- drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um	2020	B
well world music is um a lot of the a lot of	2020	B
where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener uh for example let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music	2020	B
a with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for	2020	B
let's say another audience let's say a North American and then when they hear it it it it's a really it's another form of music and you know it's sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music	2020	B
because i mean there are some i mean i like- there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldn't i wouldn't say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know it- and it's the same way with world- you know world music takes	2020	B
the forms that have really been um i guess i you know the best example or you know	2020	B
the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking	2020	B
<silence>	2020	B
yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of it's own i mean when you listen to it it's um	2020	B
uh i think that they don't use electronic- electronic- some of it it's it's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably	2020	B
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now	2020	B
and from West Africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles	2020	B
but they're they're trying to make it somewhat more modern i i a a good example- another good example was i heard Miles Davis	2020	B
and Miles Davis worked with Ravi Shankar if you can believe it i mean you know he's this jazz performer and then he's playing with Ravi Shankar who's a very good	2020	B
he's a very good arranger uh arrangement to	2020	B
but uh were going to get off i don't know but no yeah okay but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and it's just incredible	2020	B
yeah i i listened and i heard you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this the muted trumpet and i mean you never think- would think that they that they can actually play together but	2020	B
<silence>	2020	A
hi	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
well i mostly listen to popular music i uh	2020	A
listen to it all the time in in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials but uh i find myself listening to popular music and	2020	A
uh quite honestly i i have some little children and i've unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh nursery rhyme music here lately but that's not by my choice how about_1 you	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
	2020	A
	2020	A
lucky you	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
um-hum	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
um-hum	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
yeah	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
how do you feel about rap music it seems to be so popular these days	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
um-hum	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
um-hum	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
right	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
when it was really just starting yeah	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
right	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
yeah you really it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm	2020	A
and uh sounds the- sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and	2020	A
uh she thinks it's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
that's right	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
no	2020	A
yeah i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the MC Hammer who's really you know seems to be the hot one of of today he used um	2020	A
Wild Thing do you remember that that song he used i can't remember who the artist was on that	2020	A
who	2020	A
was it well	2020	A
maybe- maybe it wasn't that one then because_1 it's a living it was a living person that i'm that i'm thinking of that um that said you know hey	2020	A
that's those are my words and uh i guess that they're they because he hadn't originally gotten um permission from him to use it and he he since then has has amended that and	2020	A
paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
maybe so i	2020	A
i can't think	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
yeah	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
well right they destroyed it	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
oh yeah	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
i i remember seeing the video of it on MTV and i thought it was hideous it was oh i didn't like that either	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
i remember i saw him in a concert when i was	2020	A
i was in high school	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
um-hum he was very good- i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in um Philadelphia it was in JFK Stadium it was i don't remember	2020	A
	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
um-hum	2020	A
<silence>	2020	A
um-hum	2020	A

	2090	B
<silence>	2090	B
<silence>	2090	A
okay i guess its recording um what kind of hobbies do you have do you sing or knit or anything	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
okay i uh i started knitting awhile ago i knitted i didn't know even know what the stitch is called i just had this uh	2090	A
uh piece of yarn and i wanted to start something so i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old so i kept doing that and now i have a little blanket but that's all i've done	2090	A
so	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
um do you make sweaters and things or just blankets or	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
uh-huh	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
oh i see	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
hum	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
uh-huh	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
i probably won't make anything beyond this blanket i don't know why it's just too time consuming	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
um i like to sing i've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that	2090	A
um right now my actual job is a news reporter but uh if i could do anything i wanted to do it would be to sing professionally	2090	A
but um	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
yes uh-huh i i'm in uh i work for channel six in Waco	2090	A
and so i do little news reports and things that	2090	A
	2090	A
but um	2090	A
	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
uh no not much um my day is usually pretty full my schedule is like from nine to five thirty but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine -until	2090	A
nine at night or ten or whatever so it's hard to make plans much less you know have a hobby	2090	A
and even if i had a hobby like knitting or something and i wanted to take it to work i'd probably never get to it you know so	2090	A
what do you do	2090	A
normally	2090	A
oh okay	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
um-hum	2090	A
	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
um-hum	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
oh	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
right	2090	A
i showed- i showed mine to my boyfriend and he was like you didn't make that	2090	A
oh yeah it it looks uh halfway decent actually first thing i did but	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
yeah	2090	A
 how many children do you have	2090	A
oh okay i hear them in the background there	2090	A
 all right that's a hobby in itself	2090	A
	2090	A
a job in itself	2090	A
	2090	A
	2090	A
right now i was just sitting here watching TV i was getting ready to fall asleep	2090	A
but uh	2090	A
yeah i sang at one last summer um it was my first wedding i've done um little commercials and background singing and	2090	A
um i sang all through college and things like that but i really haven't done anything really professional perse but i did one wedding last year and uh	2090	A
 i just now got some cards together kind of uh business cards that say singer and what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something and i've been passing them out to different wedding shops i mean when someone comes in	2090	A
you know for a wedding for a wedding dress and they they might ask about it	2090	A
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape you know if any one wants to listen	2090	A
and uh she wanted me to bring it in she's going to play it on Saturday so	2090	A
 that would be great if someone came and heard it and they were like i want that voice	2090	A
but uh	2090	A
i haven't got any calls yet but i only just put them out this week so hopefully i'll get some calls in especially now since this it's spring and it's the wedding season i guess	2090	A
um-hum	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
yeah that would be great then i could be getting paid for something i love to do not that i don't like reporting but i'd love it	2090	A
	2090	A
no i've never i've never had uh formal training i've just been singing every chance i get i try you know in school and yeah choirs and	2090	A
um when i was at UT i was in a group called Ensemble One ow Nine just twelve singers and we did uh little conventions and um	2090	A
uh like dinner parties and things like that	2090	A
sing pop music	2090	A
so that's what got me really really interested in it	2090	A
so i'm trying to be sensible- sensible too at the same time	2090	A
 yeah exactly my parents would have a fit probably	2090	A
but uh i think i either have a call- or yeah i do have a call hold on one second	2090	A
	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
hello	2090	A
yes okay that's my mother on the other line i need to go	2090	A
but um i think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes are we suppose to hear a beep or anything	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
oh okay my mother said ten minutes so i don't know but uh	2090	A
okay well it was nice talking to you and and	2090	A
good luck with your hobbies	2090	A
thanks bye	2090	A
	2090	A
<silence>	2090	A
	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
well i think the biggest change in like the last fifty years has been the increased number of women who work	2091	B
now i think overall there's been a change i don't think um that's uh	2091	B
been surpassed by anything else than uh that because most women seem to be taking into careers and working now and changing the way the family situation is because they're now working and we have to have people to babysit and such	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
employed outside the home now	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
more visible things and things that use different kinds of mental skills	2091	B
maybe that's a a change because sometimes taking care of a house depending on uh	2091	B
you know how big the house is and whether you had you know a lot of children may not take as much mental skills and such as what working outside the home does	2091	B
uh i think a lot of the modern conveniences today you know have eliminated matter of fact you know i think women	2091	B
even back maybe two hundred years ago when we were first starting the country may have been looked at a little differently because it was really important to have the woman there	2091	B
and she probably you know gave half of the uh work output in like a farm	2091	B
you know her skills were as needed as the man's to you know to like establish a farm from the beginning	2091	B
and then it got to be that you know with the industrial age i think the women uh were the ones staying at home and not as involved in like a big operation as a farm and their the work was more confined to the household chores	2091	B
which didn't really uh have as much to do with the whole livelihood of the family if you were in a farm situation	2091	B
it's kind of kind of kind of gone all the way around that way in the beginning you know their work input for a farm and even like putting in the crops and harvesting and such was as important as the man's you know needed both	2091	B
and then she got to be kind of in the house when that wasn't needed as much and now she's kind of like back out of the house but not working for the family business working you know somewhere else	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
 yeah	2091	B
	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
well some are kind of forced to but i did see something in the paper today i didn't read it through thoroughly but there was uh article about a a project a study that Elizabeth Dole had started when she was still at the Department of Labor	2091	B
something called Glass Ceiling it was trying to look at	2091	B
how uh much opportunity there is for women executives to move up they're still saying that there are too many women in higher uh echelons as management you know CEO's and that kind of thing	2091	B
no- no there's not many they're saying that there's kind of like a glass ceiling that uh you just don't find too many women in those positions i think it will just kind of take time um	2091	B
you know for women to be more accepted- you know accepted into those kinds of areas and to have progressed education and {experiencewise} i mean	2091	B
starting with women working a lot in the work force in the last twenty years it takes awhile for somebody to really gain enough skills to be a CEO	2091	B
and i'm a little frustrated too because a lot of women who have their own businesses	2091	B
still don't seem to have gotten away from what we might kind of consider a more woman kind of business i call it like the three C's like they're into cookies like Mrs Fields	2091	B
 and they're into cosmetics like Mary Kay and they're into uh clothing	2091	B
you know but they haven't really branched out into some other things like you don't find too many women uh really involved with technology	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
	2091	B
	2091	B
why	2091	B
why	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
	2091	B
how about a computer designed by a woman	2091	B
	2091	B
	2091	B
oh oh okay	2091	B
but historically	2091	B
 historically you think of cars being done by Ford and such so you don't want to think about a car now designed by a woman huh	2091	B
	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
	2091	B
well there's possibility that there's some woman on those design teams	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
hey there's some men designers out there that do very well Bob Macky and such	2091	B
	2091	B
 oh oh oh	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
	2091	B
<silence>	2091	B
okay all right bye	2091	B
	2091	B
<silence>	2091	A
so what's your opinion about the uh the increasing roles of women in society today	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
uh-huh	2091	A
see uh the way the way i look at it is that	2091	A
i don't think that the that there's more women in you know working today i think that the role of women in society is changing in a way that instead of working in the house	2091	A
they're working you know for paying jobs so it seems that women are becoming more prominent in society you know it seems that they're doing more work i think the work is the same it's just that they're getting different jobs different	2091	A
you know they're they're how do you say they're uh	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
yeah they're they're uh up into more open space where more people can see what work they're doing	2091	A
you know you don't get credit for working in the house but you do get credit for being the president of a corporation	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
exactly visible	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
right	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
exactly	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
uh-huh	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
exactly just as important	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
yeah i think that's the that's also has a lot to do with uh today's society you know in in the past the uh the woman was suppose to be at home cooking for the men who were working	2091	A
nowadays it's like everything is so is is so integrated a man can be a mother nowadays you know it's like just like uh what was that movie uh Mister Mom seven years ago	2091	A
and you know it's it's true you don't you know a woman and a man are are pretty much equal nowadays in in work it's like	2091	A
you don't have to be a woman to be a babysitter you can be a guy you don't have to be a man to be uh you know the president of a corporation it's it's not it's not what you are it's what your abilities are	2091	A
that's the that's the important thing so it doesn't you know it's it's integration of it doesn't matter if your a man or a woman that makes it all you know everything makes everybody look equal for a job so it doesn't matter	2091	A
nowadays that you know there's there's really no difference is is you know the the law the law says there's no difference so more women are are taking that opportunity to be in those spots	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
too many	2091	A
oh okay okay	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
yeah	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
right	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
uh-huh	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
one thing that's kind of due to the the market you know uh uh a woman's cookie store is much preferred to a man's you know a woman's clothing store is much preferred to a a man's clothing store for women you know	2091	A
like you uh a guy wouldn't want to buy a car designed by a women	2091	A
you know it's just like that	2091	A
it's it no it's just these these things you know these these uh values that that you're brought up with	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
oh see that's different uh a computer is unisex	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
unless you design it in some sort of way which can really satisfy you and not a man around i don't know	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
exactly you know it's like	2091	A
just one of those those things uh that you're brought up with	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
well even i'm sure there is but you know you don't want you don't want a car that's designed a man doesn't want a car that's purely designed by a woman same reason that you may not want a dress or you may not want you know you you	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A
of course but they're homosexual	2091	A
	2091	A
yeah those those men are homosexual like uh what's that Pierre Cardin and and uh Halston course he died of AIDS so there that's proof	2091	A
well i have to go eat dinner now	2091	A
uh thank you very much for talking bye	2091	A
<silence>	2091	A

well um i wouldn't uh i definitely wouldn't dispute that it's- it's it's actually my wife's dog uh i i became part owner six months ago when we got married but uh	2019	B
it uh definitely responds to uh to authority and i've had dogs in the past and uh	2019	B
it seems it seems to uh respond real well it- it she's- she's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force i guess is what i'd like to say	2019	B

yeah i can honestly say we do um we uh just recently put a security system in our house and so now uh in order to uh	2019	B
to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the the master bedroom during the day and then she's got the the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day but	2019	B
we've always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door she's definitely ready to get out and run- run around	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
really	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
oh wow	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B

um-hum	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
wow that's uh	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
yeah that's interesting	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
yeah i know- i know our dog has had uh had some different reactions she's never really been around children and uh	2019	B
if if the child is is pretty straight forward um she's fine if- if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and and yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared	2019	B
uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion with- with uh with younger kids	2019	B
but uh you know that's it's a matter of exposure really um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in South Dakota	2019	B
and she was the one that was intimidated then there was about seven kids ranging from about	2019	B
three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma and the dog kind kind of felt out of place then because_1 she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions she really didn't know how to handle herself so	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
she really did she just uh she she was almost- she was just inundated with with all the attention uh she she kind of she kind of sat and and soaked it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play and and whatnot but uh	2019	B
it was it was just such- such a new experience for her she's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most so uh	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
uh pardon	2019	B
oh it's uh Mitzi	2019	B
yeah	2019	B
oh okay	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
yeah	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B

<silence>	2019	B
yeah yeah	2019	B
yeah i had uh i had a similar uh experience i i grew up on a farm so i always had uh outdoor pets	2019	B
and uh the dog i had when i moved to Dallas about five years ago was a uh Springer Spaniel black Lab cross	2019	B
and he was a real a real lovable type but uh definitely not an apartment type animal so he uh he had to stay home	2019	B
yeah yeah it really was it he uh apparently had a tough time with it for a little while then he he got he came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on but uh	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B
yeah	2019	B
<silence>	2019	B

<silence>	2019	A
oh uh-huh so you you've only known the dog what- how long did you say that-	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A

<silence>	2019	A
oh it's still just a pup	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
yeah i have a uh	2019	A
well a mutt myself i call it a uh a {chowpherd}	2019	A
it's uh part Chow and part Shepherd and it as i understand it uh both sides of the were thoroughbreds so she's a genuine {chowpherd}	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
she has the the color and the black tongue- tongue of a Chow	2019	A
but uh she has the shape the shape of a uh uh Shepherd	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds so she's a medium size	2019	A
but she's big enough to be intimidating it is a fixed- a fixed female by the way	2019	A
and right from day one she was teaching me	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
	2019	A
she is she's the most intelligent dog i've ever seen	2019	A
course i'm	2019	A
little prejudice of course	2019	A
	2019	A
no the first time i brought her home she was only uh was it six weeks old	2019	A
and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area	2019	A
but uh next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom	2019	A
so on next night i spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there	2019	A
but it wasn't too long till she uh found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning	2019	A
and since then uh i've i live alone	2019	A
and uh i live in a motor home by the way i'm uh an RV full time RVer	2019	A
and it's it's such a pleasure to come home at night and she- you can see her smiling from ear to ear she's so happy to see me	2019	A
and uh i don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
uh-huh	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
well my dog's an outdoor type she does not like to be indoors	2019	A
uh she'd rather sleep- sleep outside on the the cold ground at night	2019	A
but uh i do make her come in	2019	A
and i feed her indoors that's to lure her in but during the day i have her on a uh on a leash	2019	A
which is uh on sort of a run i have a a thirty foot cable	2019	A
running from one stake to another and then attached to that is a uh twelve foot leash so she can cover quite an area	2019	A
and uh she's the best uh	2019	A
burglar alarm going	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
oh yeah she uh it's the strangest thing though uh children	2019	A
no matter how strange they are or how new they might be can uh walk right up to her	2019	A
but adults if they're strange to her or or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off	2019	A
and i have not discovered yet where the the line is between children and adults	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
but she- uh she is a great comfort to me	2019	A
<silence>	2019	A
uh-huh	2019	A

<silence>	2095	B
yeah yeah well i remember last year or or the year before uh we had ice and snow we had a had a terrible ice storm uh around this time of the year	2095	B

<silence>	2095	B
hm	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
yes i was just talking to my son today he's up in Boston and it was twenty nine there and it was you know in the seventies out here and it was really uh he really wished he could be here rather than there	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
oh really	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
uh-huh	2095	B
uh-huh i haven't you know i don't- i don't- i think it's really been delightful i- i come uh i've spent most of my time in in warm weather areas and uh uh the ice and snow just doesn't uh hold any allure for me at all	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
uh-huh	2095	B
	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
here- do you you think think San Antonio's more comfortable than Dallas	2095	B

<silence>	2095	B
oh wow	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B

<silence>	2095	B
hm wow	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
hm i know i- i- i tend to	2095	B
i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate uh uh it doesn't doesn't- some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons but	2095	B
uh i i'd rather you know like southern California you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time	2095	B
so it's kind of a luxury	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
well i guess this the weather isn't as as lively a topic as uh as some of the others we might have gotten	2095	B
	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B
	2095	B
<silence>	2095	B

okay	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
yeah it's it it's it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year there's you know you see a little bit more rain	2095	A
i mean by uh by mid February i mean we start getting a lot of rain	2095	A
but it	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
um-hum	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
yeah unseasonable i used to my wife and i we used to live in San Antonio couple years ago and it was it was i remember the first day of spring it was so much ice that came down	2095	A
later on that afternoon- that afternoon evening it was just it was horrible	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
yeah	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
yeah	2095	A
well um i don't know i- i guess i'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather um i like- i like it warmer i mean i like it	2095	A
you know i like it warm but it doesn't really matter i mean i'd i would much rather see it cooler at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly	2095	A
but um	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
	2095	A
 i mean i got used to it it was really strange i mean when i when when when we came to San Antonio it was just like uh	2095	A
uh you know it just just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to Dallas and it was just	2095	A
it's it's not it's not that it's just hot or dry it's just it's not very comfortable it just	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
yeah a little bit	2095	A

you know it's just you know so mild and then been- been to such extremes like San Angelo Texas where you just where you walk outside and you sweat you know you're sweating	2095	A
you look down at your arm but you see the water leaving your arm it's so hot and you feel it pulling away	2095	A
bizarre	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
yeah	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A
yeah	2095	A
<silence>	2095	A

<silence>	2023	A
the ATM machines	2023	A
<silence>	2023	A

<silence>	2023	A
well no he doesn't have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh ATM machine and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records	2023	A
but uh he knows when he's overspends and when he doesn't and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card you know i've used the credit card a couple times to pay bills	2023	A
<silence>	2023	A
yeah	2023	A
<silence>	2023	A

<silence>	2023	A
and see the thing is you know he go out and he'll spend it when he wants you know and uh uh i'm afraid to i'm afraid to use that credit card	2023	A
<silence>	2023	A
yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and	2023	A
he's not a yeller though but	2023	A

yeah i'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk	2023	A
<silence>	2023	A
that's what i'm looking for now that's why i was just trying talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing	2023	A
<silence>	2023	B
okay	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh yes and i believe we all do and and it's just too easy to use	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
 oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
um it uh you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact i'd rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
uh yes	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yes that's uh real easy to do i have to watch it	2023	B
in fact yeah uh we i can understand that predicament	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
um	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
they they've um you know they've they've made them too easy to and too accessible at everything to to buy	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh yes	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh uh-huh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh that's good	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh no	2023	B
um yeah the ATM's they're but they're nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh	2023	B
those are fun	2023	B
you get started on them and can't quit	2023	B
 just exactly	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh it's it's real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping spree- frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you don't have to write a check or anything	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yeah is- there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yeah they	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh yeah that's it	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh yeah there's that's a weakness there that's just	2023	B
you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you don't care how much it costs or what it takes	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
uh-huh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yeah that's uh i always end up going into Wal-Mart and coming out with everything that uh i didn't have on the list	2023	B
we're just getting more than what we went in for	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
uh-huh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh yeah it's dangerous	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
um-hum oh yeah it's just too easy to do you go in for just one thing we're we're infamous about that	2023	B
and so	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
oh well yeah i well i'm i'm glad we have credit cards that's uh	2023	B
because in sometimes when there's an emergency it it comes in handy	2023	B
it's nice to have	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yeah	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
we've yeah we've had uh	2023	B
 a sick animal and uh	2023	B
the vet you know the dog and vet's are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldn't do without them	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
huh-uh no no i think it's become too much of an everyday life here they're part of it	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
the balance	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh yes uh-huh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
so you know he can't spend too much	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yes um-hum	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
i was i was just uh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh well let's see i guess we've talked what almost five minutes	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh i wish i had one of those	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh your up in Memphis	2023	B
oh your in Texas oh okay i was i was going to go goodness they really got uh this out far	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yeah yeah i'm down in Houston	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh okay yeah um-hum	2023	B
well oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had	2023	B
uh-huh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
my husband did one last night and he just loved it	2023	B
he's been getting he got a real good topic	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
so well uh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think we've pretty much said it all	2023	B
um but	2023	B
so uh but yeah uh i think we couldn't make it without them	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
um-hum	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
yeah yeah	2023	B
but uh we uh we try to keep a uh	2023	B
tight controls over uh over them but it it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and birthdays	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh goodness	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
uh-huh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
uh-huh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
it gets rough	2023	B
that's hard	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
get that cash advance uh-huh	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do they're worth it	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
oh well i- i think we've pretty much come to an end here	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
i think it was at least five minutes wasn't it	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2023	B
<silence>	2023	B
	2061	A
 hello hey how you doing	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
Fernando	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
wait let me turn off my stereo here	2061	A
because i've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
right what time is it over there- are you are you in Dallas	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
are you	2061	A
because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas	2061	A
yeah i'm in North Carolina	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
on the other coast	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
what yeah yeah it's uh i'm watching Saturday Night Live here	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
what- wait what- what did how how did you get to know about the TI thing	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
what- what are you working on	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
really i'm doing my Master's in in Computer Science and Computer Engineering	2061	A
at North Carolina State University	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
uh i don't because uh	2061	A
i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i i'm in Raleigh and	2061	A
yeah that area and it's really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
where are you at	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
oh okay so so i mean it's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and that's about it	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
oh okay	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley	2061	A
and they're asking like for a um GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like they're looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and it's like	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah i know that's why that's why i didn't apply i mean it was like	2061	A
for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
so are are you going to go for your doctorate	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
when do you get out	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
oh okay	2061	A
but uh but what if they pay for it	2061	A
 what if they pay for	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
i think i think they're military but i mean the guy is still in	2061	A
and um he- uh he works over in Maryland	2061	A
and so he's doing his Master's here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and he's doing it in like in a year and a summer	2061	A
and so he's getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that that's why you want to join	2061	A
but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your your you know Master's	2061	A
they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
but i mean i mean you the once you get your Master's you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
and	2061	A
and that's not what they're paying	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
but that's uh	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
it's uh it's like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points	2061	A
and uh everyone's a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money	2061	A
you know it's like no i- i mean IBM is like there's a joke about IBM which says you know it's like	2061	A
uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right	2061	A
and so IBM says well we have to- we have to have a team right	2061	A
and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it	2061	A
saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right	2061	A
so he goes have you come up with a -solution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower you know it's like everyone's a manager but you know it's like only use like one person does the work so	2061	A
yeah so	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah that well that's the way it works i mean that's that's why they're having problems i mean everyone's a manager and	2061	A
yeah i mean it's like it's like the people that actually do the work there	2061	A
are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know it's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank	2061	A
you know like all these people are just standing sitting- sitting- sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go what's that this track	2061	A
which it's going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time	2061	A
and so it's like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
and it fails and you're dead	2061	A
yeah well IBM doesn't fire anybody	2061	A
because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job	2061	A
which you- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit	2061	A
i mean that's their policy they never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally	2061	A
yeah like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that	2061	A
but they won't let you off what they'll do is like	2061	A
suppose you know like you're a manager so they'll put you into	2061	A
keeping up the paper you know it's like how much paper is going in	2061	A
and then you say that's not my job so you quit	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
right	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
right	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
right	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
no but i mean it's like it's like	2061	A
they they have like this different policy i don't know my dad works for them_1 but it's like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know it's like	2061	A
they won't say	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it	2061	A
and so that's what you're gonna go for	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
and and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge	2061	A
what	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
they- they made like uh small personal computers	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
i don't know i- i don't know but what they do is	2061	A
what they did i don't know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away	2061	A
and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away	2061	A
yeah because- so is it like for example you test a chip	2061	A
it can't last seven years but it can last five	2061	A
IBM says let's throw it away Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you	2061	A
and so that's i mean they're still around i think	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
so that's what that's what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they that's why they're so compatible	2061	A
because i mean and by the time you have a computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway	2061	A
you know	2061	A
 well i mean there's like	2061	A
when when you realize teachers- one of my teachers got this computer and which you know it's like um voice uh synthesis and stuff	2061	A
and he got that he said you know it's like um	2061	A
i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory	2061	A
	2061	A
Jesus Christ you know it's like why do you want more because it's like one second	2061	A
of recording i mean you put into a Wave	2061	A
and you want to correct the errors in the Wave	2061	A
takes so much i mean it's like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by Markov model	2061	A
and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know you're trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course it's going to take a lot	2061	A
imagine imagine what it is for us to make Markov models you know it's like Jesus Christ	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah yeah	2061	A
<silence>	2061	A
yeah	2061	A
well like they say like nobody can get enough you know it's like	2061	A
once you have something and it's like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right	2061	A
and they were showing this like Three D graphics- Three D graphics view of like	2061	A
what no no no no this is like this is like video game stuff okay but the only thing was that it was just lines okay like if you	2061	A
	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
hello	2061	B
not bad not bad What's your name	2061	B
Fernando my name is Nick	2061	B

<silence>	2061	B
oh well you're on the uh lets see	2061	B
yeah twenty one	2061	B
yeah shoot man it's what midnight almost	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
 yeah okay all right well i guess we're supposed to talk what about credit card	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and	2061	B
a a Master's in uh information systems	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah where at	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
hey how do you like it out there	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
 Raleigh Durham yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
yeah so it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they don't have a whole lot there	2061	B
uh well i'm in Monterey California right now	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
two hundred fifty	2061	B
okay it it's it's a lot bigger than Monterey is but we're just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco	2061	B
and it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
no no i go to the it's the Naval Postgraduate school out here	2061	B
	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
well that's what they look for whether or not they get it it's hard to say	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah it's pretty tough it's pretty tough i mean uh let's face it you know and you know are you did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know it's what you do	2061	B
you know so uh i don't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
probably not see i'm in the Navy	2061	B
and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably won't do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
oh probably be another twelve years	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
oh you know i like what i'm doing right now	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
excuse me	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
if they pay for a PhD	2061	B
nah they won't pay for it they've i think they have maybe two people a year go get their PhD	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah they civilians or uh military	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B

yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
	2061	B
well a lot of times it's you know a lot of times it's not the money that keeps people- that keeps people	2061	B
you know they they like what they're doing they you know they feel good about what they're doing that type of thing it's more	2061	B
	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
oh easily i'm sure	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
no well it depends on what rank you are of course	2061	B
well i mean like i say if you're if you're you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah those are few and far between though	2061	B
	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah i imagine it's really competitive	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
too many chiefs and not enough Indians	2061	B
yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
i didn't realize that	2061	B
	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B

<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
oh yeah they've got a they've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market	2061	B
and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you you- you probably won't get fired for getting IBM material where's if you try something different	2061	B
they'll they'll say yeah why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline	2061	B
	2061	B
no	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B

illegal- illegal or something like that yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
so in other words that's the way they force people out	2061	B
that's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy	2061	B
but it doesn't- they don't really say that you know you're you're always going to have great career conditions	2061	B
yeah hey that's kind of sad	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
no	2061	B
well they're the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of IBM a lot of times and the main	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
yeah well you know that's that's a that's a big thing	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah they are out of Korea right	2061	B
leading edge don't they	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah small PCs aren't they're out of Korea right	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
oh yeah	2061	B
	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
okay	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah i've seen well i've seen them around anyway you know	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
most people do or they have to anyway	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
wow	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
um-hum	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
that's amazing yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they're gonna require	2061	B
yeah both both in terms in RAM as well as uh you know standard memory or disk memory- disk base	2061	B
so	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
well yeah you find out more	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
yeah	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
uh-huh	2061	B
<silence>	2061	B
like those hologram deals	2061	B
like a hologram just graphics on a on a	2061	B
okay	2061	B
	2061	B
	2096	A
do you feel that uh drug testing is necessary at the workplace	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well uh not just the invasion of privacy but the the chance of uh false positive being- being reported	2096	A
uh i have been drug tested in the past and it's not really a pleasant experience at work	2096	A
and uh it gives you the uh impression- the uh impression that the company really doesn't trust the people that work for them_1	2096	A
and you're pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah well they make uh allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take the test	2096	A
but there's always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later	2096	A
or if the prescription say ran out or if you're using something that's uh older than older than the date uh on the package or whatever	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected	2096	A
uh we're required to go attend a uh a counseling session	2096	A
and uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record	2096	A
it's just not not a real good uh thing to have on your uh employment uh records	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
sure	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period	2096	A
and uh they they do it on a random basis i'm not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within five years if it really is random	2096	A
so i'm not sure exactly what they base that on	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah um-hum sure	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
okay	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
well i'm not sure exactly if that's true though because i know people that have been tested more than one time	2096	A
and many have not been tested yet	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
uh couple of years yeah	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
 okay it took them awhile to find me	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
oh no well they- they did all the all the top level managers	2096	A
uh at first	2096	A
and uh everybody else uh gets to take their turn	2096	A
so they called me in uh just a few months ago	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
right	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
oh no i never thought about that i- i had some questions for the for the the nurse who was uh conducting the test in the health center though	2096	A
asked her if she enjoyed her job	2096	A
	2096	A
she thought it was different you get to meet a lot of people	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
so i try i try to introduce some levity there	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
uh-huh	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah	2096	A
yeah well there are a lot of people who express uh much stronger feelings about it than i have	2096	A
and in fact i know some people that uh probably will quit before being tested even though there's nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know from the test results just a matter of principle	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
oh yeah	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah well i know some people that i suspect are casual users of uh marijuana as well and i expect that they probably uh mended their ways uh in uh	2096	A
in response to this uh drug testing that they no longer uh even use anything like that on a casual basis	2096	A
because it is a matter of of losing your job if you get caught say a second time	2096	A
and even the first time uh for these people are uh oh well on their way in on on the technical ladder or management and they're jeopardizing their positions	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah yeah	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
well some companies have gone that far uh TI has not	2096	A
but others have and they're setting themselves up for uh more lawsuits i think than uh	2096	A
than we are	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
right i don't mind so much the fact that they test people but uh not questioning the validity of the results is is a problem because uh	2096	A
uh	2096	A
i- i- i fully expect that that any test results that comeback for me would be negative that in in the event that one would be positive there's no recourse other than get yourself a lawyer or go to this counseling session and admit guilt uh they won't accept anything else	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
right	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
yeah well if if you turn down the counseling they- they will fire you	2096	A
that's uh condition of employment	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
sure	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
is that right	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
i thought that's the only one that the government does use so	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
i'm not sure	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
okay yeah there aren't just too many places uh that do testing like that where the government uh uh gives well	2096	A
gives them full reign uh trust the results because_1 they have to prove on a continual basis that uh that they are meeting um their standards for false positives and whatnot	2096	A
they claim uh zero false positives ever and i find that very hard to believe	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
okay well uh hum	2096	A
i think yeah i'm sure it is i think that about covers what we want to talk about	2096	A
<silence>	2096	A
i enjoyed it okay sure bye	2096	A
	2096	A
	2096	B
um i have mixed feelings about it um i don't particularly care for people who take drugs and uh it's a possibility of having accidents in the workplace but um i also feel like it's an invasion of privacy	2096	B
	2096	B
right right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right yeah yeah i have a lot of problems with it um i um i have been tested also several times and uh in fact it has always come up negative i mean but that's no problem with it	2096	B
coming up negative but i do take prescription drugs and i'm always been afraid that those were going to come up and show something on any of the tests	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
yeah	2096	B
	2096	B
right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right right yeah but i agree with you though they uh they're trying to uh you know they're they're saying that you are guilty until proven innocent and uh and i don't really appreciate that at all	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
no no because this can follow you um at other places too	2096	B
i was reading uh this morning in the newspaper where it was talking about um they have companies or or organizations out now who will go and do background searches on uh employees before they ever hire them	2096	B
and if you get one of those false negative reportings and and you're fired from your job that's going to carryover into other jobs um no matter um you know if it's truth or not so yeah it can stick with you for a long time	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum um-hum	2096	B
	2096	B
well uh cause you work for TI also right yeah because uh i think what they say what they would uh take your name out of the hopper	2096	B
so that whatever is left in the hopper you know it's it's um uh that's when you'd be tested and then when you were tested then it'd be taken out of there so that's that's how they said they would uh do it over a five year period	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um well it's only been what a year two years	2096	B
um-hum um-hum yeah it hadn't been i know i was called up right away it didn't no i was called up let's see yeah we started testing in January and i was called up right away in January	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
uh-huh	2096	B
uh-huh	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum yeah but yeah you're right that wasn't a very pleasant experience	2096	B
especially i felt like there was a camera watching	2096	B
	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
uh-huh	2096	B
 what'd she say	2096	B
 yeah on a continuing basis too	2096	B
 you know that was uh that was a really interesting because_1 it was a great big room the bathroom it was it was a great big room and uh and i remember the- the vents you know just right over the top of the toilet	2096	B
	2096	B
	2096	B
yeah	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
yeah	2096	B
yeah	2096	B
well um i guess growing up in the sixties and uh i don't know that particular era and generation i think about it though whether i have some friends who are occasional uh marijuana smokers and	2096	B
you know it's just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation	2096	B
and uh but yeah they're they're just adamant that they're not going to be you know tested and they're going to fight it and um you know try and um see what they can do that it's an invasion of privacy	2096	B
but i don't particularly care to uh you know to uh to get into drugs or anything else so it's not a problem for me but i uh i can kind of understand from the other point of view	2096	B
	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
yeah yeah	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
yeah	2096	B
	2096	B
oh yeah yeah i i could really see that uh so yeah they'll just have to find other means of uh relaxing and	2096	B
	2096	B
but the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and cocaine and the other those so-called uh illegal drugs you know what about alcohol	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
i think so yeah yeah but you know alcohol destroys you know so many families so now	2096	B
so that's that's what i thought was interesting that uh there are still drugs out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs	2096	B
you know	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
oh yeah yeah yeah because you'd be strongly into denial it's just like well we know you take it we've got the positive test results and you're going i don't i don't	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right	2096	B
right	2096	B
right yeah i think there's some flaws in it i i think their main objective is is good you know to make sure they have a drug free workplace but i do think that there are a lot of flaws in there	2096	B
and i understand that the government will not use that particular drug testing agency that that TI is using	2096	B
um yeah because they're not as reliable as the government wants them to be	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
oh well i heard just the opposite	2096	B
 so i don't know it could just be rumors that spread around you know when they	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
yeah	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
right	2096	B
um-hum	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
oh	2096	B
yeah that that to me yeah it'd be very hard to believe too	2096	B
<silence>	2096	B
is our five minutes up okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye	2096	B
	2096	B
	2082	A
okay what do you feel is contributing most to air pollution	2082	A
cars you think so	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
uh-huh	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah i i would have figured that some of the factories may be contributing as much as as uh automobiles	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
um-hum	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
um-hum	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
well if you only have to get your car in inspected once a year you can just go have it fixed real quick right before the inspection	2082	A
and and a lot of when you a lot of places when you go get the inspection they just pull it out of the garage and then pull it back in and they don't really check anything they just make sure the lights work basically	2082	A
have they	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
um-hum	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
oh gosh	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah that'll help	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
less people driving and more people- you know more people riding in one car rather than everybody riding to work by themselves will help a little bit and if if everyone car pooled that would cut it down in half	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
uh-huh	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
uh-huh	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah	2082	A
well uh in uh San Antonio the parking downtown i work downtown and the parking is so dadgum expensive you basically have to car pool to be able to afford to park it costs seventy five dollars a month just to park my car	2082	A
so i ride with two other uh girls	2082	A
so that way it will only costs me twenty five dollars a month to park but it's just crazy and it's from what i understand i know a girl in Washington DC and it costs her a couple of hundred dollars a month to park her car	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah and from what i understand New York City is worse that it just costs a fortune to own a car in New York City	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
hum-um	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
um-hum	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah uh once you're in downtown San Antonio it's real easy to get around they have a they have these uh buses that that look like little street cars	2082	A
and they go all around that it's just real easy to get around once you're downtown the problem is getting downtown and they have some uh Park and Ride uh Express is where you go to the the bus stop and you get on the bus and it takes you directly downtown	2082	A
but they don't have enough of them and they're not convenient enough	2082	A
and there just happens to not be one convenient to where i live so if if there were i would ride the bus	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
oh no not really um	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
i've noticed once flying into DFW there was just a a brownish orange haze over the city it was the ugliest thing i had ever seen	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
this is a nice time of the year though when it's so windy it just seems everything is so fresh	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
well	2082	A
<silence>	2082	A
yeah i guess so	2082	A
i think it's five and i think we have	2082	A
well it was nice talking to you bye-bye	2082	A
	2082	A
	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
 cars	2082	B
yeah i really do i because i'm from California originally and so i saw the beginning i feel i saw the beginning of air pollution in the fifties and i think then it was basically from from automobiles i really do	2082	B
and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and now it's just terrible factories don't help	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
but we have so much traffic now so many cars you know they're trying to fix it uh with all this emission control and everything but then i still see cars going down the road with all this smoke pouring out of the back end of them_1	2082	B
and that infuriates me i always want to tell them you know don't you know what you're doing to our air and i don't understand how they can get their uh how they can get their car inspected and get away with that	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
yeah	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
they've really cracked down up here yes uh really my neighbor has a uh he has a a fairly new car but	2082	B
it's an in the eighties it's a Taurus	2082	B
and he went to get his inspected and there was something about the emissions something that wasn't quite right and they wouldn't pass it and mean there's no smoke or anything comes out of his car it's a nice car	2082	B
and uh he had to have a lot of work done on it before it would meet you know the emissions and he went to several places	2082	B
so so they're starting to crack down	2082	B
yeah i i really	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
yes um TI is trying to promote car pooling up here with buses and and trying to get people to ride share and stuff like that	2082	B
but um i use my car for work- during the day for the job so it's really hard for me to do that	2082	B
 but	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
 oh my gosh	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
oh that's terrible that that make me take the bus	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
you don't really need one in the city and they have such good um	2082	B
uh what transit systems you know they've got trains and everything i we- and we really need that	2082	B
uh Texas is really lacking in transit and i think when they if they would do that and put in trains and stuff that that would really help a lot because people i would much rather take a bus or a train than use my car	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
um-hum	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
um-hum	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
yeah	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
can you really see pollution down there now	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
not but see you can see it here i mean you can just see it hanging in the air	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
yeah that's it	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
it's terrible it is really terrible	2082	B
and in the summer time it seems to be worse because it there's no air to blow it out you know it's it's horrible	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
and all the trees are starting to bloom out and everything yeah	2082	B
so i just hope it's not too late i hope we've caught all this pollution and stuff hope they're we're just not going to wait until it's too late to do anything we're going to have to live in bubbles	2082	B
worries me it worries me they should have been doing things that their doing now twenty years ago	2082	B
you know to stop it	2082	B
and they really haven't	2082	B
<silence>	2082	B
so well what do we do should we hang up	2082	B
	2082	B
okay have we reached ten minutes	2082	B
okay- okay okay okay bye-bye	2082	B
	2082	B
<silence>	2087	A
that's right uh i think so i had a sister who is in the Peace Corps as a matter of fact	2087	A
uh back when it was uh a Kennedy thing uh sixty	2087	A
uh seven and eight	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
uh-huh	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
well i feel like if it were	2087	A
 if if everyone had an equivalent requirement such that it were inescapable and i think that	2087	A
that that would be important for me that that there wasn't that it was optional that if if every person and i could pick a time i guess rather than worrying about whether it was one years or two years suppose it were to be uh eighteen months	2087	A
uh if every citizen were required to participate in public service and could choose from a sort of a menu of what jobs would might be available at any given time	2087	A
and could not get out of that no matter what short of dysfunctional handicap	2087	A
you know that the person were just unable to participate i guess i would not be against that as a requirement i i'm not sure the country needs it but i don't know that i would be against it and it	2087	A
it seems to be it would be important that nobody could could- could- to opt out	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
it seems that you could have a menu where depending on the needs for jobs you could reward them differently and then let people compete for them if you you know i could envision somebody saying by the time you were	2087	A
twenty five or pick some clock age that that would say you would have to give a certain number of years and you could you could say well i i could go in the army i could go in the navy i could go into civil service i could be a forest ranger a hospital attendant or whatever and	2087	A
and i guess some jobs that might be higher risk you might want to compensate	2087	A
with some reward that was higher which would	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
oh yeah that's interesting	2087	A
uh like you can go go in the army for eighteen months or you can be a forest ranger for two years or something	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
uh-huh	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
how do you feel about whether it's necessary or not it if	2087	A
uh it it seems like we tend to be seem to be focused in on as long as it were equal and equitable it would be okay but uh how do you feel about whether it's something that the country needs or what the benefits would be	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
um-hum	2087	A
so you're saying-	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
uh-huh	2087	A
yeah it seems to me like there's a lot of infrastructure problems that we're accumulating in the United States that	2087	A
uh we could address with with manpower everything from like well like national parks began to be in a state of decline because we can't fund their repair and some of them were built in a period during the depression when	2087	A
there were deliberate programs put in place to get people occupied and so we put millions and millions of person hours into developing some of the parks systems and we can't afford to keep up	2087	A
and we probably in order to return them to a state of a usefulness we'd have to invest those same person hours but we couldn't pay regular wages and	2087	A
uh i guess it wouldn't bother me if the wages were barely scale or subscale if it were a sacrifice that everyone made	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
uh-huh	2087	A
so i	2087	A
so i wouldn't i guess i wouldn't feel like there would be a required compensation as any sort of uh the army approach room board and forty bucks a month to uh spend at the P X	2087	A
	2087	A
	2087	A
yeah well that would be back in the and he didn't have much more than that uh back in the sixties or so i mean it's a little more money than that but it wasn't very much it was you you didn't do much other than buy a car or maybe have enough money to send home to a wife	2087	A
uh	2087	A
	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
okay	2087	A
i think it's good that people feel that they commit themselves to a country or to that they've if you offer of yourself you feel differently afterwards i think about the fact that you've put yourself into a country as opposed to expect everything to be given to you	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
interesting	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
it appears that we've come to an agreement	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
okay thanks for calling	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
okay and from Raleigh bye	2087	A
<silence>	2087	A
	2087	A
so uh	2087	B
	2087	B
public service uh	2087	B
i guess Peace Corps the one you think of the most	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
oh really	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
yeah i've never had any uh	2087	B
experience with anyone that i've known personally in the Peace Corps my brother was uh	2087	B
did a little uh guess you would call it kind of like missionary work to Liberia one time	2087	B
when he was younger	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
i think uh	2087	B
i think i kind of agree i think that uh	2087	B
you know public service is uh has basically if you tie it in with uh you know a military option if you have a if have that requirement i think that uh	2087	B
this ought to be an option at least you know to be uh some sort of a either domestic public service or a foreign type you know Peace Corps type of thing	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
yeah or maybe uh	2087	B
yeah you maybe might adjust the time uh you know	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
yeah something like that i think they do that we have a German exchange student living with us and they uh he said they do that something like that in Germany	2087	B
have uh	2087	B
some kind of service that they have to go into	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
i think uh i think there's a number of reasons that it would be good to have it as a uh requirement	2087	B
uh one being for the uh benefit of the youth or the individual them self	2087	B
i think that uh there's a lot to be gained and a certain amount of discipline and uh	2087	B
you know self uh	2087	B
self control and so forth and gain by uh certain public service plus you know feeling of satisfaction and what have you	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
so i think uh you know also there's probably there's uh a lot to be said for uh you know the good that would be uh become of the public service works it might be uh and that aspect be helpful	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
yeah i uh i think i agree uh like	2087	B
i guess i had that in the back of my mind like the WPA and some of those uh	2087	B
type of projects	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
oh you're dating yourself there	2087	B
	2087	B
that uh that was about the pay when i think i was in	2087	B
	2087	B
	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
but uh	2087	B
	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
yeah exactly	2087	B
but uh	2087	B
you know i think the experience itself is positive	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
 yeah i agree with that	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
	2087	B
have we	2087	B
we can't argue the point very much	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
yeah uh so long from Houston	2087	B
<silence>	2087	B
bye bye	2087	B
	2087	B
	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
good and yourself	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah me too	2013	B
pardon me	2013	B
i'm in Lewisville	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
little bit	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
that's a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don't want to have to take away but on the other hand you don't want uh the poorer school districts to go under either and uh here in Lewisville they had a thing on the ballot that they wanted to	2013	B
uh rollback the taxes on everybody's houses and everybody would save	2013	B
uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and i happened to know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would just take away all all their money	2013	B
and as far as i'm concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools that's what we need because_1 we got	2013	B
you know Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because_1 we got little kids and we're uh not too pleased about that	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
pardon me	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
that's true	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
i think we're gonna see-	2013	B
are you	2013	B
okay	2013	B
i think were gonna see a day come	2013	B
yeah	2013	B
i think i think we're gonna see a day when schools- uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition just like colleges are uh and it'll only be to those who are having kids going to school that's probably the most fair way but	2013	B
you know uh that way old people don't have to have have money going to the schools because_1 they don't have little kids going to schools	2013	B
but uh i wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening and uh we'll see what happens	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah	2013	B
yes	2013	B
um	2013	B
i don't know that i think has	2013	B
pluses and minuses because_1 uh those that	2013	B
are economically disadvantaged won't have the ability to make a choice the choice will be thrust upon them and so where's the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and that's	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yes	2013	B
yes	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
i think the only way they're gonna really get to the problem and solve it is to have equal funding for every school in the state whether you it's in a poor tax district or a high tax district and uh	2013	B
that's the only way that i can see it's gonna be resolved is there are gonna be people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and and it's gonna be a real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah	2013	B
and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise that- that's the problem is the teachers don't get enough money and anybody who could be a good teacher doesn't want to become a teacher usually because they don't pay enough	2013	B
i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but i really couldn't go into teaching because_1 it was not economically feasible for me to do so	2013	B
i'm a mathematician	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
pardon me	2013	B
 oh i don't know there are better fields to pick	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
i mean	2013	B
yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education quite a bit but where i was before i wasn't using it hardly at all	2013	B
so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it you know i but wouldn't mind getting back into it someday but who knows what'll happen in the future	2013	B
the way people are being laid off right and left it's all a matter of uh what happens next	2013	B
but uh back- back to the taxes though i mean uh it's a difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because_1 uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax	2013	B
and	2013	B
most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it but	2013	B
way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month that's so that's a problem	2013	B
um	2013	B
which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than have a state- state lottery because_1 when you bring	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
no it didn't	2013	B
which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though good old tax and spend Annie my favorite	2013	B
uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren't gonna have a state income tax and now she's gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway uh we'll see what happens i don't know	2013	B
at any rate uh	2013	B
that	2013	B
actually no um	2013	B
i'm surprised that my- uh my income taxes are as low as they are uh we just finished our income taxes and we're getting a nice little refund back this year which is which is nicer than having to pay out	2013	B
uh which is a matter of uh	2013	B
um i'm surprised it's	2013	B
well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars	2013	B
for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to over twenty two thousand dollars that we it it's our share to pay in but i'm not paying that much income tax	2013	B
and you're gonna think well wait now where's the other eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in where- how how is that coming from me i guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot but	2013	B
it's interesting i don't know i can't imagine i guess that's why we're going in debt so deeply	2013	B
they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to to the national debt	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
that's about it i guess	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah	2013	B
yeah	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in Dallas i guess it's like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville it's a lot closer to seven	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
hum-um	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
how's that	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
oh yes	2013	B
that's the way to do it	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
no	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah	2013	B
and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax	2013	B
uh	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah i think what we need- what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending	2013	B
because_1 when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage that's in there right now i mean i once heard that uh	2013	B
uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh	2013	B
uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year	2013	B
and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five or six on the welfare so where's the other ninety percent going well it's going to the some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers	2013	B
lots of people yeah yeah	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah well i don't have that a lot of times if i've got a dollar in my wallet it's like boy where do i go- where did where'd i find that	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
wow	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah right	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
quite a quite a world we live in	2013	B
oh well	2013	B
<silence>	2013	B
yeah that's all i have to say thank you	2013	B
um-hum bye	2013	B
	2013	B
<silence>	2013	A
Arch how are you doing tonight	2013	A
oh that yeah fine kind of tired	2013	A
where am i calling	2013	A
where are you	2013	A
Lewisville okay i'm in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to uh come up with the taxes to increase the funding for schools	2013	A
what do you think about it equalization of funding	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
uh-huh	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
um-hum	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
but we're not funding them_1 like other states either though you know it we're not funding our schools like other states either	2013	A
that's right but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna solve the problem	2013	A
	2013	A
hum-um i can	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
well they're already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that's an idea	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
that's true	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
but like in Garland you can choose the school that you're going to can you tell this is past bedtime um	2013	A
like in Garland they get to choose the schools that they're gonna go to but they got to have the transportation to them_1 if it's out of their district you know out of their area i mean	2013	A
so and i like that because_1 you can find out the good schools in your area	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
yeah what do you do	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field	2013	A
well	2013	A
 yeah but that's not a bad one	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
yeah	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
what do you think about a state income tax	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not	2013	A
oh	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
so what about your income tax	2013	A
think they're hitting you too hard	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
no	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
	2013	A
huh-uh	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
which just keeps accumulating i don't know what else do you think about them_1 let's see the state	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do it figures in what is it seven point	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
because_1 i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out	2013	A
so it wouldn't be so bad all right so you think	2013	A
federal tax is okay	2013	A
state tax you can see the logic of it but	2013	A
you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too	2013	A
we don't need anymore	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that's the only thing that's saving us	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
part-	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
lots and lots of people before they get it	2013	A
but still i work in southeast Dallas	2013	A
and a lot of my children are from poor	2013	A
you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them_1 are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be	2013	A
and i mean they've always got dessert money or they've always got you know dollars on them_1 and everything and i'm thinking you know this isn't right because_1 my children don't have that	2013	A
<silence>	2013	A
yeah and you give them_1 you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat	2013	A
you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right	2013	A
 and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs	2013	A
that he	2013	A
yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don't think i do	2013	A
okay well talk- talk to you later then bye	2013	A
	2013	A
<silence>	2032	B
okay	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
oh i guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because_1 that's	2032	B
	2032	B
no no no not that kind of music no more like uh rock um you know like Led Zeppelin type	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B

<silence>	2032	B
 yeah AC DC yes	2032	B
	2032	B
well okay i guess i didn't really consider that heavy metal i mean i i think when you say heavy metal i'm i'm thinking about like Cinderella you know	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
well see i don't really care for Cinderella but i like AC DC's okay	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
yeah no i don't really care for that too much i guess	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh-huh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh-huh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B

<silence>	2032	B
oh um uh	2032	B
right right yep yeah	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
	2032	B
yeah that that was a real good one	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
well that's true they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
of the Stones yeah i agree that's the new the older stuff	2032	B
is the best of it the the new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which i don't really care for today's rock and roll too much it's	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
right yes definitely i agree	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh-huh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
right	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
yeah that	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
no not yet i guess i've been considering- kind of considering it have you seen it yet	2032	B
was it really good was it	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh-huh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
right	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh-huh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh-huh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
oh okay so you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
right well that's	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
 well no now seventies music i mean i'm like i said you know i don't like disco i've never liked disco you know but	2032	B
 well that's true that's true	2032	B
but i i was more um in the late seventies- well i- i should- like mid to late seventies like between seventy five and and seventy nine was more my era um	2032	B
well no i'm going right now but um no i didn't go then but see i graduated high school in seventy eight	2032	B
so you know in seventy eight you know rock was really starting to get really heavy you know and real um	2032	B
i don't know disco was pretty much dead by then so so that's what i mean disco wasn't really my time	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
about music oh okay	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B
uh-huh	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B

<silence>	2032	B
	2032	B
<silence>	2032	B

okay so we've got to talk about music and um do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A

okay so so then we got we got some of the same things because	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
no it's very hard because see well i mean in the whole spectrum i'd rather listen you know to- whatever- i listen to heavy metal or or classic rock	2032	A
we're talking about what they they- they call hard rock	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
like for example let's see uh Bad Company what like	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
well	2032	A

<silence>	2032	A
okay	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
well Cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
but see for example they have see what what other bands consider it like really hard rock it's like brash metal	2032	A
which all they do is they have like this guitar and they just bang at the guitar and the guitar is set like really low	2032	A
	2032	A
and what happens is ah everybody gets like totally into the music and then they start dancing around and they just bump into each other	2032	A
like like they hit each other with their shoulders	2032	A
and then you knock people down and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
no i don't like that music	2032	A
but that's that's what they do that's that's what some people call like really heavy metal and see the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also	2032	A
like really like heavy metal considered like the words heavy metal and like they always talk about like suicide and killing people and stuff like that	2032	A
	2032	A
and just hard rock has they- they don't talk about that they just talk about like life in general like Queen's Reich if you ever heard of them_1	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
so	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
okay then well no i said Queen's Reich but	2032	A
but but oh no you got to like Queen also so because	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah especially uh oh God what is it A Night at the Opera don't they have a no let's see the one that they have the the whole opera sing in the background	2032	A
oh	2032	A
Bohemian- Bohemian- Bohemian Rhapsody yeah that that was great i heard that the other day on the radio and i pumped it up	2032	A
because i mean i just love that song	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah but they had that- that that whole record was pretty good	2032	A
but then they started going downhill like everybody else	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah they they're still around they got a new a new CD out but i don't- i wouldn't buy it	2032	A
because see what happens is the oldies see what i like i like the old Rolling Stones i don't like the new stuff	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah	2032	A
yeah well for example i used to like the old Phil Collins an old Genesis and and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this	2032	A
and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like No Jacket Required	2032	A
that was good but it was on it's way of going downhill because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone and then he came out with the Invisible Touch with uh Genesis	2032	A
and that really like now i hate Phil Collins i can't stand him because i look at him and i say	2032	A
you know you were singing at this time and with these people and you were great and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you what you sing or what you record it's still going to be a number one hit	2032	A
and so that's that's what gets me mad	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
but did did you go see that new Doors movie	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah i saw it when it opened	2032	A
yeah well it- it's it's uh you know it's like i was watching Siskel and Ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies	2032	A
and they both loved the movie right they said the music's great it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that and then one of them_1 said well everything is great but i'm gonna give it a thumbs down	2032	A
and they go but why because it's like the end is like really depressing	2032	A
and so and- but but it's like but it's like the movie is so well made and the music that goes with it just picks you up see i was never i was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine	2032	A
so i mean so for me no but you learn to i mean it's just that like the the sixties music's got a lot to say	2032	A
i i never found out the a lot of the seventies music had too you know i was like	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
hey but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants and	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
did did you go to college	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
oh that's cool	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
okay	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah yeah	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in	2032	A
in progression ever in history	2032	A
so naw about everything	2032	A
so it's like nothing happened during the seventies everything happened during the sixties the seventies i don't know what they're called you know it's like	2032	A
like the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or or you know like the technology years	2032	A
because of all the computers and stuff but the seventies got nothing i mean nobody cared to name it so	2032	A
yeah i know can you imagine the uh like a big picture of John Travolta and Saturday Night what is it Saturday Night Fever him just standing there you know	2032	A
but uh yeah that's a good example to look for in history well from now on we're gonna go from the from nineteen sixty nine when they took the first step	2032	A
on the moon to nineteen eighties okay what happened in the middle don't worry don't worry you don't you're not missing anything so	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
yeah really and that's that's why i guess everybody is yeah it's like	2032	A
they don't wanna talk about that so they just don't name it i mean it was it was i guess it was pretty bad times	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A
so	2032	A
<silence>	2032	A

yep exactly i like things that uh you know two people can do but i like the quiet of doing things away you know kind of gives you some space for yourself	2072	A
and that's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create and i like to crochet and knit i made some afghans and that kind of stuff i like doing things with my hands	2072	A

<silence>	2072	A
	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
yeah	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
uh-huh	2072	A
yeah it is	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
do you do barbecues	2072	A
for uh uh uh smoking and all that stuff	2072	A
yeah yep	2072	A
i- i lived in Abilene for a little while	2072	A
and uh worked in the Abilene plant and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue and oh that was great	2072	A
really great they have some nice stuff down there	2072	A
i miss it	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
oh yeah	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
oh we did horseback- i- i did horseback riding too in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses	2072	A
and uh that was kind of for them but they weren't as interested in it as we were you know	2072	A
so uh that was a real i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know we always had horses around and i really enjoyed that	2072	A
and i was disappointed when i went to Texas i didn't see that many of them yes	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
i know i know it's true	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
uh-huh	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
yeah you too you too	2072	A
<silence>	2072	A
okay	2072	A
me too	2072	A
okay bye now	2072	A
	2072	A
	2064	B
well i am new to Texas so i don't even know what the law is in the state do you	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper	2064	B
um you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes or just	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
um-hum hum	2064	B
well	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
yes i know the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if if people who have been there	2064	B
	2064	B
are going to be killed um there's people that come to the prisons and	2064	B
and um-hum they're very violent and they want i mean they're anxious for someone to be killed and i just i can't see that	2064	B
	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
uh-huh	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
no	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
well there is so many chances for appeal that it keep-	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
yeah it's really sad i don't know i just think um	2064	B
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting	2064	B
the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know	2064	B
 is really kind of bad and	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
hum	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
that's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and repeat and never- never have any chance for	2064	B
 oh i don't know is it do you feel at all like it's a religious issue	2064	B
	2064	B
um-hum	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
hum	2064	B
i don't know sometimes i feel i mean i do go to church and things i don't know how i would feel about it but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
do you think most states have that or	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
um-hum hum	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
that still does it that's right	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
um-hum	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
have that well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
um-hum	2064	B
 so seems like a lot of people live there and then	2064	B
through appeals because i know they do frequently i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper	2064	B
if it finally gets to that point	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
yeah	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
um-hum	2064	B
so is it uh are we doing lethal injection now	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
um-hum which- which seems so awful	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
so it's a little bit more humane i guess it is	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
	2064	B
yes the other one just seems so terrible	2064	B
hum	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison	2064	B
um-hum	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
hum	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
yes	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
hum	2064	B
well um i notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area it's	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
and it's kind of been scary to think about it and	2064	B
you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
you hate to have the dubious honor of being	2064	B
you know so high in the	2064	B
in statistics	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasn't had	2064	B
any crime	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
and so we don't	2064	B
it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way	2064	B
and how they would expect how they would	2064	B
hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they can't just stop it	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
so maybe you would	2064	B
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
no i know when um we just we moved here um i from the	2064	B
i got a summons jury summons just	2064	B
like constantly it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didn't have to go and it's not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that	2064	B
i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything	2064	B
that would be really awful	2064	B
<silence>	2064	B
well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh talking about this although it has been difficult but uh	2064	B
i'd hate to decide it but i guess um	2064	B
guess it's important that we decide as a people what what we're going to do	2064	B
anyway well you have a good day	2064	B
thank you bye-bye	2064	B
	2064	B
	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
um-hum	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
well yes of course we do have capital punishment and we've you know done away with our quote fair share number	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know get into the system	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
um-hum yes that-	2064	A
that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i don't know or a person personally	2064	A
i think i would be you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that	2064	A
i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really i don't know that it is i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yeah	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes um-hum	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yeah it is it's it's a tough tough question it really is	2064	A
i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
oh absolutely	2064	A
that's-	2064	A
that's right	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
 not with me personally it is with a lot of people	2064	A
it's not not to me personally no	2064	A
no	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
um-hum	2064	A
yes	2064	A
that's a it's a tough tough question it really is	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes they're only i was reading something about it the other- day i i wanna think there's only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still	2064	A
a lot of them_1 had to have elected- elected not to do so now i don't know what they do in place of it you know maybe it's	2064	A
life imprisonment or you know something i don't i don't know how they handle it but-	2064	A
i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
oh yeah	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes a lot of them_1 do get their sentences commuted to something else	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
uh-huh yes	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
 right the first appeal is automatic so	2064	A
that delays it for a few years just right off the bat	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh	2064	A
things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes uh-huh that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of Texas before that it was uh death by electrocution	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes it certainly does	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes absolutely	2064	A
it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say	2064	A
you know yes or no i would say you know yes i- i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
no i don't think it's a monetary thing i think we hope that it will be you know	2064	A
some sort of deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that	2064	A
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
this may seem- seem to be the best way out i don't know	2064	A
easiest way out maybe	2064	A
no i don't think it's a monetary thing	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes absolutely	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes it's nothing to be proud of certainly not	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes	2064	A
so have we been very very fortunate	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
that's right absolutely	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
um-hum	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
absolutely	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
uh-huh that's right	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yeah	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
so would i- i fortunately never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
um-hum	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
uh-huh	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
right	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
uh-huh	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
sure it's it's a big responsibility it really is	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes	2064	A
so would i	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
yes absolutely	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
it is it's a tough subject it really is	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
right	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
that's right	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
well thank you it's nice talking to you uh-huh bye bye	2064	A
<silence>	2064	A
	2064	A
	2071	B
well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh	2071	B
i really don't know the answer um	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type	2071	B
sporty one but um	2071	B
 something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things	2071	B
	2071	B
yeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
amenities	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
um well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration	2071	B
but	2071	B
yeah	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
	2071	B
well that's that's a big one in my book but uh um	2071	B
i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others	2071	B
um and i would sort of like to buy American	2071	B
but you know i'm not so totally hung up on that that i wouldn't buy something else how about you	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
oh really	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
um-hum	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
oh	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah i wouldn't have thought so either	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
oh	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah i- i guess there's a lot to to think about when you're trying to make that decision	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
right	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
no but then um	2071	B
no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune	2071	B
	2071	B
yeah i've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes and	2071	B
even though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive but for them it's it's sort of a hobby too to own them_1	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
 well i haven't really- really gotten that far with it um i've always sort of liked General Motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
oh i guess i really don't know	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah that i think that's	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
um-hum my uh daughter has owned two different ones and uh	2071	B
you know we've had some work done on them_1 but it's not too bad and the reason one of the reasons we um	2071	B
bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it	2071	B
and you knew it had had been through a whole lot	2071	B
and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
i thought they would	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah	2071	B
well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
yeah	2071	B
yeah that's one of the big throwing cards for	2071	B
some of the foreign ones	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
well	2071	B
<silence>	2071	B
we talked long enough	2071	B
 okay well enjoyed it bye-bye	2071	B
	2071	B
<silence>	2071	A
okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
yeah	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
oh you do want a lot of that stuff	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
what kind of uh	2071	A
things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the	2071	A
well what do you call them you said amenities	2071	A
that they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
it is for me other people don't seem to have the same problem	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
yeah	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
yeah	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
well um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um	2071	A
several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be	2071	A
because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new	2071	A
you know we bought the car new and after um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch	2071	A
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when	2071	A
brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable	2071	A
yeah so that was that was kind of a shock	2071	A
	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh	2071	A
um a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable	2071	A
you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes	2071	A
especially not after two years	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
really oh i don't know	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
um-hum	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
yeah	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
um-hum	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
how come i've been kind of um	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
i guess the commercials are getting to me the Toyota commercials and i know that a lot of people i've i've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
i think they have a really good um quality	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
um-hum	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
um-hum	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
yeah	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
they seem to be really durable	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
so i don't know i'm i'm not ready to buy a new car yet but i don't know if if the next time i'm going to try to	2071	A
to stay with buying something American or if i'm going to go for a little more	2071	A
what i would consider to be a long-term investment	2071	A
	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
oh it's easy to get gas mileage in this car it gets excellent gas mileage	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
um-hum	2071	A
<silence>	2071	A
i think so	2071	A
	2071	A
all righty thanks bye-bye	2071	A
	2071	A
<silence>	2012	B
i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the	2012	B
typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate reaction is that- -it's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited	2012	B
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a situation- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
exactly uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of	2012	B
uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
commercial solicitations- solicitations primarily	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
yeah	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out	2012	B
and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me	2012	B
um i guess i'm not	2012	B
typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second	2012	B
this- one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that i think that's a good idea on your part i don't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
to surmise- to surmise it is there	2012	B
	2012	B
well i guess although	2012	B
i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded	2012	B
um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded but i don't feel invaded by it	2012	B
i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm not sure why uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i don't have a sense of loss from that	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
 uh the the other side of that might be uh if if someone- there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
because- right because you don't have anyway to turn it off there- did you hear about this Lotus database that was being put together	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there'd be could- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy	2012	B
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private but then if it turns out to generate	2012	B
incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of eight to- or so a week went up even higher because uh someone had had	2012	B
right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you right exactly	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
right right	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
right	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
um-hum	2012	B
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of of it so so- maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
um-hum	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
oh that's interesting	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
but but no concept for wanting to be private	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
okay	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
oh that- that would be	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
that'd be culturally shocking	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
uh-huh	2012	B
uh-huh	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
yes	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to to think about someone who doesn't know how to say private	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
yes	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
yes	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
that's interesting are there- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either growing- on a growing frequency	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
okay	2012	B
<silence>	2012	B
so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsolicited-	2012	B
	2012	A
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um	2012	A
if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's	2012	A
one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another and the first kind of	2012	A
invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this country but in the second type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh	2012	A
finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh	2012	A
um obviously everyday	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
uh-huh	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
from from personal parties or from these uh phone answering- phone uh commercial things	2012	A
oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that that uh one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever um	2012	A
because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are	2012	A
i think they prey on people's um	2012	A
inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
yeah	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean you know the classic	2012	A
oh i don't know CIA conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying to do it without your knowledge so there's	2012	A
things that invade that second type of privacy	2012	A
where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and	2012	A
	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum yeah	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
yes yes you'd be- more harmed or something yeah	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
 they had you pegged	2012	A
	2012	A
yeah	2012	A
	2012	A
yeah	2012	A
yeah and i one of the problems with the Lotus database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but	2012	A
uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you can't believe that it would it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering	2012	A
you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having	2012	A
virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and	2012	A
and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
yeah	2012	A
yes exactly	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum i also hm thought about it because_1 i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing	2012	A
that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't	2012	A
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's gonna invade my privacy very quickly and	2012	A
i realize that that i mean	2012	A
i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in India and	2012	A
things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
yeah it's it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially	2012	A
um so there's not i mean doors don't have latches on them people don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed you open it because_1 it's in your way you people walk in and out and	2012	A
as a as a westerner in India i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded	2012	A
you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic	2012	A
and people would leave me alone	2012	A
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of social- of um public behavior um	2012	A
people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it	2012	A
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms	2012	A
and which isn't alway- always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that- i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
um-hum um-hum	2012	A
	2012	A
um	2012	A
there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy	2012	A
because_1 anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that	2012	A
there's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect- will respect and if that's gone um i i really- really don't know how to live very well and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that	2012	A
<silence>	2012	A
well the classic- the other classic examples the Jehovah's Witness or or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door um	2012	A
which is more intrusive because i have to feel- really tell someone to go away and there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see	2012	A
what i look like what i live like and normally- and they're doing something that normally i really only invite people to because i	2012	A
any friend- anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my house so that is more of a sense of invasion	2012	A
	2012	A
	2073	A
okay i don't know which end do we push but okay	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
right	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
that's true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the party uh the party type followers the guys that uh	2073	A
you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they're Republican they vote- Republican- vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent	2073	A
you know are the ones that don't uh don't really	2073	A
uh show up every year because_1 they can't seem to	2073	A
to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate	2073	A
yeah	2073	A
yeah i always thought it was back when Anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but that didn't work	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
um-hum	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah yeah that's uh	2073	A
and and then people always get upset about it too because_1 you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that uh if more people vote they'll get more votes	2073	A
i'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah well that uh that's something- i i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because_1 we live in a predominately- predominately- predominately Catholic type area	2073	A
and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspirational- inspired you know and uh	2073	A
still on the other hand we're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in DC where where things are a little bit different uh	2073	A
you know it's it's women's rights and the and- and that sort of movement and so it's uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
but uh	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because_1 it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the	2073	A
the Midwest and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to uh	2073	A
the pressure that lobbyists can put	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
well	2073	A
	2073	A
right	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah well i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected	2073	A
uh	2073	A
uh-huh	2073	A
unfortunately that'll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even more- uh turnout even more because_1 more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
they'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election we'll see you in four years	2073	A
uh but yeah i hope some of the local well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with it- with	2073	A
old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh	2073	A
you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come out- turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and -have seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever	2073	A
but i know my grandmother hasn't voted in years	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
um-hum	2073	A
yeah wonder if they're going to take into account with this computerized uh this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking	2073	A
no i can't hear them_1	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
oh yeah	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
uh Washington DC um-hum	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
oh okay well i figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
no huh-uh	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
uh basically they they went through engineering companies and uh we're communications i work- i work in a communications company	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
	2073	A
yeah we sort of different	2073	A
they called me at uh ten o'clock one night that was very strange	2073	A
i guess they were doing it Eastern Standard Time i was like well i don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
yeah	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
um-hum	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
okay	2073	A
yeah okay well if you're ever in uh DC can look up Wayne Sherman you'll say oh yeah talked to that guy okay	2073	A
oh	2073	A
<silence>	2073	A
okay	2073	A
	2073	A
yeah right next to Dulles all right well i'll talk to you later bye-bye	2073	A
	2073	A
	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
okay well um let's see i i think uh there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and	2073	B
you know there's such a	2073	B
small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States and	2073	B
that you know their votes- votes not going to make that much difference	2073	B
and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in and that person	2073	B
is going to have a lot of uh since there's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them_1 so	2073	B
it'd be really difficult to have that one person- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
hum	2073	B
yeah	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
right yeah that's good	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah	2073	B
yeah there's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um	2073	B
the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded	2073	B
as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
but	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
um-hum	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
 yeah	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah that's that's true i think in uh the Texas governor election i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
oh really	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
right	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
um-hum	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah that's true	2073	B
and uh	2073	B
yeah that's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
um-hum	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
right	2073	B
yeah and it's uh	2073	B
real true that uh	2073	B
you- you know they'll say one thing	2073	B
to get elected and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand	2073	B
you know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know that's uh	2073	B
with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to	2073	B
even try to do	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
 right	2073	B
right after the war	2073	B
that really uh	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
uh that's true	2073	B
yeah	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
 right yeah	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
um-hum	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
right that's right you know neither has mine as a matter of fact and uh that's true they i think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that's not necessarily true	2073	B
because you know that's what the media says well the majority believes this way so	2073	B
uh they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
so that's that's true	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
 yeah do you hear the dogs in the background here okay they're	2073	B
the children next door just opened the fence and they went off yeah but anyway that's i guess we've uh talked long enough and that was sort of interesting what part of the country are you from	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
are you really wow this is i'm in from this is Dallas where i'm at the outskirts of Dallas	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah do do you work for TI in any way	2073	B
wow how did you how did they get you or	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
oh	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
oh okay right i work for TI so	2073	B
we saw it on the uh the TV- News one day and i thought wow that might be interesting	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah	2073	B
well	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah Central Standard Time's what they're doing it by	2073	B
yeah	2073	B
i still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet but	2073	B
i didn't study it that hard so maybe i'll figure it out	2073	B
but anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you and that was an interesting topic	2073	B
	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
 okay i'm i'm Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area well we live right by the airport	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
oh okay	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
yeah	2073	B
<silence>	2073	B
okay bye	2073	B
	2073	B
	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
yep	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
i wasn't in Central America but uh talking about Latin America i kind of i consider Latin America to include Central and South America and i did live in uh Sao Paulo Brazil for four years	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
uh realistically- realistically i	2038	A
yes i don't see the the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not not really big enough to uh accommodate the	2038	A
the shipping that it once did and uh maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however i think we're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh Noriega in this	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
uh-huh	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
no i haven't	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
i i have a a little bit i can't say that i'm i i would be an expert on the on the region but uh certainly uh i	2038	A
it it gets it gets- there you you've got this this toss up between- or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have it's it's um	2038	A
own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people and then on the other hand uh the uh	2038	A
the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh Sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts	2038	A
making overtures to the Soviet Union and and into what we consider our sphere of influence and now we're we're in this dilemma over	2038	A
uh United States is believes in Democracy and and self-determination where and- but that on the other hand we believe in self-preservation and	2038	A
uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the influence- Soviet influence in in what's considered to be the United States' fear of the world which is not only	2038	A
you we used to see spheres but now we're in a situation where the United States is looks like we're it now	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
um-hum	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
right	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
yeah oh you can look in	2038	A
if- you- pretty- if you look at the region and and on to their detriment they came from uh this	2038	A
uh hundreds of years of Spanish control in the in the Spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who	2038	A
uh have been uh	2038	A
i don't know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good i mean if you go back to the kings and then the the conquistadors coming in and and the whole- the incredibly horrible things they did to the	2038	A
uh the native tribes i mean they make uh they make the things that Custer did look like uh like trivial and uh you get	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
oh absolutely and now- we set up	2038	A
and i mean Ted Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing and uh	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
right	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
i've the only the only thing i see about Cuba though is uh after Fidel Castro dies i don't think there'll be Communist power anymore i i can't see Communism in that country carrying on past him	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
yeah	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
right	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
yeah well i i don't know if maybe Communism's the right the right word for it but what we would there'd have to be some kind of there there may be a point at which at- at which you've uh	2038	A
you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh	2038	A
organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a Democracy	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
right	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
right	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
but cocoa leaves sell real low right now	2038	A
it seems yeah	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
absolutely	2038	A
absolutely i don't it's gonna be hard to um we've that's- you- that's- you- that's that's where you're absolutely right as we've got to do something in that region to encourage	2038	A
	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
right	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
	2038	A
yeah uh it's tempting it's got to be it's got be horribly tempting for those for those	2038	A
because_1 yeah yeah yeah you- it's not just- it's not just a matter of uh of having an	2038	A
extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of	2038	A
of feeding themselves their wife and their family and and you- there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family and there's dishonor in not being able to do it and-	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
oh no	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
um-hum	2038	A
<silence>	2038	A
right	2038	A
	2038	B
okay i guess we're on	2038	B
Central America have you ever lived in Central America	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
well there are those that that that think that that that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic	2038	B
importance particularly for the military interestingly enough my father was who was in World War Two	2038	B
and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain	2038	B
if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the Panama Canal he had worked with United Fruit Company	2038	B
there and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over	2038	B
and uh he turned them_1 down it it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is have you ever been there	2038	B
it's it's really i i haven't been there- i've been to been to Salvador and	2038	B
and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers that we went in fifty seven i guess	2038	B
and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite	2038	B
quite easily the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach and and and do we do we support the Sandinistas or	2038	B
or do we support uh	2038	B
you know when they thought uh they thought that Nicaragua if you gave them_1 a free election they would vote for the	2038	B
will you uh did- did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic i don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua	2038	B
uh and there were uh there's a big there's a big lake	2038	B
and um from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua but the the United States uh had some and i've forgotten what the political influence was	2038	B
but there were economic ties then the issue of of of if if it's in the economic interest of the United States	2038	B
uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh in other words do we make the world a safer democracy but if there's no economic benefit	2038	B
and i think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he's in Central America regardless of where he is	2038	B
is his life is his life better off under Communism or or uh or Democratic government you look at Salvador where the	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
yeah and and the question is is does the government make a difference if they'll mostly leave him alone	2038	B
uh and i think that's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it it reality doesn't make uh	2038	B
doesn't make a difference if he has no income and apparently even some of our alleged uh	2038	B
Central American leaders that uh are- are that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things so it's uh	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
it it's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and Americans	2038	B
have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
and uh we stole it fair and square i think is uh	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
well what's going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it	2038	B
the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh the idea of of uh	2038	B
what's the what's America's role there and it it uh	2038	B
with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened but you've still got uh Cuba that exception exerts some influence	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in Salvador	2038	B
where there is a significant under- under class	2038	B
 excuse me	2038	B
and that uh having a a a lot of difficulty	2038	B
uh surviving	2038	B
uh the question is would they	2038	B
you know would they be better off under communism	2038	B
and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the	2038	B
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all over the US is that that's essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them_1	2038	B
uh you know Communism would feed them_1 all	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
well that	2038	B
yeah if the guys got some incentive if he's got uh you know if- if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas	2038	B
to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
 yes	2038	B
as- as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
yes but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it	2038	B
well not that we could be bought but uh	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
well of course all everything we're saying is being recorded and	2038	B
	2038	B
of course of course	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
particularly if you're hungry	2038	B
<silence>	2038	B
 uh starve to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either and that uh and and and	2038	B
you know when somebody comes in and offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when	2038	B
when the uh religious organizations you know the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people	2038	B
and help them protect themselves not- not that they	2038	B
i'm i'm not sure the Catholic church is is is particularly- particularly political but	2038	B
you know if somebody's hungry-	2038	B
<silence>	2036	A
uh yes i- i used to work with a guy from Puerto Rico when i worked for Hewlett Packard	2036	A
 and uh he was a native and had gone to school there and got transferred to Colorado where i was living	2036	A
uh and he had some interesting times getting used to it um	2036	A
the United States the the language was a little bit different although he did speak English	2036	A
it was just some of the excuse me	2036	A
i've never been there my dad used to work for DuPont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there when i was in high school	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
uh-huh	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
uh-huh	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
okay	2036	A
uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month	2036	A
and uh	2036	A
i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and uh	2036	A
it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't want to go because she didn't play golf or tennis and there wasn't really a job for her there	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
uh-huh	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
right	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah i lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great	2036	A
i go oh it was just a place to live	2036	A
yeah i was	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
i- i think the status quo seems to be working i don't think um from talking to Jerry my friend that lived there that they don't seem um upset about it or anything and	2036	A
i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
i don't know fifty one stars on this flag wouldn't look too good	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to uh be arranged better i don't know	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah i don't know cut California in half or something	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
but um i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because they'll build plants down there because_1 they don't have to pay taxes on the stuff	2036	A
um and they make i guess it's no income tax there or federal- no federal income tax something like that	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
um yeah i think it's a territory	2036	A
that makes sense	2036	A
i mean there's uh lots of tiny islands in the South Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like Guam	2036	A
	2036	A
or uh	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah it's a U S territory and it's just we own it or	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
well Hawaii is pretty far too think about it	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
it's definitely a way out of the way where where as	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
uh-huh	2036	A
yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by	2036	A
which	2036	A
i don't know	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
	2036	A
no i don't think they would	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
but actually i knew another guy from Puerto Rico that i went to school with	2036	A
and he was coming he came to America to to go to school	2036	A
and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there	2036	A
he was really funny	2036	A
both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i don't know if that's uh	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not	2036	A
ones i met have been pretty pretty funny	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah i don't i didn't hear any major complaints about it um i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say okay you're a state now or you're your own country or whatever	2036	A
but um let them decide	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
yeah	2036	A
i think that makes the most sense	2036	A
hum	2036	A
okay have- we have we been on for a long enough time	2036	A
<silence>	2036	A
okay yeah this is this is actually the first time i've i've had someone call me so	2036	A
	2036	A
but uh	2036	A
it went fine	2036	A
all right well it was good talking to you Becky bye-bye	2036	A
	2036	A
	2036	B
so what do you think uh do you know any people from Puerto Rico	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
oh really	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
uh-huh	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
yeah have you ever been there	2036	B
have you ever been there	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
really	2036	B
no i've never been there either i've not known but just a few people from there	2036	B
one uh there was a girl in	2036	B
in my flight in in uh Air Force basic training actually who was from there	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
uh-huh	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
oh yeah	2036	B
	2036	B
it always sounds more	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
oh its	2036	B
i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is	2036	B
every- because i spent five years in Europe and everybody goes oh you're so lucky and i'm like well yeah sort of you know it's but having lived there it's not it's not anything like you picture it	2036	B
you know it's not it's like i still have the fantasies about Hawaii and all that stuff but	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
and your just like yeah well sort of right	2036	B
but um what do you think about about um their situation should they should they become a state	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
yeah	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
really i- i think	2036	B
i'm not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen you know	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
 where are they going to put the other one	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
	2036	B
well where are we where are we going to get another state	2036	B
	2036	B
 or Texas no that's not a good idea	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
oh yeah	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
	2036	B
oh yeah because_1 it's just a territory or is that what it's called a territory	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
okay	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
is that a U S territory though	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
that would be kind of bizarre	2036	B
that's kind of far	2036	B
	2036	B
well that's true but there is not a whole lot between here and there	2036	B
where you you start dealing with Guam it's like you know flying over all these other places to get there	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
	2036	B
My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two though	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
yeah	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
of course you could annex Cuba but they wouldn't like that a bit	2036	B
	2036	B
i don't think they'd go for that	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
um-hum	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
oh yeah do you think	2036	B
	2036	B
	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
no i have no idea but uh so you think that mostly they're they're pretty much satisfied with things the way they are	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
yeah	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
exactly	2036	B
really that's why i said you know when it when when their time is right when they're ready for it you know that it will come about	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
okay	2036	B
well Rick it's been good talking to you	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something don't they	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
oh okay	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
okay bye-bye	2036	B
<silence>	2036	B
	2036	B
	2094	A
uh Robert what do you uh think what substances do you think are the most uh likely causes of air pollution	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
right	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
	2094	A
do you um do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like air- acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial um areas factories and so on	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
i was going to say and and you so you understand smog	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
um-hum	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
wow	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
my word	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
and that was a few years ago	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
i- i wonder if it's any better now	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
because they uh California has such strict rules um about emissions and so on um	2094	A
i- i don't know if you heard- uh heard about the uh recent legislation in um Colorado um against a power company	2094	A
uh that's actually on Indian land i believe but um it has uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon	2094	A
and um in- particularly in the winter months so they it was uh a landmark case because it's unusual to um i can't think they they were talking about shutting it down or if it didn't comply and so on	2094	A
i don't know that the information is one of those wire services kind of news- pieces of news you know and so it's hard	2094	A
i never did see the full story so i don't know but they said that it that it really caused so much smog over uh the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing	2094	A
which would be horrible because the there's nothing i mean that's such a spectacle it'd be a shame to ruin it	2094	A
uh what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
 right	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
um-hum you think it's more well- more in society well i guess i kind of agree there i	2094	A
um on an individual basis there isn't a lot that we can do about a lot of things but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can uh	2094	A
force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it and i do think that we have a responsibility there i must admit i'm not always real politically active but i do think that	2094	A
um Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards and it's brought their the they uh really listen to the the uh lobbyist	2094	A
and uh the manufacturing- car manufacturing companies have uh you know have really pushed saying all those restrictions- those restrictions too hard we can't we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution	2094	A
um so i suspect that that's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators	2094	A
but um as a society i think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it	2094	A
uh individually- being individually responsible as- as uh in order to be group responsible	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
right	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
um-hum	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
i suspect that the public- that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen is for um	2094	A
governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't	2094	A
and uh i don't know how long that that'll take	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
sure	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
exactly yeah right	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
right	2094	A
 yeah	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
well it's just the same thing with the car um uh the gasoline now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't um run into this kind of problems we've recently had	2094	A
and yet the government's not going to do that because people are too dependent and they don't wanna they don't want to pay for it so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war um you know for- what- however	2094	A
it- it might have had other causes certainly oil was a big factor	2094	A
um and i think that's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution when we when we serious- get serious about cleaning up our motors in our automobiles then uh	2094	A
then maybe you know we'll have a little bit of help um uh do you have any air pollution in your area	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
oh no	2094	A
your talking about from from the uh the middle middle states that that have more factories and so on	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
yeah we really don't have that either although i think i can tell a difference in i lived in this area for about twenty five years and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level um particularly in the summer	2094	A
uh you know when it gets hot and you have the that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air um usually they say caused by exhaust	2094	A
it seems to me that i'm more uncomfortable and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on so i suspect that it's it's an ever growing problem	2094	A
well i suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here it was nice talking to you	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
so did i bye-bye	2094	A
<silence>	2094	A
	2094	B
	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
um	2094	B
gee i don't i mean i i guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust you know they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that	2094	B
so i believe them_1 but i'm not a chemist	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
i don't really know um i grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like i was victimized by air pollution	2094	B
i understand it very well and in fact i was a private pilot there	2094	B
and i can remember very etched etched clearly in my mind	2094	B
uh flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and and really being unbelieving at what looked like a uh	2094	B
it just looked liked peanut butter	2094	B
thick and brown and so on	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
this was quite a few years ago this was in the nineteen sixties	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
people say that it is somewhat better	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
right	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
hm	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
so did it burn coal	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
hm	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
uh	2094	B
i don't uh i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals um maybe	2094	B
just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing	2094	B
um apart from that	2094	B
i i don't know what we can do as individuals what do you think we can do	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah i guess i'm i'm to the point where i'm cynical enough that i really don't believe anything will happen unless unless there's something economically justifiable about it	2094	B
and in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else	2094	B
that we'll spend the money that's necessary to uh to get rid of the source of it	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
people also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it so if you don't want to burn coal for power how about nuclear- nuclear energy well we don't want that either	2094	B
how about investing in the sun well nobody wants to pay twenty five cents a kilowatt hour i don't think uh i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down it would-	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
oh yeah yeah yes	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yes	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yes	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
oh certainly yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
there's not really a lot here in Raleigh uh once in a while we'll get some uh i think it kind of washes down from	2094	B
uh the from your area Linda	2094	B
that's what they that's what they	2094	B
	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
yeah that's what they say but it's it's not it's not very usual and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
um-hum um-hum	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
yeah	2094	B
<silence>	2094	B
right i think we've given them_1 about seven minutes according to my watch and i enjoyed the conversation	2094	B
bye	2094	B
	2094	B
<silence>	2028	B
{weatherwise} or otherwise {weatherwise}	2028	B
damp	2028	B
cold	2028	B
warm	2028	B
	2028	B
we have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week	2028	B
we have had highs of seventy two	2028	B
lows in the twenties	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
i heard about that-	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
hm	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
um-hum	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
the blue flu yeah	2028	B
yeah the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work i guess	2028	B
oh we have had uh as i've said we've had variable weather uh	2028	B
it has been	2028	B
untypically wet for this time of year	2028	B
and also we have a lot of	2028	B
green you know the grass has been growing and	2028	B
if you look outside you	2028	B
would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and	2028	B
buy a new spark plug or something along those lines but fortunately it rains and you uh	2028	B
do not have to	2028	B
go out and buy the spark plug no but we've had an unusually uh uh warm	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
spring and well i guess we're still in winter and uh	2028	B
we have had no snow	2028	B
to speak of to speak of	2028	B
we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and	2028	B
this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation	2028	B
so it's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year	2028	B
so uh in that regard it's it's fine but uh	2028	B
i envy you you're at ninety four degrees i thought i heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
yeah	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
um-hum well i spent six years in graduate school at in Indiana	2028	B
in the flatlands and it was that way everyday	2028	B
rarely a day went by when the wind was less than	2028	B
fifteen or twenty miles an hour	2028	B
summer and- and winter so	2028	B
that uh we you you became accustomed to it i guess but uh otherwise	2028	B
we- as i said we have had a uh relatively mild	2028	B
winter for- speaking for this area of the country	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
Purdue	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
oh yes	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
	2028	B
well you are not from that area originally i can tell	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
oh okay	2028	B
 well	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
um-hum well i thought i heard a little Tennessee in there-	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
um-hum	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
gee you've moved almost moved around as much as i have	2028	B
	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
oh i see well i worked for the government so i i moved uh	2028	B
much more frequently than i had intended uh for sixteen years but	2028	B
i guess the uh this- this is my first conversation in this uh uh	2028	B
series	2028	B
i had- i received a call last night because of the uh	2028	B
i had not received my uh personal identification number	2028	B
	2028	B
so uh is there any i'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
oh okay	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
no i do not i work for GTE	2028	B
and i uh	2028	B
of course was i was sent a uh	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
an application from uh from Jack i've known Jack for sometime i'm in the	2028	B
speech processing business and have been for a number of years so i was very much interested	2028	B
in in being a speaker for this	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
oh i see	2028	B
	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
	2028	B
um-hum	2028	B
	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
	2028	B
i'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative	2028	B
and um	2028	B
but i have uh	2028	B
i have been an a speaker in other uh similar	2028	B
type of activities uh and i know the reason why this is why the uh this is being	2028	B
gathered and the program and so forth so i was interested in as i said i was interested in being a speaker	2028	B
	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
um-hum	2028	B
in environmental engineering uh	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
is that with regard to workplace engineering or just	2028	B
you know environment the work place environment or	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
oh i see	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
um-hum	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
well i had my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community the call i received	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
and so i had uh	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
i had thought a little bit about it um uh	2028	B
beforehand	2028	B
	2028	B
but that- that's interesting i have a um uh a friend who	2028	B
is a planner	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
uh a city planner	2028	B
and one of his and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling	2028	B
and one of the uh he has inputs or gets inputs from a an environmental engineer	2028	B
to	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
um-hum	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
oh i see	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
well that's interesting	2028	B
<silence>	2028	B
	2028	A
okay	2028	A
um how's it been this week for you	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
{weatherwise}	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
 hum-um	2028	A
oh no damp-	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
uh-huh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
my goodness well i don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then	2028	A
 it was ninety six yesterday	2028	A
	2028	A
yeah we set a record yesterday and uh very- very windy but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so	2028	A
very cool uh i think right now it's like sixty nine	2028	A
and that's cool for	2028	A
or if it- it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant no rain in the last month i don't think ground's very dry and	2028	A
our yard work everything- everything is in bloom so our yard work's pretty tough uh ground being dry but	2028	A
i guess it also uh brings about allergies we're having a lot of allergies down here right now	2028	A
everything blooming and and the weather and uh think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever	2028	A
too so had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh golf reasons and things like that	2028	A
yeah	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
	2028	A
yes	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
hm	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
hm	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
hm	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
yeah	2028	A

um-hum	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
yes yes it is down in uh more southern and- and- western areas and of course we're um about two hours from the northern border straight south and	2028	A
and uh very windy it's amazing to me because i've only lived in Dallas three years and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time	2028	A
it does i- i- i very seldom if any i can't remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind wasn't blowing	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
hm	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
uh-huh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh really- where did you go to school in Indiana	2028	A
Purdue i have a brother that lives in uh uh Southbend Indiana	2028	A
and i had to always well- i've lived there for eight years myself i'd always said i was gonna go back to school and go to Notre Dame	2028	A
but i didn't uh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
no originally i'm from New Mexico i was born in New Mexico and we lived in uh Southbend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh Tennessee actually	2028	A
and uh	2028	A
 very much very much because_1 i- i spent thirteen years there	2028	A
and uh then moved to Dallas about_1 three years ago so	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
 yeah	2028	A
it's uh uh uh uh my father was in the Air Force so	2028	A
uh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
uh-huh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh uh-huh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
right	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
yeah	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
it's um it's just as long as you want to i mean it's just a	2028	A
as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation now uh do you work for Texas Instruments uh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh okay	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh really-	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
yeah	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh actually- i- i work for Texas Instruments and um	2028	A
i'm in a i'm an environmental engineer	2028	A
and uh they just published this internally	2028	A
 you know getting people involved so that- that's really strange i i was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though i was thinking God do we have a TI in Maryland or	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
 um-hum	2028	A
	2028	A
oh well	2028	A
yeah yeah well really it uh	2028	A
 the the letter just says um	2028	A
	2028	A
 let's see i can't i was looking at it i was trying to find out	2028	A
 speedy short cuts and all it says not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it	2028	A
 when needed so	2028	A
okay	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
uh well it's actually um waste water taking taking care of uh i'm actually in the air division and we monitor um	2028	A
 anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building or	2028	A
um	2028	A
we do have customers that um	2028	A
their concerns are in the work place and we take care of that but in- within	2028	A
our department we uh take care of everything waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air	2028	A
	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh uh-huh	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh uh-huh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
oh uh-huh	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
um-hum	2028	A
yes	2028	A
<silence>	2028	A
uh-huh yeah we actually our division is corporate wide and we take care of just the Dallas area course we have several plants here but um we do air modeling also	2028	A
and and yeah i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area what we do we have a weather station	2028	A
that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed and wind direction and and uh we have a huge chemical data base	2028	A
and uh our our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site and and um it's concentration and and if if anything ever happened God forbid	2028	A
you know a building explosion or something like we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station	2028	A
<silence>	2083	A
so how do you feel about camping do you do it often	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
uh-huh	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
okay where where did you go there	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
okay	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
oh that must have been great	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah i use to live in Colorado and did did some camping up there	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
um well the best place we went was uh the great Sand Dunes National Monument	2083	A
yeah i just love that place i've gone there twice	2083	A
and uh it's really neat there's all kinds of jeep trails and the the dunes themselves and	2083	A
it's a lot of fun i like the place	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
okay near Mesa Verdes	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
right	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
okay	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
yeah i've done some of that	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
that's great	2083	A
yeah i've taken about four trips across country i'm originally from the East Coast but i uh took four let's see twice to California and once to and twice to Wyoming	2083	A
and uh most recently i've just been camping with in North Carolina	2083	A
and one of the best trips we took in last year we uh a whole bunch of us um packed up all the our gear in sailboats we sailed out to this island on the North Carolina Coast	2083	A
and it's it's a totally deserted island there's no buildings there at all	2083	A
it's not it's not really that big it's maybe four or five miles long and a mile across it's like protected water on the one side and the ocean on the other side	2083	A
and we sailed out there and camped and it was it was really neat	2083	A
because no one was there	2083	A
a little bit cold	2083	A
it's pretty it's kind of cold to to camp on the coast	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
the wind get's really bad	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
it's neat to wake up to go for a walk on the beach	2083	A
i mean most of time when you go to the beach you're at this real tourist trap and all these hotels and stuff and this was just like paradise	2083	A
you	2083	A
yeah we had sand pretty much everywhere	2083	A
	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
a lot of sand and having to haul all your all your stuff there in boats was was wasn't um it's more work than a backpacking because you had to worry about stuff getting wet	2083	A
yes	2083	A
yeah it rained on us on the way home	2083	A
i remember coming back into the uh port where we left and i had a cooler on my head as my hat and we we wrapped ourselves in garbage bags	2083	A
we were so cold	2083	A
but uh no one couldn't the last time i went camping- camping was over uh Thanksgiving we went camping up in the Appalachians	2083	A
uh-huh	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
okay	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
and we went and um this place outside of uh Winston-Salem North Carolina and it was really cold	2083	A
camping in in November	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
year	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
well North Carolina's fairly warm all year-round it it doesn't get much lower than the thirties but we're up in the when you get up in the mountains it's a little bit different	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
and uh	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
uh-huh	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
uh-huh	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
okay	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
some of the problem is you need a lot of equipment to do it there's a few things that you just kind of have to have or you can't go camping	2083	A
depending on what kind of camping your doing like a stove or sleeping bag and a tent and all that	2083	A
and like for the last couple years i've been borrowing it whenever i wanted to go	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah well that's that's	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
well	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
uh-huh	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
uh-huh	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
it makes makes you appreciate uh i guess the conveniences of modern living	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
	2083	A
yeah	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
okay	2083	A
<silence>	2083	A
good talking to you	2083	A
bye-bye	2083	A
	2083	A
<silence>	2083	B
okay	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
i haven't in a while but i do enjoy it when i get to go the last time i went camping was um in San Antonio	2083	B
Texas and uh	2083	B
um in a park Guadalupe State Park or Guadalupe River State Park	2083	B
and then i guess before that the last time i went camping was up on backpacking up on the Continental Divide in Colorado yeah for two weeks it was pretty fun	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
oh really where would you go camping	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh i've been there	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
huh	2083	B
um i guess in Colorado i'm trying to think of the place we went was in Pagosa Springs	2083	B
and we went up kind of in the Southwest corner of Colorado	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
yeah yeah because we went isn't Mesa Verdes where they have the the cliff dwellings okay yeah we went by there and then we went to on to Pagosa Springs	2083	B
and what- that's that's when we got the packs and and you had to put everything for a week on your back and there was no showers no nothing for a week it was pretty interesting	2083	B
it was quite an experience and this was in the middle of the summer and we woke up one morning and it snowed for about fifteen minutes	2083	B
but it didn't last any amount of time	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
wow	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
well that sounds like fun	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
 yeah	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
yeah i guess the wind and everything uh	2083	B
yeah uh	2083	B
i've never camped on the coast before i've always thought it would be fun	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
right	2083	B
did you get a lot of sand in your sleeping bag and everything though	2083	B
i can imagine	2083	B
sounds like that would be a mess	2083	B
	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
yeah i guess that's true too	2083	B
	2083	B
oh gosh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
oh no	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
God	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
um	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
oh hold on just a moment	2083	B
	2083	B
	2083	B
okay i'm on a cordless phone and every now and then i get interference and i have to switch the channel i can hear something weird in the background sorry about that	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
um	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
i guess so	2083	B
i guess it gets pretty cold in that part of country in November i mean here it's pretty unpredictable it could be cold or it could be really warm in that time of the year so	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
yeah	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
well it's been i guess the last time i went camping was well probably about two years ago	2083	B
um i've been wanting to since then i just haven't had much of a chance to a bunch of my friends went and camped up at the at a lake in Oklahoma once this last summer	2083	B
	2083	B
that was why but um	2083	B
i really i like to camp i just haven't had much opportunity to do it lately	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
uh-huh	2083	B
<silence>	2083	B
yeah	2083	B
yeah	2083	B
i guess really the most times i've been camping would i have- i would have to say it would be Colorado and New Mexico in that area	2083	B
just on a big group trip thing and i didn't have to come up with much equipment because a for the group we got all the stuff that we needed	2083	B
but um	2083	B
and that was boy that was a while back when i did that actually it's probably been ten years ago	2083	B
but it was quite i just can remember sleeping in this sleeping bag and waking up in the middle of the night just freezing cold i mean i just you couldn't stay warm at night no matter what and i was sleeping on my my down jacket with my pillow and	2083	B
sleeping in long johns and freezing but during the day it would get nice enough and then after that week of being up there i can remember coming back down to our base camp area at at the lake at Pagosa Springs	2083	B
and we all made a beeline for this pump because_1 there weren't any there were just outhouses and a pump and we all went to the pump and we were all washing our hair under the pump	2083	B
and it was so cold it must have been like thirty three degree water that just was all but frozen and it gave us the worse headaches we've ever had in our lives it was so nice just to at least get clean hair and we all jumped in the lake and everything just to just to rinse off	2083	B
it was quite an experience i've never gone for a whole week in the wilderness with with no you know no running water nothing so it was pretty pretty uh interesting experience	2083	B
definitely	2083	B
definitely i mean when you appreciate an outhouse you know you've been roughing it	2083	B
but anyway well five minute well actually we've gone more than five minutes so	2083	B
anyway it was good talking to you Rick all right bye-bye	2083	B
	2083	B
	3196	A
hello hello hi boy it took forever to find somebody	3196	A
good well i'm my name's Gail and i guess we have to talk about credit cards	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
okay well if you're ready then uh	3196	A
i'll	3196	A
okay i'll press one	3196	A
	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
okay well i'm not this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall	3196	A
 i just find it so easy to to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it and really trying to get out of that habit so	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
i think they're kind of dangerous	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
um-hum	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
	3196	A
yeah me too	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
um-hum	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
yeah that's true that's true seems just like our society is so um	3196	A
pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this they're really trying to get you into that uh situation because_1 they know they've really got you then	3196	A
so	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
uh-huh	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
uh-huh	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
 it's funny that uh we've got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago	3196	A
and we still owe i mean i- i think like half of the amount that they cost in the first place	3196	A
it's just uh you know you just never never get get it out	3196	A
and uh that's that's real irritating to have	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
uh-huh	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed	3196	A
for the truck and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills	3196	A
and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and it's gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them_1 you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time	3196	A
uh until several months later that	3196	A
we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were	3196	A
pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them_1 and so we charged them_1 all up again	3196	A
 yeah so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem so we were paying like twice	3196	A
um so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily but uh we're	3196	A
definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that i just it's so	3196	A
so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
um-hum	3196	A
yeah	3196	A
yeah	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
	3196	A
 yep	3196	A
 sure that's true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over her yeah what a mess you are	3196	A
oh so i don't know if i if i- i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and i just thought	3196	A
you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and	3196	A
so he said okay we'll keep it and then we weren't smart enough to not use it so	3196	A
now we just don't	3196	A
<silence>	3196	A
	3196	B
hello	3196	B
hello	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
oh well i'm glad you found me	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
	3196	B
yes my name is Carolyn	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
okay i'll just let you start	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
i think they are too and unfortunately um	3196	B
we use ours in we don't use them_1 all the time but we use them_1 like at Christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them_1	3196	B
like that but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them_1 in half	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them_1	3196	B
um that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think	3196	B
when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really	3196	B
get a lot more stuff	3196	B
if you were just able to pay outright for it	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
that's right	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like um	3196	B
we have a Sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well that's	3196	B
probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on	3196	B
at that point and then it seems like	3196	B
 takes forever to pay that off	3196	B
	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
wow	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
it sure is	3196	B
we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards	3196	B
and the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was you know to just have that	3196	B
we haven't done it lately we probably need to do it again	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
oh no	3196	B
	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
 oh	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car	3196	B
and uh if you could stick to that you know we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and everything else	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
 oh dear	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
<silence>	3196	B
you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though it's just like keep	3196	B
	3121	A
uh do you want to give a start on it	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-hum	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
oh definitely	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
 you can relate to that now see we didn't we don't have any of that because well like we live in the country	3121	A
in Clarion County and uh	3121	A
we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into	3121	A
so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh	3121	A
	3121	A
uh visiting habits of families and such uh uh	3121	A
yeah that there's less visiting done i think on a whole than there used to be used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not you went visiting	3121	A
and uh today you know people they do visit but it's not quite the same as uh what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
right	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
right right	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
the majority yeah uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
probably because when you work	3121	A
you don't really care to go out and visit as much	3121	A
and uh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
no huh-uh they don't do as much	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
you have to make arrangements or have an invitation or	3121	A
yeah yeah	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
well that could be part of it i don't know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so	3121	A
we really don't have that even we don't yeah	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
oh really	3121	A
oh that's pretty good yeah	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
well apparently there must be work available	3121	A
for those that are	3121	A
uh-huh because around here there's really nothing for the young people no good i mean there's jobs there's minimum wage jobs but uh to make a good living there really around here there just isn't too much	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
so well there's the main things i can think of i really	3121	A
tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really	3121	A
that	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
yeah definitely some good and some bad	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
they'd rather get their life started first before uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of	3121	A
effort and concentration and if you're busy with school it's i think it's really difficult for a family	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
right right	3121	A
yeah i know my my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh she has two little boys and they they've been in day care since you know one's four and one's one	3121	A
and they've done well now i wouldn't want to do it that way but uh she's quite happy and the children seem quite adjusted	3121	A
and uh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
uh-huh yes uh-huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh now i'm going to babysit my granddaughter she's just eight weeks old so this will be new for me	3121	A
so uh	3121	A
but the others i'm too far away to help them out at all	3121	A
uh well i have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh one in Maryland and one in Connecticut a son in Connecticut	3121	A
no but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and uh it's too far to you know really go too often	3121	A
Pittsburgh's not quite so bad it's just a couple hours	3121	A
Maryland maybe five hour drive	3121	A
that's	3121	A
uh-huh that's worse yet	3121	A
oh are you really	3121	A
do you uh stay overnight on the way or you	3121	A
you're young how old are you	3121	A
okay well you're young enough yet to	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
it's work to get there yeah yeah huh	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
uh-huh now my son they they flew he rebuilt a Aranca Chief airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it	3121	A
and it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane	3121	A
but they enjoyed in thoroughly	3121	A
so	3121	A
<silence>	3121	A
i'm not sure but you have to change phones you have to call from another a different	3121	A
	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement	3121	B
uh in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time	3121	B
and so i was very much a part of all the uh you know what was going on there uh	3121	B
my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now we've seen you know uh black people have a lot more civil rights	3121	B
in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago	3121	B
there's still a lot to be you know to be accomplished but	3121	B
for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
yeah	3121	B
well that's true	3121	B
that's a good one right there	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family	3121	B
and so we were always at family in different people- family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules are so busy	3121	B
mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work	3121	B
and so that means you know a lot of a lot of the social visiting and all was i think probably instigated by women at that time right and now	3121	B
that's right and now uh i mean my mother does not work and and she you know she's finds- finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women	3121	B
but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore	3121	B
there's a real	3121	B
right you know you don't want to you want to make sure it's okay or i guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles	3121	B
and that- and most live within ten or or twenty so but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and	3121	B
most people didn't go away i'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
yeah there is in that area	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
um-hum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social change- i use social change probably the job market has always- and the the economy has always affected uh social change	3121	B
probably	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
well i think just also you know	3121	B
the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change uh people marry	3121	B
yeah people marry later	3121	B
i mean basically i think now again where i'm from in in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school	3121	B
but now out here in Texas where i am now that's very unusual	3121	B
most people get married- i mean get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to	3121	B
be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
right but probably uh you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change because it affects child care and uh	3121	B
but	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
right	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties	3121	B
they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
where do they live	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
well they're not too far though	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
well i live like fourteen hours from home in fact i'm	3121	B
i'm driving tomorrow- i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
no i can drive it all it's just me so i can make it i'm thirty five	3121	B
although it's it's it is pretty i don't know i don't enjoy it that much it's pretty much like get there and	3121	B
it's just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just don't like to drive that far	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
when you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it	3121	B
<silence>	3121	B
oh	3121	B
	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
which which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have	3180	B
you know eighteen percent some of them_1 even higher	3180	B
and uh uh you know it it's some of them are almost uh usurious	3180	B
so	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
right	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
yeah it's like my uh ATM card	3180	B
 if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and it's down in the lobby i've got a these automatic teller machines then it's very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there	3180	B
but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars	3180	B
for that transaction which i thought gosh	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
 do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
yeah that's- well that's that's not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that	3180	B
when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me	3180	B
and uh	3180	B
uh	3180	B
you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money before it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card	3180	B
uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been uh quite so expensive	3180	B
<silence>	3180	B
	3180	A
something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didn't uh get too much built up on it that we didn't know it was out there but	3180	A
we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable	3180	A
uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off	3180	A
uh	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
right	3180	A
yeah it's it's strange that that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine	3180	A
i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because	3180	A
that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
right	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of your- all your purchases back	3180	A
but they had a uh a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee	3180	A
if you use it at a uh	3180	A
a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so that would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh	3180	A
that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i- i hardly i never have that i know of	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
um-hum	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
yep	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
and if you happen to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh	3180	A
the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's there's several opportunities to use the uh	3180	A
card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around	3180	A
and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them_1	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i- i guess i	3180	A
i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
hum	3180	A
<silence>	3180	A
yeah	3180	A
i guess that's the way they	3180	A
planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to uh	3180	A
i do seem to recall	3180	A
uh	3180	A
oh i- i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh	3180	A
gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places- places were closed it was after hours as it were and	3180	A
there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open	3180	A
okay	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
yes	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
right	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
oh mercy	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
yeah that that's too bad	3103	A
um um that's sad it really is	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
that's that's wonderful	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
well that's wonderful that speaks well of your mother	3103	A
she had high standards yeah	3103	A
oh bless her heart	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
challenges	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
right	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
surely	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie and i can uh relate to that uh	3103	A
uh i think it's it's the image that the woman has and uh in the world as uh	3103	A
uh the lesser of the two	3103	A
and uh i think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to	3103	A
like it to take and uh i think we are progressing at a snail's pace but we are progressing	3103	A
so that's the main point is that we are going ahead	3103	A
and uh i think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve and uh	3103	A
men uh have a lot of them have uh come around and have seen the error of their ways	3103	A
but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change so we have to uh face that reality also	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
it could be if they are after- they are not sure of themselves	3103	A
the one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves	3103	A
and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level	3103	A
and they do not have any uh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
ego	3103	A
uh problems that they are fighting	3103	A
and uh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term	3103	A
uh	3103	A
and i what i would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes uh	3103	A
we each have our uh jobs in life and that we should recognize that and that we should support each other	3103	A
and uh i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other	3103	A
and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
hm uh-huh uh-huh	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
well uh i guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us and uh	3103	A
the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands	3103	A
and i believe that strongly	3103	A
and uh but i think that they should be in harmony	3103	A
with what they are with what the subject matter is	3103	A
and i think the issue should be settled	3103	A
before there's a conflict	3103	A
<silence>	3103	A
uh and i think that can happen in a very wonderful- wonderful way	3103	A
and if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves can you picture that	3103	A
i mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself	3103	A
and uh	3103	A
that's really the the divine answer and and the right answer so uh uh	3103	A
that would be a beautiful	3103	A
relationship	3103	A
and i think there are some people that	3103	A
have done that and i have seen it and it's it's just marvelous and i am just in awe to see this	3103	A
<silence>	3103	B
all right well i am uh the product of uh	3103	B
i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone my mother uh we come from a my mother and i were uh really practice- first generation divorce in our family	3103	B
my uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty seven	3103	B
when i was seven years old and was i was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known to have a divorce	3103	B
of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States uh my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my father's side of the family and also uh	3103	B
uh	3103	B
uh we were uh ostracized by his family uh basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth	3103	B
and they all felt that there- there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce	3103	B
uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude	3103	B
 so uh yeah it was too bad it was really rough	3103	B
uh so you know that's so you know changing some of the changing roles of women in that respect i have been a product of	3103	B
um i think that there are people that i think that uh i was a i was first generation going to college in my family	3103	B
uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession- profession in Des Moines Iowa	3103	B
she was a secretary to uh uh the judge- uh to a circuit court judge federal judge and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him so that was a really high high status position she made over thirty thousand dollars a year	3103	B
well yeah she a real hard lady- yeah hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know	3103	B
but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees and i am the director of music in a church um and but it's interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with	3103	B
absolutely challenges that have to do with my sex uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know at professions	3103	B
as many of the woman- as many of the men who are doing the same job i do	3103	B
and uh the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly	3103	B
they question my authority more uh than they ever would a man and i have experience with this because i work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man	3103	B
so i am pretty i am pretty obvious- pretty constant- i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church so basically that's that's well i am done talking do you want to talk	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
oh always	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
indeed	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women i i have never been able to understand that i guess it's fear i- i mean what	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
sure	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3103	B
men have a lot of trouble with that though	3103	B
they in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals they are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower	3103	B
uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way and i do not know if that's i mean that's it's a militaristic point of view i guess you know somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but it's just really interesting to me i am married to a wonderful man	3103	B
you know who treats me very you know with a with as i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues	3103	B
it's never over you know it's always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and i am the you know and i am the slave and it those are the only only issues we ever fight about	3103	B
i think it's just i think it's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
um	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
um	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B

<silence>	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
<silence>	3103	B
<silence>	3157	A
i guess that's all i do	3157	A
yeah	3157	A
um well i was thinking	3157	A
how the government has changed over in uh Europe and Russia	3157	A
you know	3157	A
all those countries becoming democratic for one thing	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
um-hum	3157	A
i'm twenty seven	3157	A

<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
so it	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
and then i was thinking about how uh women's roles have changed	3157	A
uh	3157	A
i'm twenty seven by the way i was born in sixty four	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A

uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh that's true	3157	A
because_1 we might be liberated but now we all have to work and support ourselves and	3157	A
but uh it has it's pluses and minuses i guess	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
it's like a luxury now	3157	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3157	A
yeah it's hard work but it's like you have to have a husband that makes very good money in order to do that i guess	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh that's true	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
well like uh my sister's younger than i am and i think that uh like they're all um	3157	A
	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh it's scary	3157	A

<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
yeah i guess like in the sixties and the seventies i was	3157	A

uh-huh	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
unless they can get a cure	3157	A
unless they find a cure real soon	3157	A
for AIDS	3157	A
no i'm single	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
yes	3157	A
	3157	A
and uh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
can you think of any other social issues government um	3157	A
uh do you have any idea how long we have to talk	3157	A
oh i didn't even look at the clock did you	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
okay	3157	A
<silence>	3157	A
same here	3157	A
nice nice meeting you bye-bye	3157	A
	3157	A
	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
is that it	3157	B
okay start them off	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
oh yeah	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
well uh i don't know what your age is but i know when i was growing up that uh	3157	B
communism course the big threat of communism {McCarthyism} back in the fifties and	3157	B
and everything there we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to get us and now	3157	B
	3157	B
communism is no more	3157	B
so that makes a huge difference to us	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
uh	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
pardon me	3157	B
you were born in sixty four okay i'm older than that i'm forty four	3157	B
i was born in forty seven so i've got a couple years on you and i can tell you that things	3157	B
things have changed a tremendous amount for women in the world	3157	B
since i you know first started	3157	B
i'm not sure i i'm not sure they're better	3157	B
	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
	3157	B
that's true	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
yeah i feel sorry for women who truly do wish to	3157	B
kind of follow the the older tradition and stay home and raise their family take care of the kids and people say what you don't work	3157	B
well yes i work all day long thank you very much	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
yeah the cost the cost of living has gone	3157	B
just sky rocketed	3157	B
what do you think as far as the	3157	B
social morals the morals of people today as opposed to	3157	B
hum	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
i i i really do i feel you know i look back and i have two children i have a daughter who's fifteen and my son is twenty	3157	B
and i mean it's very scary because_1 they are living in a totally different time with totally different fears	3157	B
than i grew up in	3157	B
you know	3157	B
five years ago	3157	B
even ten years ago before the threat of AIDS entered	3157	B
uh	3157	B
i think things were people were even possibly more promiscuous	3157	B
because you know well it was live and let live and everybody have a good time and we won't even think about the consequences	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
i think the seventies maybe even the well in the eighties we started getting a	3157	B
a taste of it uh and people started saying whoa wait a minute	3157	B
and i don't know i think there may even be a turnabout	3157	B
in the nineties not immediately	3157	B
but as people become more and more	3157	B
terrified of the AIDS virus	3157	B
uh i think they're going to pull back sexually	3157	B
i think they're going to pull back and we may find the pendulum swings you know	3157	B
back the other way somewhat	3157	B
i i think we it has to	3157	B
or our uh we we won't survive our our world won't survive	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
uh	3157	B
do you have children	3157	B
you're single then you are in the midst of this	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
yeah it	3157	B
it's a different world for us	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
no	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
just three minutes	3157	B
<silence>	3157	B
oh yeah it's been three minutes dear	3157	B
okay i've enjoyed talking to you	3157	B
okay bye uh-huh bye-bye	3157	B
	3157	B
uh oh	3157	B
<silence>	3151	B
well how do you feel about spot testing- spot testing for drugs	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
um-hum	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah it's- it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these people that are against it that may they- yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they they call it an invasion of privacy	3151	B
and i don't see you know that to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for	3151	B
and they i believe that they have the right to know if you're using a a dangerous substance	3151	B
	3151	B
but	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
um-hum	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah no i i i agree that you know you there there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program just because you know you you- something can get mixed up in the mail or	3151	B
uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than than what you would expect them to and yeah you	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right and you know i've the the the company that i work for uh has just recently well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees they submit to a uh urine test	3151	B
and	3151	B
they they say that there've been you know they they they've also implemented random testing	3151	B
and it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that you know it's been in progress but uh i i fully agree with it and there's you know there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy and	3151	B
i i agree with you if if if you feel it's an invasion of privacy you've you've probably got something you're trying to hide	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
or the quality of their products	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
um-hum	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect	3151	B
hum	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
	3151	B
and then and one of the few that they don't have a cure for	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yes i do	3151	B
and i'm i'm down in the the central but i don't know how familiar you are with Texas but i'm in a we live in a town uh near a town called Temple which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right we're yeah we're probably about two two and a half hours south of him	3151	B
so	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
oh my it's actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday and it's cooled things down somewhat it's getting more humid now but	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
um	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
it's been about three weeks since we had any	3151	B
	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
hum	3151	B
wow	3151	B
how about that	3151	B
well i hope you do get some rain up there	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
but	3151	B
yeah i i i guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation you know	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
one of the things i found interesting it it's funny that you mentioned that TI is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world	3151	B
including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal	3151	B
and the policy doesn't apply to those folks	3151	B
 yeah they don't have to submit to drug testing like like they do here in the States and some places abroad	3151	B
yeah i thought that was kind of interesting too	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah i mean uh uh from from a quality standpoint that's not i mean just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
right	3151	B
yeah but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules i mean if if you know that's that's the trade off i guess	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
hum	3151	B
	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
right	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
	3151	B
that's right	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
yeah from the Middle East	3151	B
yeah Iraq Iran in that area yeah	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
well in in Saudi Arabia you know using uh alcohol and drugs and stuff like that you get the death penalty	3151	B
so it's pretty strict over there	3151	B
<silence>	3151	B
	3151	B
yeah yeah	3151	B
so that's	3151	B
i don't know i'm i'm i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy	3151	B
<silence>	3151	A
well	3151	A
basically i think it would be a good idea myself	3151	A
i uh	3151	A
i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh like i don't think one test positive should	3151	A
uh be uh	3151	A
the end of it you know i i think they should test more than once	3151	A
it	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
that's right	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum um-hum there's so many jobs that uh really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life and you know and it's uh	3151	A
uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it	3151	A
you know and i just um	3151	A
i i think there definitely needs to be some control to it i guess it is possible to have a false	3151	A
positive report	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
or somebody's test get mixed up with somebody else's i mean those things do happen	3151	A
uh i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined uh wrongly	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that uh doesn't require the testing	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
uh	3151	A
to me	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
it's to me it's not an invasion of privacy i think it's people have a right to know if if uh their their life maybe is in jeopardy or uh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
yeah their work the work they're doing for their company	3151	A
uh those things are all affected if not immediately it certainly does eventually	3151	A
i think that's where a lot of the problem is at first it doesn't seem to	3151	A
uh bother the quality of work	3151	A
but eventually it does	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum um-hum	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
course i feel the same way on the AIDS problem	3151	A
i i don't think that's an invasion of privacy that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for	3151	A
you know and it's destroying a lot of people's lives	3151	A
yeah and it's you know it's it's destroying people's lives and i i think	3151	A
that person plus anybody in danger should should be- know about it and be aware of it	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
so i don't know it's it's kind of hard to	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
i guess the the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy of course that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today i guess so	3151	A
 kind of get off on a tangent here uh do you work for uh Texas Instruments uh-huh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
oh that's probably way my brother did live in Grapevine Texas that's near Dallas	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3151	A
it's pretty hot down there probably	3151	A
yeah	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
oh did you really oh that's great	3151	A
uh-huh we we need rain real bad up here it's uh everything's really getting dry it's uh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
yeah it's kind of at a dangerous level here people hauling water and uh it's getting real bad	3151	A
so so	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um	3151	A
so do i	3151	A
uh i can't think of anything else uh	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
uh-huh uh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them	3151	A
i can see them objecting	3151	A
you know there's a lot of people that think there's nothing wrong with	3151	A
	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um um-hum um-hum	3151	A
um is that right	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
oh i'll be darn	3151	A
yeah yeah the different cultures and that too uh	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
no no i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way	3151	A
	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
oh yeah you can't you go by their laws	3151	A
the same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there that's why a lot get in trouble	3151	A
because they have to follow their rules and uh some of the countries are very much against drugs and	3151	A
you use them you pay for it	3151	A
yeah- yeah a lot of them yeah where where is it they lose a	3151	A
if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger is that where it is i thought wow you know that's quite a deterrent	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
yeah yeah	3151	A
yeah so i guess you know we really- we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great our country is	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
they they abuse it is what they do yeah yeah	3151	A
so	3151	A
<silence>	3151	A
um	3151	A
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
no	3101	B
oh yeah	3101	B
yeah i went and saw boat today i about flipped over it	3101	B
i'm not i'm not sure what kind it was i saw it just sitting on the side of the road	3101	B
yeah- oh yeah no doubt about it	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh yeah	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
that sounds neat	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
well- at least you have weekends off	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh i know i know i don't have that luxury yet	3101	B

<silence>	3101	B
it was out out in out in Garland	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah this one's big too	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh that'd be great	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
	3101	B
i think i could probably handle that	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
for awhile	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
well that'd be great	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
who cares about sanity though	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
i know it no telephone no fax machines nothing- nothing	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh that's true	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
well- that's good	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
seven that's about the right age	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
oh yeah	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah i sure do	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh really	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
huh	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
that's kind of different	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah i kind of i kind of enjoyed that boat i looked at today it's nice and clean it wasn't yeah it was not that old	3101	B
no it didn't it's open open up front had a little and it was open in the back too in the back kind of had a little	3101	B
deck in the back of it also	3101	B
yeah it was kind of different i thought	3101	B
yeah it was	3101	B
rather large- i do not know how big it was or anything i was just looking at it and until i got around to the for sale sign	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
uh fourteen thousand	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
uh pardon me	3101	B
no it couldn't have been that old it's	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
no i did not even- i did not even look at it i got around the price tag and said okay	3101	B
i said that's enough	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah i know it	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
um where do you all where do you all go skiing	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh i know it	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah that's true	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
uh somebody was talking about that at one time they were talking about uh	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
was it one hundred fifty a month	3101	B
something a hundred twenty a hundred twenty a hundred fifty a month oh i know it	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
well it yeah it is and	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah especially on water even	3101	B
 with some wood going around it	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah everybody's got to make a buck though	3101	B
the name of the game i think	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
working around the working around the water and take off on the boat anytime you wanted to	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah in it's truest sense right	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
well that's good does he know how to work on them_1 or just minor stuff	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
that's true	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
took took it in and got it got all of its shots right	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
right	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh i know it or that time off one of the two	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
yeah it helps it helps	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
oh i know it	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
man it's supposed to be	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
myself	3101	B
<silence>	3101	B
all right take care	3101	B
bye-bye	3101	B
	3101	B
	3101	A
okay do you have a boat	3101	A
do you like to boat oh yeah	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
what kind	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
oh a ski boat though	3101	A
	3101	A
we have a seventeen foot invader	3101	A
and yeah it's we've only had it a couple of years but it's so much better than the other boat we had a an older trihold that was just horrible because_1 i mean God you felt every wave	3101	A
but the uh the invader is really neat i really like it it's got the bow up and the bow down and all that stuff so it's kind of fun	3101	A
yeah so we ski every weekend	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
we didn't i think i'd go nuts	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
oh really	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
oh	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
oh well there's been one sitting up in Addison for the last few days that's really neat it's a Baja but it's huge	3101	A
i think it'd be more boat than i'd want right now	3101	A
huh well eventually my husband thinks that we are going to sell everything that we own and live on a boat in the Caribbean	3101	A
 yeah i think we'd kill each other	3101	A
	3101	A
well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah	3101	A
but i'd i mean i'd have to get away from him eventually but another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that and he said that they're just planning to take their bikes and then go into port every once in a while and	3101	A
say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
yeah i do not know if i could live on a boat	3101	A
 well i know what could make you insane floating around in the middle of the Caribbean	3101	A
exactly	3101	A
well that's another thing- good thing about our boat is going out on the weekends at least we're forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing	3101	A
so even if we do not ski but now that the water is warm enough we have been skiing a lot and my little seven year old nephew is coming next week so i guess i will have to teach him how to ski	3101	A
	3101	A
yeah i think that's about when i learned	3101	A
do you ski	3101	A
oh yeah do you have your own ski and everything	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
oh yeah it's a lot of fun my husband has a wet suit so he can ski pretty much year around if he if he has the guts to	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
but uh it was really neat last weekend we were sitting out in the in the boat and a a a school of shad came bebopping across the water and he threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast	3101	A
yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool	3101	A
so anyway	3101	A
yeah i was amazed	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
really did it have a cabin	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
oh really	3101	A
huh	3101	A
it must've been pretty big	3101	A
huh	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
 how much was it	3101	A
	3101	A
oh my i wonder how old it was was it very old	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
huh was it inboard outboard	3101	A
you don't know how big the engine was	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
	3101	A
yeah well ours will be paid off in ninety three and i will feel like i hit the lottery then i guess but	3101	A
it's pretty nice it's nice to have it's a good way to get away Kyle is afraid that he doesn't want me to to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is there's like a forty five degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
we go to Lewisville and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because_1 now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but	3101	A
it's really nice having it in the garage because_1 then if we want to go to Whitney or you know Grapevine or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go	3101	A
so plus i don't have any idea how much slip rental is it probably probably get a little expensive i would think	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
whoa	3101	A
i think i'll keep it in the garage	3101	A
	3101	A
 that's outrageous	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
just to have a place to park you boat	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
 that's pretty wild	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
oh that's true	3101	A
well that's what we were coming back from Arkansas i guess last October and there was a marina for sale	3101	A
and he said now that would be a fun job	3101	A
but yeah i can probably do that for a while	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
yeah you know hang out the gone fishing sign	3101	A
really	3101	A
i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems	3101	A
so but Kyle's real good with the maintenance i think that that's real important so fortunately he knows what he is doing there	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
well just the minor stuff uh we took it in for its hundred hour check up and all that stuff but you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good	3101	A
so that's fine i can live with that	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
yeah it's kind of like our only child now	3101	A
 well hopefully someday you will get that dream boat and-	3101	A
<silence>	3101	A
yeah really yeah you kind of need need them_1 to go hand in hand i guess	3101	A
yeah because_1 i mean i there's times you know even our weekends where we don't have time to go and it's sad because_1 you think God you are paying all that money for the boat and it's just sitting there	3101	A
so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go	3101	A
i hope so	3101	A
well i enjoyed talking to you okay maybe i will get you again sometime all right bye-bye	3101	A
	3101	A
	3149	B
okay start us	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
right because it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse	3149	B
yeah-	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
it already has	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
right although they are doing a whole lot more than they were five years ago you know they're living longer and and their medicines are a whole lot better so they're not having to go through as many of the as of the other diseases	3149	B
or so it sounds anyway as you know when when all of this first started out they they came down with every single disease that came down the pipe because they had no immune system and they suffered so much worse	3149	B
so you know at at least they're making progress but they've got to get it stopped they've got to find a cure	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
so have i	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
well yeah	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
well especially with you know surgeries all the time	3149	B
it's so scary	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
uh-huh	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
right	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
right	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah and you know well with the time factor it could be up to ten years	3149	B
you know so that's what's so bad and and you may test negative this time but you may test positive you know two weeks down the road	3149	B
so	3149	B
the test is relevant for that very day but not necessarily forever	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah and- and like when i went in the hospital you have to sign a paper saying that that you'll allow them to give blood if they if you need it otherwise they won't do the surgery	3149	B
	3149	B
so what do you do i mean yeah you're given the option of signing or not signing but if you say no i don't want the blood then they they may say well then i'm not going to do the surgery	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
right right what- what can they do	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
well yeah- that's right and they've got to do something about it they can't put it on the back burner	3149	B
and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because it's not there's no cure yet	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
you got it	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
of course i don't have that problem	3149	B
	3149	B
	3149	B
slight chance you think	3149	B
uh that's	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
oh it- it is it's like okay show me your papers	3149	B
then we'll talk	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah well they're doing a lot over in Europe	3149	B
with it	3149	B
and i know when Randy was so sick he was having medications flown in from Europe because_1 he couldn't get his hands on it over here and uh	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
uh-huh	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah so he was he had a lot of medication coming in from Europe	3149	B
and then he finally was able to get the what is it AZT over here only because he had connections that was not open to the public at that time	3149	B
so	3149	B
i don't know but they've got to do it because it's it's everywhere	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
to everybody	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yes-	3149	B
of course	3149	B
that's right	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
there's nothing to lose so you may as well do whatever you got to do	3149	B
yeah or if it was one of my kids	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
right no problem	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
little over two years	3149	B
little over two years and at that point he was the fifth fifth	3149	B
longest survivor	3149	B
but see that was almost four years ago	3149	B
and now they're living a whole lot longer	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
so but he i mean jeez he had everything under the sun he had hepatitis he had meningitis he got throat cancer	3149	B
and he never smoked even a grapevine much less a cigarette you know um	3149	B
just you name it he he just oh it was horrible it was horrible	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah and then i had another very dear friend of mine die four months after Randy did	3149	B
and uh he didn't know he was sick he'd just you know had a cold that he couldn't shake all winter	3149	B
and kept getting sicker and sicker and finally went in the hospital and uh had pneumonia and both lungs were full and he died within about sixteen hours of going to the hospital	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
yeah yeah and his friend had died the year before	3149	B
and they swore it wasn't AIDS but i know darn good and well it was	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
you know so	3149	B
ooh it's just that that's close to home	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
you're kidding	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
um my gosh	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
uh-huh	3149	B
<silence>	3149	B
	3149	A
okay	3149	A
all right well i guess you know i- i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem	3149	A
and if we you know and if it's not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're going to be	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
well that's what i think and it's going to start affecting all of the population you know i mean right now yeah you know and it's just going to become such a huge issue	3149	A
and it's just so scary that there's just not much that can be done at this point so i guess	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
yes	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
yeah yeah	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
right	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
well-	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
well i think so too and so i guess i would you know personally i would be really in favor of that now i have had um i have two friends who've died of it	3149	A
and uh so and those have just you know it's just been real hard and i just hate seeing people you know go through this	3149	A
so and i keep thinking it's going to hit our church eventually you know it's like uh it's- it's real interesting to me that we've not had anybody yet but you know it's going to just start affecting i think everyone	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
i know	3149	A
it is really scary you know i- i thought of that for myself for like for my children this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary	3149	A
because you know people don't know that's the thing there's a factor- there's a time factor in there	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
i know	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
i know	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
well that's right and i think you know people give blood innocently enough assuming that they're okay i don't suppose anybody would give blood if they felt they i don't know i guess they might but	3149	A
uh you know i- i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
oh	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
yeah really	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
there yeah right well because yeah then what are they going to do	3149	A
um they have no other alternatives i suppose um	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
well i i don't know i mean i just but then i think well uh yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because_1 that's going to sort of be the our only answer	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
well and i worry you know the older my children get the more exposure- chances of exposure they're going to have i mean i can't imagine well even for you being a single person i mean i think gosh how scary you know to meet people and	3149	A
uh you- you know	3149	A
	3149	A
	3149	A
 uh	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
 well you might you know eventually	3149	A
yeah that might eventually happen but uh	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
i mean	3149	A
 i mean really	3149	A
i know well it's just a it's just a sad thing and i don't know hopefully this is going to get taken care of at some point	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
oh this was your husband wasn't it that's right i've forgotten that you told me that but i'd forgotten	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
uh-huh	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
AZT	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
hum	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
well i know and and- you know and make it available to people that- that can use it i you know if i were sick i would try anything i think i mean what do you have to lose	3149	A
 i mean that's what's that's what's so crazy i mean what's to lose at this point	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
i would if it were me	3149	A
yeah i mean yeah you'd want you'd want everything available and then to think well it's available but you could- i mean you know you could only get it in Europe um	3149	A
would-	3149	A
would be a terrible	3149	A
that would be a terrible thing	3149	A
but um how long was he how long was Randy sick	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
hum	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
hm	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
so he was really susceptible	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
that's awful	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
huh	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
um-hum	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
um	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
um	3149	A
well in some ways that's a blessing	3149	A
i mean it's such a	3149	A
awful thing to suffer through	3149	A
well my	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
huh	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
<silence>	3149	A
well i know it is well my two friends both one one lived a fairly long time with it i'd say Ken had it	3149	A
well he thinks he had he was HIV for ten years you know i mean he no he thinks he had it even back in the early eighties um	3149	A
and then he died in eighty nine	3149	A
so and then Terry-	3149	A
 okay how's the weather been in Plano	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
right- yeah this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city	3185	A
uh well i don't know about you but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks	3185	A
and i'm ready for it to come back	3185	A
well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty five when we woke up and sixty six	3185	A
and today and i when i got up the the temperature said more like of course seventy nine or eighty	3185	A
so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
you don't are you a summer person	3185	A
are you	3185	A
well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i- i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as the	3185	A
my husband's from Nebraska and they have more of the four seasons	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
oh you're used to that too	3185	A
you don't like the cold well i usually like it about sweater weather and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long it goes from hot and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer and then it's cold	3185	A
and i wish it were several months of that	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
	3185	A
 no	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
oh yeah	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
well sure it does that kind of schedule you really need a lot more sunshine	3185	A
and also the evenings are going to be getting uh darker sooner	3185	A
because as it gets cooler	3185	A
but i did a walk last night and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
 well i agree absolutely and you know it's all relative because i was from west Texas and it was very dry and so i thought Dallas was awful	3185	A
and i still think so but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week and it was so humid there	3185	A
that your um all your windows were were wet every morning they had to get the squeegees and clean them off and when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because_1 it's kind of like what you're used to but i agree with you the humidity especially for curly heads like me	3185	A
yes i do not like the humidity	3185	A
	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
um-hum	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does	3185	A
so uh but i- i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like i guess my my best would be probably	3185	A
sixty eight when you wake up or sixty six and then probably seventy five during the day	3185	A
yeah yeah are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds	3185	A
yeah so	3185	A
yeah just keep it there	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
yeah	3185	A
well i do too i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of	3185	A
negative on it but then we started thinking especially in Plano the weather is so hot in August that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow	3185	A
 static here	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
yeah	3185	A
we do too i think a lot of people agree the same	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
 uh-huh uh-huh	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
uh-huh now there have been worse summers in fact this morning when they were talking about uh Harold Taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder	3185	A
of the summers	3185	A
and milder fall everybody seems to be you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because_1 they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're just	3185	A
 melting and then you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings and we'll it'll be too cold and they'll say well those are the ones that like the cold weather	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
oh yeah he did he did it was it was really a shame he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them_1 did	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
oh is that right okay	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
oh good	3185	A
<silence>	3185	A
well good well then have a good day and i hope you enjoy the weather this week	3185	A
	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
 basically about the same as what you've probably had	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
oh you like the rain do you	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
oh are you i don't care for that as much i'm a summer person i like the heat	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
yeah and i'm from Utah so i- i like the four seasons i just don't like the cold	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
the thing the other thing is the i don't like the rain either	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
 well we have several children that are in sports and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on	3185	B
so	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
i like it better that way um-hum	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
the thing about when it gets hot here is i don't like the humidity that i really don't care for that	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
oh really	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
oh is that right well another reason well i guess i can't say that it	3185	B
i don't like the rain completely we have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden and you know even i don't know	3185	B
if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain or it seems they thrive when it rains they just really	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
um-hum yeah	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
well	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
well i like seventies i like seventies okay	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
oh i don't like nineties you can give me seventies and you can give me eighties and i'm okay but when it gets too hot then it's that i don't like that i stay in the house because it's just	3185	B
it's just too hot	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
that's okay um i've i've thought about that too and um when we take our vacations we we do take them_1 in August sometimes so that we can be away from here	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
it just really gets way when it gets way too hot it's	3185	B
and we've been here for several years and we've been here years when it's been hundreds	3185	B
and	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
years um-hum	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
yeah	3185	B
yeah he he always did such a good job i thought	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
a good weatherman	3185	B
<silence>	3185	B
yeah	3185	B
anyway um	3185	B
i guess it's	3185	B
that's okay they say when you're done you're done so yeah i you don't have to wait for them_1 to say you're- cut off your time you just say have a good day or whatever you say you too	3185	B
you too	3185	B
okay talk about uh what kind of restaurants we we like to go to and what uh makes us go back and i'll start talking about it so	3116	B
usually i just kind of like uh places that are family style kind of things because_1 it's a a casual atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff and and uh	3116	B
 but we were in California recently and i went we went to a couple of very uh i guess expensive extravagant restaurants because_1 it was kind of the thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like	3116	B
and we got to get some real good food more exotic and uh we thought that the service was very good	3116	B
and uh that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even though it is expensive you know like maybe once a year or once every six months go to it or something like that	3116	B
but how about you	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
 yeah	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
um-hum	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
um-hum	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
um-hum you know what we have around here too is uh a place where you uh you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself	3116	B
yeah and they they have everything else cooked you know but baked potatoes and all that but you you pick your meat and you know whether it's marinated or or just regular	3116	B
and uh then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself you know and then have all the stuff to put on it you know like if you want to	3116	B
i don't know butter on it or whatever or garlic and stuff like that	3116	B
you can you can do it that's kind of interesting it was really good	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
yeah we we thought that was that wasn't too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these	3116	B
fancier restaurants and and i thought uh i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because_1 you know you see all these things like you see all these chef's chef's shows and stuff like that	3116	B
and uh and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if that's any good you know it looks kind of small but actually it wasn't bad at all	3116	B
you know when they have like seafood dishes uh but it's just kind of kind of sparse with different things put in it that that really uh	3116	B
that really taste pretty good you didn't you wouldn't think it goes together you know	3116	B
but uh but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family family type of things you know	3116	B
because_1 it's uh it's easier to go with two kids two young kids now	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
right right	3116	B
yeah that's true	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
well i think uh some of the things that i liked were uh	3116	B
uh well i would see the food and whether or not it tastes good uh the service if they're you know courteous or if they just kind of are hasty you know if they just get your order and go and you never see them_1 again or they coming talk- you know talk with you a little bit or something	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
	3116	B
yes i have we have we have noticed that	3116	B
yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when they're oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know	3116	B
to occupy them_1 you can really tell	3116	B
the other thing i've liked too is uh now this isn't you don't have this at at family restaurants but uh is some type of a like a a pianist or something	3116	B
that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
<silence>	3116	B
there was two places that we went to one in San Francisco and one in uh in Monterey California	3116	B
and uh the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you could- had a great view you know of San Francisco and everything	3116	B
and uh and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because_1 it was overlooking the water too	3116	B
so that was that was a couple things that we liked	3116	B
but	3116	B
okay you have anything else to say	3116	B
	3116	B
okay well thanks a lot	3116	B
 okay	3116	B
bye-bye	3116	B
	3116	B
<silence>	3116	A
um-hum	3116	A
 yeah i- i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work	3116	A
so it's something that i end up kind of experimenting with with my girlfriends or maybe taking my girls out when he's gone and	3116	A
and so we end up usually finding something that's uh quick service and uh that's hopefully economical and uh	3116	A
certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre	3116	A
um as far as to really go out for an evening though i do like to have a place that's	3116	A
not real real formal but kind of on a formal side just because usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and it's real relaxing and then	3116	A
uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so	3116	A
um i guess my favorite kind of foods- foods would be uh the ones that	3116	A
 well i don't know favorite is just going out for a good good hearty steak but	3116	A
i- i- i find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak houses it doesn't seem and i- i find that amazing being in Texas i'm from another state originally and	3116	A
i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state	3116	A
and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
oh really	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
huh	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
huh	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
yeah it's kind of an interesting approach	3116	A
so	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
yeah yeah	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
um-hum um-hum	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
yeah that's what we have too yeah and yeah you do have to kind of decide well are we there to get a good meal and and just	3116	A
be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesn't work with kids	3116	A
so what would make you go back to a good restaurant	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
um-hum	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
and do you find that when you have children that it's it really makes uh you can really tell the difference between a good and a mediocre restaurant by the way they treat you with kids	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
um-hum	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
oh yeah	3116	A
yeah we have a restaurant over here called Gershwin's that has a piano player always during your mealtime and it	3116	A
it just makes for a real classy feel and uh it kind of carries over the conversations next to you so you're not concentrating what someone else is saying next to you but i mean but you know at the next table but	3116	A
just within your own little group so it makes for a nice nice place to go	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
oh yeah	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
well sounds good	3116	A
<silence>	3116	A
no i think we covered everything	3116	A
well thank you for being home okay bye-bye	3116	A
	3116	A
	3140	A
hello	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
hi Nola i'm Steve i'm in Dallas Texas	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
no that's unusual seems like usually	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
oh yeah i think all mine have been East Coast people so far	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
so	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
social changes	3140	A
what's that mean	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah i yeah i definitely i mean there's plenty of things to talk about there that's a	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah sure	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
uh i was hoping that you would but oh	3140	A
	3140	A
yeah social changes is that uh	3140	A
it seems to me that uh	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
does uh	3140	A
yeah like a lot it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
so	3140	A
that-	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
it's like people are starting to give up hope and they start out	3140	A
very poor let's see that's a bad tangent to get on what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties	3140	A
and the nineties no	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah it seems so that yeah that is a pretty big change it seems	3140	A
even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like	3140	A
some of these even ladies that that'll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work you know well that that i mean that's very young for a baby	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah i mean they're going to like you said i mean there-	3140	A
there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah- yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
huh is yeah is the thing how uh home study is that what you said home school is that uh is is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
oh is	3140	A
oh well you sound busy	3140	A
so you're teaching them completely huh	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
that's pretty sad because	3140	A
i mean	3140	A
i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
changing people's expectations	3140	A
<silence>	3140	A
<silence>	3140	B
hello my name is Nola i'm in Plano Texas	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
not too far away	3140	B
	3140	B
i've had some from Plano too	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
uh-huh	3140	B
okay um let's see	3140	B
social changes	3140	B
uh sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties i guess	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
think we can handle that	3140	B
	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
	3140	B
okay uh shall i go ahead and push one	3140	B
okay	3140	B
	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
you want to go ahead and start	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
that involves a lot of different areas i think	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
yeah there is a a big difference in the uh economic	3140	B
um status of uh people although i think that has been true uh always um	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
um	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
i think uh	3140	B
my- in my situation i have three children and we're uh home schooling so education you know things that relate to- to education um	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
are things that i think about a lot um i think that and i think that involves	3140	B
social changes a lot	3140	B
uh for instance	3140	B
i think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that	3140	B
are happening socially in the world around them and in in to- because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather	3140	B
more not than are and children being put in day care centers from very early and and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the	3140	B
day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes	3140	B
because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn and they're not um	3140	B
they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have and they don't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and	3140	B
deal with the things in the world	3140	B
and uh i think we're seeing a lot of	3140	B
rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
gang things that are happening and and um	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
yeah oh	3140	B
that's really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and i i think that if they didn't that	3140	B
and- and it became more of the standard not to	3140	B
that uh i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
that's right	3140	B
it's already	3140	B
it already costs society much more because of it you know it trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know	3140	B
um there's and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of two parent	3140	B
um	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know	3140	B
rather than that she has to have the money particularly or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
you know	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
home school	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
no we're i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way	3140	B
	3140	B
yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think	3140	B
home schooling's always been around but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems	3140	B
a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it it's really obvious	3140	B
to look at them and watch the way they act and things that um	3140	B
they've been raised in a day care center	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
well i think it's going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base	3140	B
it's the basic unit	3140	B
and that's the where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better	3140	B
and educating uh you know	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
i know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what	3140	B
<silence>	3140	B
family life is like and the uh you know	3140	B
and uh that kind of thing but um	3140	B
	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
do they feel that way	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
 well i- i think it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to to the drugs i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it it's uh i don't know i don't really liken it	3174	B
to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think it's a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them_1 or get you off of them_1 because you're	3174	B
i don't know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them_1 into some sort of a	3174	B
program to get them off of drugs i would think that is that how they do it at TI maybe that	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
well	3174	B
	3174	B
	3174	B
you you have people out there that are responsible for certain things and you expect them to do their job and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job um as they might do	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that whatever they're taking at the time and and it would be uh	3174	B
you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the schools so i've you know had a	3174	B
they they talk a lot about drugs there and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools	3174	B
but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs you know and	3174	B
	3174	B
if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart and i don't know how many others are	3174	B
doing that and and i think that's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age and uh	3174	B
 i don't know it's just a problem that problem- no one is sure just how to handle i think	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
really it's that high	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
oh	3174	B
 i didn't realize it was that expensive	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
um-hum just lucky to have jobs	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
 i just i didn't think it was that expensive because_1 my son was in probably a week and a half period and Sam's and Wal-Mart are are	3174	B
owned by the same people he took one for for uh Wal-Mart for job hiring and then Sam's called him and and he took another one and i you know i don't know why they both	3174	B
made him do that since it was so close together i can see if	3174	B
because you know if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted	3174	B
<silence>	3174	B
well maybe they run i don't know you know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health	3174	B
type program that it it it would catch a lot of things i- i just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them	3174	B
uh i work at TI and we have um of course started drug testing um random drug testing here and um i haven't gotten called yet but um	3174	A
i feel that it's probably pretty- it's pretty good	3174	A
if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at TI but i think our latest statistic- statistic said something like ninety nine point	3174	A
nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the drug- on on all the testing	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
right	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
right	3174	A
	3174	A
right i at TI if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program and um you know you go through the program and then	3174	A
you're called like six months after you complete the program- program and if you test positive then you're terminated	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
yeah uh-huh	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people if they're if they're not uh you know fully functional	3174	A
mentally while they're doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to other- another people um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
oh yeah	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
so right	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
right	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
oh yes um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
you know i think personally i'm for it there's	3174	A
several reason why i- i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it	3174	A
and yes and oh yeah it's very expensive and um um-hum it's not like a normal urinalysis it's very expensive to run them and um	3174	A
i didn't get a raise this year because nobody in our company got a raise	3174	A
but yet their they spend all the money on drug testing and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise so see there you know there's different	3174	A
i don't think that that's that i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem and i know that but then i have other views to it	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
right	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
their- their's might not run a thousand dollars our from what i understanding here at TI they run close to a thousand dollars an employee	3174	A
	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
<silence>	3174	A
but no for all the the	3174	A
oh it's	3174	A
	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
okay you have three boys i had two boys and two girls	3127	A
my youngest is college age but he is so he's still around occasionally but um he's he's twenty two and in his last year of college	3127	A
but uh we were very active with them when they were young whatever they were in gymnastics or soccer or baseball or basketball whatever we were always involved in the parent club and	3127	A
coached some and went to all the games and	3127	A
and course in Plano that's a big deal we'd even where we lived in Albuquerque before there's a lot of parent involvement in children's lives	3127	A
how about where you are	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
oh	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
oh my	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
right	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
oh dear	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
yeah he's learning from the big brothers huh that's neat though and sometimes those that see their older brothers do it turn out to be pretty good because they pick up skills	3127	A
 seems naturally you know just they start so young just kicking the ball and are are you pretty involved with with their uh	3127	A
do you coach them_1 or go out to parent nights	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
oh	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
right	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
right	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
right right it- well that's seems to be a a pretty current trend i i work in the schools and i see a lot of kids that	3127	A
obviously are looking for a family and usually find it within a group at school rather than	3127	A
at home because their parents are off working or uh usually- you know a lot of times it's a single mother trying to raise and of course i i deal with adolescents so that's where it fourteen fifteen that's where it really starts coming out this	3127	A
lack of of uh family life	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
well uh they look for their security and their uh self-esteem uh outside of the home and usually in the wrong groups	3127	A
and and uh	3127	A
right and they find that they're very easily unfortunately uh the kids who make them feel the most welcome	3127	A
when new students come into school are the kids that are are uh on drugs or party a lot on weekends and things like that and and uh	3127	A
they're the first- but they are the first ones that will come up and say you know you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you to your classes and things like that and and uh	3127	A
when you've got a a child that's just coming from a situation a move is a terrible thing on a child it's it's just such a traumatic especially if they've lived for any length of time	3127	A
in- in the first place and they come up here and no friends and here are these people just throwing themselves and before you know it you've got a a kid involved in things you don't want them involved in and	3127	A
and most of the time the move is made and then mom and daddy go right back to work right away and the kid's coming home to an empty house or they're coming home to take care of little brothers and sisters and and uh you've got these ready made friends just ready to go	3127	A
and and uh i you- i don't know	3127	A
what the answer is because i am a working woman and and i don't like to say if the women would stay home any more than i like to say if the men would stay home and and it's	3127	A
right when-	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
when my youngest was in third grade i went back to work but i stayed home up until then when by that time my oldest was	3127	A
oh she's about	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
six years older than he is so she must have been in about uh	3127	A
tenth grade i guess my oldest was and i had one in tenth and one in ninth and one in eighth and then this third grader and and uh	3127	A
but i went to work for the school district where i was home in the summer i had two weeks off at Christmas i got- left school at three- four o'clock every day and was home	3127	A
to take them_1 to anything they needed to go to in the afternoons	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
uh no in the schools i i uh i did work some summers but it was never my work never took uh first place if if my kids needed me or needed to go somewhere that's where i was	3127	A
and	3127	A
um i when my youngest was in elementary school i worked at in his elementary school for three years	3127	A
and uh but i had an understanding with the principal that under no circumstances was i to be treated any differently i don't want i said i don't want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldn't get to anybody else's mother in the middle of the day	3127	A
that that it would be handled the same way they handled- dealt with other parents- other kids	3127	A
it it gets real easy when a mother is in a school or a father even for a teacher to	3127	A
every time some little thing goes wrong to run and pretty soon all you're hearing is negative things so it you know and those things need to be dealt with in the classroom by the teacher and not tattled necessarily	3127	A
but it it	3127	A
it worked well	3127	A
it worked well with me and i and i told the principal i said if if uh my student my child does something that you feel deserves licks or some other discipline have at it you know i'm i'm i have always	3127	A
wanted them to respect rules and teachers and and uh	3127	A
i don't want them to think that i'm going to come riding to the rescue where every time something happens but	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
right	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
well i think unfortunately what what we're seeing in the very few of the instances is that	3127	A
uh for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the day their idea of parenting is	3127	A
to come riding to the rescue and take their child's side without knowing	3127	A
the whole story or even when they do know the whole story	3127	A
it's it's either another student's fault or it's another it's a teacher's fault or it's- it's anybody's and they	3127	A
consider that being a good parent and that what if when really what the child needs is their attention more of the time and it's	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
<silence>	3127	A
it it it's and it's- it's difficult i understand i i know a lot of single women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kid's head and keep food on the table and i don't know how these women are supposed to have	3127	A
time to to parent it's- it's i don't i don't know what the answer is to it it's it's really sad i there may not be i but it- it beats being it beats being homeless you know and	3127	A
	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
that's good well i try i try to as much as possible um my oldest is nine he plays plays soccer and is getting ready to start playing football	3127	B
and uh i'm behind him a hundred percent on that and	3127	B
and my my middle one is five he's playing soccer and T-ball	3127	B
my youngest is two and he wants to do it all so	3127	B
yeah- that's that's right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
that's true	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
i try to be as much as i can	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
oh no i i uh go out to as many games as i can get to	3127	B
it's kind of hard- hard hard with me just because_1 i'm in the restaurant business and i have to work weekends but my wife's there all the time and	3127	B
mean that's that's one of my that's my downfall on my side of that that that aspect	3127	B
which is i think's a lot of people's too	3127	B
just in general	3127	B
is that is there that- everybody's working you know the the dad's away at work and then the then the wife goes away to work and kids are stuck with sitters and they're not involved in there as much with their- their with their kids they let somebody else raise their kids	3127	B
what	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
what do you what do you what difference do you see in those kids that than ones with a mother and father in the participation	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
really	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
acceptance	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
yeah	3127	B
wrong side of the fence	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
oh sure i mean the	3127	B
it	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
that that's right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right well you're fortunate that uh your kids are grown and i mean did did you did you work when your kids were growing up	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
did you work in the school or in the administrative end of it	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
it	3127	B
	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right just-	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
did you work at the same school that your kid was going through	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
well it puts you it puts you in an awkward situation puts the child in an awkward situation	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
well they need to i mean any- any child as far as that goes there's that there's that certain there's that that fine line between A and C you know that you have you need to ride and all kids do they they need discipline	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
right	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
well that's usually what gets them_1 in trouble to begin with not enough attention- not enough attention like you were saying they go off into the wrong groups and get hooked up with the wrong people so	3127	B
<silence>	3127	B
you don't know if there is one	3127	B
there may not i mean it's just an ongoing- ongoing problem right	3127	B
	3135	B
okay do you have you ever had to put your children in in child care Mary Dell	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh i see	3135	B
oh well i have uh a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool	3135	B
and uh we've just been real lucky i think anyway to not	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
right like half day programs uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh my gosh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
right right yeah	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here	3135	B
you know to your lucky to have an art teacher and if you do you get them once a week or something you know	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh is that right i had no idea	3135	B
	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to	3135	B
not going to change anytime soon	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten	3135	B
you know it's like wham culture shock it's just	3135	B
yeah yeah get the computers out and you know well that's hard it's so difficult for them um	3135	B
did you have your children did you say in home in in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh so you were able to have somebody come there	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
yeah yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
oh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh gosh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh i have uh a	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the Home Show but they were talking about uh	3135	B
a new uh oh i can't even think of the name of it i was halfway listening while i was painting um it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children	3135	B
and they've now moved it to Washington DC and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there	3135	B
you know so um	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh boy that's great	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
right right	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
 yeah	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
gosh it's amazing	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
right right	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly	3135	B
why the government makes the decisions they do	3135	B
you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
right	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
right right	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh that's good	3135	B
that's good to know i got a couple of friends that have have found the uh	3135	B
you know a private- a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they	3135	B
usually you know you'll find a a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
oh too transit uh-huh	3135	B
<silence>	3135	B
and her surroundings too yeah	3135	B
	3135	B
	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now	3135	A
i worked even when she was a baby	3135	A
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist	3135	A
right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place	3135	A
so it worked well how about you	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
yeah	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong	3135	A
preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas	3135	A
but they were so seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it	3135	A
and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that	3135	A
the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there	3135	A
so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and	3135	A
real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that	3135	A
that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
or pay for it after school our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and	3135	A
you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools	3135	A
rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah	3135	A
well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
yeah yeah put the colors away which is too bad	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house	3135	A
and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so yeah-	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
yeah	3135	A
well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money	3135	A
and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead	3135	A
so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so	3135	A
i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
um-hum	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
um-hum	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
yeah oh that would be hard	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or	3135	A
are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time	3135	A
for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint	3135	A
we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just wean- wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again	3135	A
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but	3135	A
i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast	3135	A
and for our age group it's too late too little too late	3135	A
but i i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
right yeah	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
oh sure	3135	A
you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that	3135	A
well- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces	3135	A
so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
<silence>	3135	A
well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area	3135	A
and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year	3135	A
and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to	3135	A
	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
yeah is that like Visa and and MasterCard	3170	B
do you have department store credit cards too or	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
uh-huh	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
appliances	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
right	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
my my husband and i do basically the same thing but we we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise	3170	B
we still pay it off every month if it kills us but we do it mainly for you know the cash flow what is that	3170	B
oh float that's the word float and i often will keep track- track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already	3170	B
and sometimes just and keep a list and make sure i	3170	B
i don't go over a certain limit especially around birthdays you know	3170	B
oh	3170	B
if we go out to a restaurant oh just to float it or i don't know	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
yes my husband has a	3170	B
uh	3170	B
or anytime like a plane ticket or you know	3170	B
even if we have the i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it but	3170	B
the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that	3170	B
that thirty days or whatever	3170	B
 we have a new one from AT&T and we have you know haven't used that one too much be interesting that's nice because you can use it for a calling card also	3170	B
it's a MasterCard too so it's kind of fun uh but you get a lot of junk mail about them_1	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
 yeah you're such a a wonderful person	3170	B
 we'll give you five thousand dollars up front	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
right do you have uh uh an annual fee on yours or do you get yours through a bank or	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
yeah i- i can't see paying an annual fee for it i mean i almost	3170	B
<silence>	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
	3170	B
good talking to you thanks bye-bye	3170	B
	3170	B
 basically um my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases we really don't get into small little purchases if we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but	3170	A
other than that it's not something that we use a lot of um	3170	A
we may have only two or three versus um i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or uh up to a dozen credit cards but um ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh	3170	A
use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
uh yeah one Sears	3170	A
Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do um	3170	A
appliances and things like that and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that so	3170	A
but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate if you've got the cash to pay for something it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two three month period but	3170	A
if it's uh	3170	A
any large purchases um you've got to kind of think about um how much you're going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off so	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
uh-huh	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
yeah yeah	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
uh-huh sure sure	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
uh-huh	3170	A
sure so you know	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
sure	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
exactly exactly yeah-	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
or if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it so yeah	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
um-hum	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
um-hum	3170	A
sure	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
oh sure for the month or whatever	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
exactly	3170	A
so	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
uh-huh yeah	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
exactly sure	3170	A
sure yeah	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
oh yeah and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh your credit is great so let's send you another credit card or it's preapproved for	3170	A
such such to entice you to get more credit cards	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
and so you know we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
uh ours is through a bank yeah we had it a long time ago through a banking system so yeah just a but	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
oh you're already paying them uh if you're if you don't pay it off within that month interest anyway so yeah that's exactly it	3170	A
so okay	3170	A
<silence>	3170	A
okay all right thanks a lot by now	3170	A
	3170	A
	3158	A
okay well some of the things i like to do are i like to knit i knit sometimes and i sew	3158	A
and um	3158	A
i like to sew sometimes for my kids i- i sew clothes for them every once in a while and i make quilts so	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
after a while cross stitch i think- i don't know i have to put it away and then i have to bring it back you know and and uh	3158	A
i don't know why that is i don't know if it's looking at the little things- little things every time	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah that might be it that might and yet there's uh	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
oh do you	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
oh	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
oh i bet	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah yeah	3158	A
um i've not really done any too much challenging um stuff i- i can do it with a a needle and thread you know	3158	A
but uh and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good but it's very long	3158	A
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group you're not finishing a quilt in a long time	3158	A
so uh	3158	A
so um i like to just mostly do the tie quilts that's so much easier	3158	A
but uh the other ones are very pretty they're uh we have a quilt on our bed that's uh instead of like yarn	3158	A
they tied um ribbon into it	3158	A
and it's real pretty that's real pretty	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
oh wow	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
uh-huh	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
uh-huh	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
now did you say you could knit	3158	A
oh	3158	A
well i was gonna say because_1	3158	A
because_1 if you could knit you could crochet it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to	3158	A
to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand	3158	A
and then you just use your right hand with the hook	3158	A
and that's not it's really not too difficult you could learn that i'm sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet it's not too difficult	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
isn't that interesting	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
i think that's really interesting	3158	A
huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns	3158	A
that people do	3158	A
and i- i just think that um	3158	A
that's one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty	3158	A
and a lot of people don't do that either	3158	A
you know and so	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah yeah	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
 yeah that's true you know and and i always think well i can do this while i watch TV or something you know	3158	A
and um it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else and then it doesn't	3158	A
quite work or	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah and	3158	A
you know i like to sketch i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that	3158	A
and that's nice and everything	3158	A
but you know it's funny i can't i can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing i wish i could and and yet i can't do you know like like uh craft uh on wood	3158	A
i can't do that painting thing and yet	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
yeah me too	3158	A
me too i know a woman who's just wonderful at that and	3158	A
and i look at it and you know you look at those things and you wish so badly that you could do them_1 i guess	3158	A
if you wanted to you could take classes and learn i guess that's the only way i could do it	3158	A
<silence>	3158	A
	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
oh wow that's the next project that i'd like to learn to do i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery	3158	B
and i'm i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch and was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
it gets boring	3158	B
um-hum um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
well it just reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think	3158	B
but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from Plano to Dallas	3158	B
so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car	3158	B
i don't know that i could even think about quilting	3158	B
you have to have a pretty good frame don't you to do any kind of quilting work	3158	B
hm	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
oh i bet but it's such a lost art	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
uh-huh yes	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
 oh	3158	B
i bet	3158	B
there's so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother she had crocheted a full bedspread it's kind of a hobnail looking thing	3158	B
and when i look at it now she's been dead for a long time i think oh why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that	3158	B
people just don't know how to do	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
no um-hum haven't tried that either	3158	B
i wanna learn to crochet i	3158	B
really	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
yeah yeah	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
uh-huh	3158	B
it's funny when you were talking about sewing i love to do anything by hand with a needle	3158	B
but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine i never learned	3158	B
and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
well it's hard to find the time	3158	B
i- i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or	3158	B
just not sitting down at all	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
well and i'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary and so i find myself putting glasses on to	3158	B
to watch TV and then taking them_1 off to do needlework and i get frustrated doing that so just give it up	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
ooh that does-	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
uh-huh	3158	B
yeah i'm the same way if i see something i can copy it but i certainly can't create i admire people that have that in their minds already	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
<silence>	3158	B
well sometimes even with that yeah- i- i think you have to have some	3158	B
	3188	B
yeah this is a great topic for me because_1 i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal	3188	B
two little deals the first one um i helped someone repaint an apartment and it was very easy	3188	B
yeah and i've never painted anything- i always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it and the second one was i bought some toys at a um	3188	B
	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
well it's uh it that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't it was a oil base so i had to get and when i painted them_1 i	3188	B
didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind	3188	B
well no you can use it on wood but i just had it all over my hands and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water you have to get the uh a solution	3188	B
and	3188	B
yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um	3188	B
 uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just used- we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up	3188	B
yeah and and it it just like the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know it says safe for children and all that	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
yeah	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
have you painted anything recently	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
wow was it huge	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
uh-huh	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
yeah	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
wow	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
yeah i think though um we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because_1 i don't know if i could you know i don't know i don't know must be difficult	3188	B
no it was just- it was really easy i just like what i we had a couple of different size brushes and it was-	3188	B
you know real easy i went around the trim and if it- and there was wallpaper like i was doing- just doing just the trim of the around the doors and windows and there was wallpaper and	3188	B
 if we got it on the wallpaper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off so there was no major mistakes there was	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
uh two actually um and it there was um you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
well yeah if you just you know we didn't tape anything we weren't that careful but it wasn't you know i don't know it's it's funny it's like if you just go slow you don't get or at least i didn't get that many	3188	B
mistakes i didn't make that many mistakes	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
why just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it before-	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
 well it wasn't if it was my own i would've but my friend said oh just go ahead you just go ahead it's easy i said okay it's your place	3188	B
well a couple of weekends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and	3188	B
no there was they were doing all sorts of repairs and there was i was just painting because_1 i don't know how to do anything else so there's a whole bunch of people yeah	3188	B
so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
yeah	3188	B
<silence>	3188	B
but you know i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said oh get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true	3188	B
but i didn't realize what you know a pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex i don't know if it's worth the shine-	3188	B
 so have you done any painting projects lately	3188	A
	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
oh really	3188	A
what kind of painting was it	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
uh-huh it was it	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
yeah	3188	A
oh huh	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
uh-huh	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
 oh well- what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
uh-huh	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
so you can't use oil on wood	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
oh so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
oh	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex	3188	A
hm	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
uh-huh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center	3188	A
and uh and- the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff	3188	A
so uh she had that done but uh	3188	A
well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing uh that you keep some um farm equipment in	3188	A
and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer	3188	A
and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner	3188	A
but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so	3188	A
yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
 well what about the trim in your house did you have to do that	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
uh-huh	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
oh yeah	3188	A
did you have uh one coat or two	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
yeah that would be really time a a time saver	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
um-hum oh me i would've had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then i'd have probably rolled it on i'd uh it would've taken me forever	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
yeah well the first time it'd probably would've {tooken} me forever so	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
 well how long did it take y'all	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
so there was two of y'all	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
 well that's easy enough	3188	A
um	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
	3188	A
<silence>	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
<silence>	3113	A
okay well i uh i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers i'm not a lawyer uh that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure	3113	A
and i i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to uh uh they can find guilt or innocence	3113	A
uh but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
uh-huh	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
yeah because_1 i find that uh i've been on a few juries and uh as a say i i tend to be around uh civil cases	3113	A
because i've been an expert witness some and uh	3113	A
many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to uh come up with the fair value uh	3113	A
or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is	3113	A
uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime	3113	A
uh that uh when i only do something one two or three times i'm hardly an expert on it and	3113	A
most juries	3113	A
over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three	3113	A
and so how do you relate as to whether this	3113	A
particular armed robbery was a you know worth five years or twenty five	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
yes	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
yeah	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
well one of the others things that gets me on on the juries is that often in the newspaper	3113	A
i i tend to hear two things well that go on one is you often see in the headlines	3113	A
the big numbers	3113	A
uh and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed	3113	A
by a judge or an Appeals Court and that never makes the the press and so when uh you or i as an individual	3113	A
gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines	3113	A
uh and we don't have uh again a lot of knowledge so we don't know what is really going on what is uh	3113	A
really the range of sentences or awards that are uh are actually uh in the end applied	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
yeah	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
well that's where uh uh the role of juries is is restricted and uh i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it one is it's restricted in the sense that	3113	A
juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if it's first degree rape second degree- degree rape or whatever	3113	A
they only get to decide on that well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape uh and you can decide guilt or innocence on that uh such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's uh premeditated or	3113	A
one or two of the lesser degrees and- the other thing that juries are restricted on and and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my even in my own experiences that you	3113	A
usually don't get to hear all the information it's what information is presented and	3113	A
uh i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story	3113	A
when they have to decide guilt or innocence	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
yeah and the truth that's brought out is uh as i say when i've heard about you know the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth	3113	A
is that they want uh they don't want uh the whole truth i mean you can say yeah the because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the of the truth	3113	A
<silence>	3113	A
<silence>	3113	B
okay	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right i agree too i don't think the jury should be the ones that that put the sentencings down i think the judges should or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point	3113	B
might be better apt than just regular civil people	3113	B
not knowing you know exactly what things are from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
yeah and	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right that's yeah and- and and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes or you know what whatever the case may be and and may not have any idea	3113	B
of what what the standard punishment would be for it and it they may have some different idea i mean it might be more important for them to put a sentencing- sentencing- sentencing down that was uh	3113	B
longer you know that didn't fit the punishment didn't fit the crime	3113	B
or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be	3113	B
i i think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it the only thing i worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and	3113	B
you know sometimes might have- have more pull which that does happen i mean we- we can't say it doesn't because it does happen i mean not everybody is is you know	3113	B
has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically or	3113	B
whatever the case may be and sometimes that's not real fair either though so	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
um-hum	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right right well well also what i don't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in and and his attorney	3113	B
gets his sentences sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like i don't know what assault or something or	3113	B
but which that doesn't make any sense to me either i know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot and and and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't i mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff and they they're put on like	3113	B
they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime	3113	B
then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know	3113	B
have the same thing happen that's that's not right	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
um-hum	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
yeah	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there	3113	B
 so the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information don't they	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
they only put part of it	3113	B
yeah	3113	B
<silence>	3113	B
right well that's just like that old witness game well it's a game kids play too but um	3113	B
somebody did it just ah	3113	B
just for your train of thought where they they showed something	3113	B
and they asked there there there were uh like four people	3113	B
<silence>	3148	B
okay um	3148	B
in Plano	3148	B
yes where do you live	3148	B
oh okay	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
huh	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
um i was trying to think uh something we were watching the other day and they were doing	3148	B
an overview of Los Angeles uh from an area that was up higher and you literally could see the band of smog that uh i've never been out there but	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
it was it was quite evident that	3148	B
it was a real brown area and	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes well i know uh that's been the concern in Europe they hadn't uh we have friends in Germany and uh	3148	B
have family that live near the Black Forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we	3148	B
switched- uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars	3148	B
uh that's something that Europe didn't do right away and now they're doing that and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found	3148	B
that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there it's not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of	3148	B
um i guess from from something that the car was	3148	B
um	3148	B
was giving	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes and	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes yeah	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yeah i i get that sometimes um my line gets some static i don't know why	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
well and i would think in our um we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and uh oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal	3148	B
oh i don't know what to usually it's the other phone i have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me	3148	B
okay	3148	B
i don't know what uh	3148	B
i i don't know what the problem is but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that uh	3148	B
there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days and and it yes it can be used and it can help but uh that was a problem that they were still	3148	B
working on but	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
what-	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
uh i hope so	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
	3148	B
well i do think um i mean you've already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there's a problem and more people are interested in uh	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yes well and and for the future generations too uh	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yes	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
<silence>	3148	B
<silence>	3148	A
where do you live	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
in Plano	3148	A
in Dallas	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
uh the air pollution isn't too bad in our area so we're very fortunate but	3148	A
i know in some areas it's really it it really is bad	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
i haven't either	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad particularly in the areas where there are industries uh	3148	A
where they are burning a lot of coal and oil up more up north i guess uh i think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution antipollution devices i think the	3148	A
air isn't as bad as it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
from acid rain	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid	3148	A
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time i think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots	3148	A
as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad	3148	A
what's interesting several years ago i took a course	3148	A
uh on uh well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and	3148	A
how much pollution there was and there wasn't from various kinds of of energy and uh	3148	A
at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh-poohed you know oh you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing	3148	A
and it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage	3148	A
so it's kind of interesting the change in	3148	A
perspective	3148	A
from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear uh i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use	3148	A
is not bomb quality and we're so strict with all our controls in the United States the chances of of an accident are slight and it doesn't pollute the air at all it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant	3148	A
many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants it's kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
so i don't know in Europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become uh bomb quality	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
but that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there's some problem uh pollute the groundwater	3148	A
so i don't know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or uh fusion or something clean well we've got a problem on the line don't we	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
but uh	3148	A
solar of course would be the clean cleanest	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
i can't hear you at all for all this static	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
now i can again	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
oh yeah it it's still got a long way to go	3148	A
it's just you know a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways it may not in all ways maybe they'll come up with fusion	3148	A
you know control- be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but	3148	A
	3148	A
one of these days because that's perfectly clean	3148	A
it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isn't not at all and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so that's not going to work	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
at least not now but uh	3148	A
who knows what the future will hold	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
uh as far as energy goes i i think	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
with solving some of the energy future energy problems we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
i do to	3148	A
i like to be optimistic i don't like to be pessimistic about these things	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
we have one earth to live on and we got to take care of it	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
<silence>	3148	A
i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth	3148	A
and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems	3148	A
i'm afraid	3148	A
i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't so many of them didn't people didn't care you know it's whatever	3148	A
you know recycle well if it's a problem forget that uh not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away	3148	A
how horrible you know now i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes uh and create-	3148	A
	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
are are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the	3154	A
other containers yet for recycling	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
well maybe they don't i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah the	3154	A
that's going to be interesting because it's uh we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is	3154	A
uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage	3154	A
so that i don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where uh	3154	A
uh it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people	3154	A
uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh	3154	A
growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery	3154	A
would candle them and package them	3154	A
is that uh in the fifties	3154	A
uh you could say we had	3154	A
the recycling going on then that we should have now	3154	A
which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got	3154	A
a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
oh	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
so uh you know i look back at	3154	A
at uh my	3154	A
childhood and i'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this	3154	A
uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper	3154	A
uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans	3154	A
uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh	3154	A
i don't have any habits there yet and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction but	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
but it just seems like on the larger scale that	3154	A
you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if uh	3154	A
if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect	3154	A
uh than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so	3154	A
outside my little town	3154	A
we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
i well that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
the carton the paper carton	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
well i mean the you- you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood	3154	A
uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty four bottles and	3154	A
and uh	3154	A
uh i'm not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now	3154	A
well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh	3154	A
doesn't really like the paper sacks	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise	3154	A
uh oh i'm i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh	3154	A
Neal's a person who says i like to pick it up but i don't believe in throwing it into the uh	3154	A
the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us don't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh	3154	A
to do that	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
uh so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
well there's someplace you know if it's because_1 really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty four hours	3154	A
uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh	3154	A
so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's	3154	A
it's certainly usable material	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
<silence>	3154	A
right	3154	A
but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when it's one thing to send grass there but i've trimmed trees and other things which uh	3154	A
end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly but it's still natural and i just don't know	3154	A
	3154	B
okay	3154	B
well let's see well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for	3154	B
glass and	3154	B
glass and uh plastics and uh we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full i guess we collect milk- milk cartons and	3154	B
whatever plastics- other plastics are acceptable	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
no no i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
right well no i haven't seen any so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and i'm	3154	B
kind of anxious to see them	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
oh right	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
right	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
right	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
oh	3154	B
oh of course that they did you know actually we had milk delivered to our house	3154	B
in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house	3154	B
you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there so uh	3154	B
yeah	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
right right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it it it stays i mean it's just	3154	B
to see stacks and stacks of newspapers	3154	B
just to the trash is just amazing so uh	3154	B
you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty well there's a pretty- pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics	3154	B
so that's kind of encouraging i didn't know you know i- i didn't know if we started to do that i didn't know what to expect	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
right	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
 well i guess they will shortly i guess	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
oh right	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
	3154	B
yeah	3154	B
right do you know i saw in Tom Thumb yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small Coke bottles	3154	B
and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
they were glass they were the glass uh well let's see they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or	3154	B
six ounce or ten ounce	3154	B
sort of a small size	3154	B
sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack	3154	B
stick them down you know uh sort of of sort of a basket type thing with the divisions right right so i just hadn't seen that in a long time	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
yeah yeah well	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
no he doesn't like the paper sacks and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't doesn't just	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
right right	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
that's nice i guess they dump it the same place i wonder where they dump that the same place	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
yeah yeah well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in they have this day now that it's you know separate from the other trash pick up	3154	B
um	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
no	3154	B
<silence>	3154	B
<silence>	3128	A
hello	3128	A
hi my name is Leslie	3128	A
hi Carol where you from	3128	A
oh you're kidding so am i	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah you're not from choir are you	3128	A
	3128	A
 Leslie French	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
uh Christ United Methodist	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
oh okay i'm in the soprano parts	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
well i have too i have too and i	3128	A
oh i guess so i've only had uh one other chance at this thing and	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
we're supposed to discuss food and cooking	3128	A
and uh did it describe it to you at all	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
okay well and it says uh which foods would you recommend for uh a menu for a dinner party	3128	A
and then maybe we can share a recipe with what they kind of what it kind of said	3128	A
uh yeah	3128	A
 okay let	3128	A
i'm pressing one right now okay	3128	A
okay well i was thinking about if i did a dinner party right now i'd do a Mexican- Mexican fare of sorts because_1 that's about the only thing i'm creative at and uh	3128	A
well for appetizers i'd start with the you know the typical cheese nachos and uh melt the cheese over the chips and uh put some green pepper or i mean chili peppers on top of that for those who like it hot	3128	A
and then another good good um recipe for appetizers is uh bean dip i don't know if you've ever done that but you put just the uh refried beans and then a layer of uh	3128	A
of sour cream	3128	A
 well it doesn't really have seven layers mine doesn't anyway and then i put like a layer of cheese and then some salsa on top of everything and then you just use it for dipping your chip into and	3128	A
yeah it's real good and then a	3128	A
probably go with fajitas	3128	A
uh season up some good chicken and beef and chop up a whole bunch of things so that they could kind of pick and choose what they like and	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah yeah	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
that's right	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
so i haven't done many dinner parties though lately i've just been uh	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
um-hum	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
um-hum	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
oh	3128	A
yeah that's me too	3128	A
in fact we don't even have our dining table yet so i guess we've been pretty casual for most of everything so	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
well speaking of dinner parties are we still doing this uh um	3128	A
yeah we	3128	A
you know what i was planning on doing i didn't know if it was needed but was a salad	3128	A
i mean that's i didn't know if it had to be a casserole of sorts	3128	A
okay	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
okay	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah yeah	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
that's right yeah it's kind a	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah yeah well that's that's my my love of if i'm not going to have a full meal is to make sure i get a good salad in there and a good you know thing of fruit and that that'll satisfy most anybody so	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah okay how long we supposed to talk on this about three minutes i hope	3128	A
	3128	A
yeah okay well then if we're done it's all we do is just say good-bye right well	3128	A
yeah i'll get	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
yeah yeah sounds good nice talking to you bye-bye	3128	A
	3128	A
<silence>	3128	A
<silence>	3128	B
hello	3128	B
hi Leslie i'm Carol	3128	B
uh Plano Texas	3128	B
oh well we're right here in town then maybe we know each other	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
uh oh	3128	B
Leslie who	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
okay what choir are you from	3128	B
well of course i'm the little short one that sits on the end by Judy Dillon	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
you're a soprano- well i well we can chitchat easily without any sweat then	3128	B
what a hoot i i'd forgotten about this thing i have been so bad oh good	3128	B
obviously it's working now i should-	3128	B
i will do better	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
well okay Leslie- what are we gonna discuss Leslie	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
fine	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
well it i was hunting for all of my stuff and every time i pressed a button they were already talking by the time my phone clicked back in	3128	B
i have a cordless phone that doesn't do well	3128	B
	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
great we can do that i don't care what you serve i'll let you go first you're in charge of the call you ready to press one	3128	B
go	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
what kind of things would you put on it	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
um-hum	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
oh that seven layer dip	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
okay	3128	B
okay you	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
that's a wonderful recipe	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
what would you use for your main course	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
oh yeah	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
that's an easy way to please everybody	3128	B
that way if there's something that they don't want then they can just simply leave it off on their own	3128	B
that's a good idea	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
well i'm a very casual informal person so most of my quote dinner parties	3128	B
would probably be very laid back we'd probably do ribs or chicken or	3128	B
something like that on the grill put with corn on the cob and maybe a tossed salad fresh fruit that type of a thing	3128	B
i'm a i'm a lover of paper plates in the summer time and disposable plastic forks throw them away for an easy cleanup	3128	B
so i	3128	B
i'm afraid i'm not a real fancy sit down kind of use your best china	3128	B
dinner party kind	3128	B
	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
well my life is kind of casual so my dinner parties would be also	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
well what's a good potluck for eight to ten people what do you	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
it can be anything	3128	B
it can be anything i i may just bring fresh fruit because i know everybody will eat that even though it's not	3128	B
you know someone'll bring a meat	3128	B
if not	3128	B
we go meatless i don't care yeah we don't we don't we eat too much too much meat at dinner parties anyhow	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
i think they always go over well	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
i think we've probably discussed all they need to discuss	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
okay i've enjoyed talking to you and i if i have a Mexican dinner at anytime i'll do i think i'll run your yours by and have fajitas and bean dip and the whole nine yards	3128	B
okay i've enjoyed talking to you bye	3128	B
<silence>	3128	B
	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
well Nancy uh as- as i was talking	3112	B
my brother uh his name is Ainsley and he was a conductor in New York City of a Goldman band and they did park concerts at the Lincoln Center	3112	B
uh during the summer season uh they were free concerts but he was with that group for like twenty one years and uh did both very traditional marches a lot of you know John Phillips Sousa and	3112	B
uh all of and Franco Goldman in fact the name of the uh the band was because	3112	B
one of the famous uh march composers of all time uh Richard Franco Goldman and his son Edwin actually i may may have those reversed father and son	3112	B
started the band like seventy years ago i think so it's the oldest organization really of it's type in the country	3112	B
and uh my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years	3112	B
so	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
well i was able to uh to hear him about three years ago for the first time at a a concert there and uh it was quite enjoyable um	3112	B
in that uh he also had one of the composers- well actually there were two of the composers that he used were actually there at the performance also	3112	B
so i got to meet them and in particular i got to go to the rehearsal before hand	3112	B
and that was when i realized how good he really was was at a rehearsal as opposed to an actually performance of uh working with the musicians	3112	B
and- and one of his biggest struggles uh with the band was that this was all union musicians	3112	B
which didn't give him a lot of leeway once they were in the band	3112	B
uh he had a very difficult time replacing them no matter how they were performing at that particular season	3112	B
and uh he ended up with some very unusual characters in that that organization it was easy to tell that just from the rehearsal time	3112	B
but uh anyway what were you going to tell me about your dad	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
oh	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
uh-huh	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
uh-huh	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
oh yeah i- i was in the band in high school and that	3112	B
i played the clarinet	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
and uh so i- i did that my all through high school and then i guess my first year in college i played but it wasn't a marching band it was just a it was a symphonic band	3112	B
and uh ironically in college the marching band was part of the athletic department rather than the music department	3112	B
	3112	B
oh	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
right	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
uh-huh	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
a tuba- tuba	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
right well does he bring the tuba home to-	3112	B
oh my goodness	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
yeah just anything i have a niece that plays the harp	3112	B
and she found the same thing that uh she had i think what they call a troubadour harp for a while and that she learned on and trained on but then uh	3112	B
uh a harp became available which there just not very many instruments uh and a used harp became available in Colorado and they lived in in uh Missouri at the time	3112	B
and they actually drove to Colorado to buy this instrument but they first had to go and buy a full sized	3112	B
station wagon	3112	B
uh so they'd have room to bring it home	3112	B
and that's dictated their cars every since then just having one large enough for a full you know concert harp	3112	B
that she plays	3112	B
uh	3112	B
well i uh because of my brother's uh work with music for a long time he was a	3112	B
uh a critic for the Music Journal	3112	B
and as a result of that he	3112	B
well that was part of the reason he ended up with this incredible classical album uh library or collection which i have now inherited	3112	B
and um	3112	B
i- i don't listen to in nearly enough it's the same sort of thing there's so much music that i recognize but don't who is yeah who is the composer	3112	B
but i've	3112	B
based on just measuring number of inches or in this case feet of albums that i think i have about a a uh two thousand album classical record collection now	3112	B
so i figured that uh i could probably listen to a different album every day of the year for about seven years	3112	B
 if i wanted to at this point	3112	B
but then it's hard to find a place to stack that much music	3112	B
most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room	3112	B
but uh	3112	B
anyway	3112	B
um	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
well he really did uh i know that he was a critic probably in the early sixties in New York City he had um	3112	B
we were thirteen and a half years apart i think and he left home at like sixteen to go to Westminster Choir College	3112	B
and you know he did not finish high school he just went straight- straight to Westminster so i never really remember having lived at home with him	3112	B
and after he did get out of college it was not long he	3112	B
before he uh just moved to New York City knowing that that's where he had to live to quote unquote make it in the music world	3112	B
and um became a music critic and that probably puts us somewhere around the early sixties uh when he was doing that	3112	B
i've seen that date a good bit on the uh on some of the albums because_1 he would typically uh sign and date everything that	3112	B
	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
my goodness	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
you have one that's nineteen years older	3112	B
my goodness	3112	B
that is a wide spread	3112	B
well we were at the opposite ends there were two sisters in between	3112	B
but uh because he left home so early i think there was one summer i can remember him living at home and i was maybe six years old	3112	B
i mean other than that uh i don't even ever remember living in in the same house with him at all	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
well it was it was thrilling	3112	B
um my mother was with me at the time and it was ironically it was the first time that we'd seen him conduct that particular group which he'd been with so long	3112	B
she had seen him fact she had seen him conduct in Carnegie Hall before	3112	B
um and i'm not sure it was probably the American Symphony Orchestra when Leopold Stokowlski was	3112	B
uh in New York City that was Stokowlski's orchestra and Ainsley was an associate conductor with him for quite a while and it at one point did in fact uh	3112	B
<silence>	3112	B
uh conduct there at Carnegie Hall so she got to see him there and i- i didn't	3112	B
<silence>	3112	A
oh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh that that must have been wonderful were you able to hear	3112	A
yeah sometimes	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
well um actually that lead into a couple different things um my dad worked with unions um	3112	A
for placing so he could really relate to what you were saying but um	3112	A
my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um even as a child i got to go	3112	A
to a lot of different um	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
kinds of musical events	3112	A
um i grew up in Detroit and so we had opportunities for a wide range of things um one of the	3112	A
regrets i have is that i grew up with a house filled with classical music and music that i really loved but i never took the time to	3112	A
find out um who the composers were or it it was just always there and there were certain things that um	3112	A
i liked so much but i still have trouble to this day sometimes i will recognize a passage but i'll have no idea what it's from or whose it is and um over the last few years	3112	A
and when my father lived with us um i made more of an effort to learn but um that's something that i	3112	A
regretted but um when you mentioned the band music my	3112	A
son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school but this was the first year	3112	A
with marching band and i really enjoy band music um it	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh what instrument did you play	3112	A
oh i like that	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
yeah	3112	A
what uh my husband Tim played a trombone in high school and he also played in a a band in college not marching band but	3112	A
symphonic and that was	3112	A
really the first time that i got to hear a lot of the um	3112	A
band music and some of the wonderful composers other than the traditional Sousa and things that everybody knows and	3112	A
so i've	3112	A
enjoyed this so much um with our son now doing that and he plays tuba so i don't don't get to see him when he's doing um	3112	A
	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
yes uh	3112	A
we uh	3112	A
	3112	A
	3112	A
 uh the tuba and the sousaphone don't fit in in every kind of uh car	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
 yes	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh gosh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
God	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
yes	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
well he must have collected that over a period of years	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
hum	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
i was going to ask you and it seemed that there must have been a big gap um i also have a brother who's thirteen years older and one who's nineteen years older you- you don't run into that very often	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
uh-huh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
yeah	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh i'm glad you got to go and hear him in New York though that um that must have been	3112	A
very special	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
oh	3112	A
<silence>	3112	A
 you go ahead and start tell me how you'd you'd organize	3199	A
 okay the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought first of all you needed to	3199	A
kind of about the same time every year like the same week of the the same month	3199	A
and and then you'd have to send out	3199	A
uh you know good flyers and then mail to all that you wanted to attend	3199	A
and of course food and fun are going to be your your	3199	A
ways to get people there um the ones that i've attended	3199	A
some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some of course just have lunch or	3199	A
um also like at Christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion	3199	A
and	3199	A
uh all kinds of events are usually held	3199	A
i've seen talents for mainly the kids that are there and	3199	A
you need probably information about your ancestors to tie that tie you together-	3199	A
	3199	B
<silence>	3199	B
well why don't you start because_1 you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind	3199	B
<silence>	3199	B
	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
well now i i have a question for you do you like uh fresh water fishing or salt water fishing	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
is that right	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
oh you do okay	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
oh where do you fish for striper there	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
okay	3126	B
oh	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
um-hum	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
uh-huh pretty much	3126	B
okay so you're out in a boat then	3126	B
oh	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
i've gone up there camping like at Eisenhower State Park and i've observed fishing but i've never actually fished there	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
so you like to go for striper then	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
	3126	B
well the time i went and watched i went over to the uh to the dam and it was right after	3126	B
one of the major major rains that we'd had uh in fact i think it had been over the spillway recently when we went it was back down but uh some of the roadblocks were still up or there was evidence of them	3126	B
and people were they really had the gates open	3126	B
big time	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
well i couldn't believe some of the striper that these people were pulling out and there were just people galore for that matter just just everywhere just huge fish	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
so to speak	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
all right	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
deep in the channel huh	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
i'll be	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
oh wow	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
right	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
 well i used to fish- go every summer to northern Canada	3126	B
and so i i've been spoiled by that uh but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row	3126	B
of uh sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through two thousand miles	3126	B
and uh we started out fishing out of a lodge and then we started uh either taking our own canoes or renting them	3126	B
when we got there and hitting a few of the	3126	B
you know smaller lakes along the river chain and uh catch Northern Pike and walleye primarily	3126	B
and sometimes Lake Trout also	3126	B
so we'd always go the first week in June you know essentially as soon as school was out and everything is all over and done we'd uh we go uh	3126	B
course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point he'd graduated from college and was in the Army and	3126	B
he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany	3126	B
and so i went with him in the middle of May and much to our surprise when we got there all the lakes were still frozen no yeah the first week we were there we just had to camp and	3126	B
uh we could go on the streams they were open up you know the flowing- where the water was flowing but the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole yeah whole first week we were there	3126	B
but then the next week they were just just like day and night difference we had some rain and wind and it it cleared all the lakes off and uh you know the fishing was already really picking up but uh	3126	B
those were my favorite fishing trips the most serious fishing i guess i've done	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
oh	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
good grief	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
wow	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
right	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
that's incredible	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
boy	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
oh boy	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
well i need to break my kids in they i have a son you know Wesley that enjoys it but he hasn't really caught enough fish to appreciate any fishing so i i'd like to break them in a little bit	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
uh-oh	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
uh-huh	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
right	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
huh	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
what do they use for bait	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
good grief	3126	B
	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
yeah use the little ones for bait yeah why not	3126	B
oh me	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
fourth of July yeah	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
oh me	3126	B
<silence>	3126	B
i haven't really done any of that uh and oddly enough uh Jackie's parents live on the the Carolina- beach in North Carolina and and we've i guess we went out one time	3126	B
and just fished you know from the shore like in the winter you know one Christmas trip	3126	B
but other than that that's really been it yeah they uh i've always wanted to actually go out in the boat i think i went out on a a snapper party boat in the Gulf once upon a time but uh and i was i was too sick to	3126	B
	3126	B
<silence>	3126	A
okay	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i haven't been salt water fishing since i was about ten	3126	A
yeah and i do everything up at Lake Texoma oh yeah i'm a striper fisherman	3126	A
oh everywhere- wherever those little suckers are	3126	A
but uh we camp at the lodge Texoma State Park	3126	A
over on the Oklahoma side and uh but usually when we go striper fishing- when i go out for the big ones we travel down the you know where the channel is down the middle of the lake	3126	A
we usually chase them_1 down through there	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh yeah oh yeah do you ever go up there	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh it's good fishing up there	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
yeah of course i won't- you know i won't throw anything back	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh yeah	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh my gosh that's supposed to be the greatest time to fish	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
yeah	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh yeah	3126	A
oh yeah	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
it's fun- well my dad got me hooked on it	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
and uh yeah oh God pun pun and uh we'd go out he liked to go out about five thirty and you know watch the sun come up every morning and uh boy we	3126	A
we knew a bunch of the striper guides and and so we'd follow them and he had a CB on the boat and all that kind of stuff and we'd just follow the channel and when it's you know	3126	A
middle July through late August when it's so hot they stay down real deep all the big ones do yeah follow that channel on up	3126	A
but uh so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then we usually fish under the bridge at night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that because where we go a lot of times	3126	A
uh the waves are so big i don't want my kids out there because_1 it's sort of dangerous but i love it i love it	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh really	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh how much fun	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh how much fun	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh you're kidding ooh not for me	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh my gosh	3126	A
ooh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
yeah yeah when i take the kids out like i say we in fact Memorial Day weekend we went up to the lake and uh	3126	A
my cousins have a boat my boat is sitting in my driveway not running and uh so we go up there and we decided	3126	A
that we'd you know go out first- we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on let's go fishing we hauled in well we brought in	3126	A
thirty three fish and we had thrown a bunch of little ones back	3126	A
and uh so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun those kids	3126	A
they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones	3126	A
and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but	3126	A
Jamie's getting to the age now that when i get up and go fishing early in the morning he wants to go too you know he doesn't want to get left behind anymore	3126	A
so it's getting a little difficult to do that but	3126	A
we love it we just love it	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
well i have to watch it because Ashley'll out fish her brother half the time and so you know that gets a little sore	3126	A
but where we camp there there's a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk	3126	A
um down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up and they'll go down there while i'm cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they have more fun with that	3126	A
oh usually i'll buy them_1 a thing of worms or a lot of times i'll just give them_1 a piece of bacon and they're taught- they'll tear up bacon and stick it i mean those they'll they'll bite empty hooks that's what's so funny	3126	A
and when we're out chasing the big stripers we use those perch for bait	3126	A
yeah it's great	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
but we just love it up there in fact Jamie wanted to go up this weekend with it being fourth of July weekend but uh i can't put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet i'm still pretty sore	3126	A
so anyway but	3126	A
have you been um salt water fishing	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
right-	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
<silence>	3126	A

since that's my basic thing um	3175	A
i wear a pantsuit most of the time not a pantsuit i guess pants and a shirt	3175	A
and um in the summertime i wear cotton tops cotton top shirts and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters i like sweaters a lot	3175	A
and so i do that but when i go out for meetings	3175	A
 uh then i will wear either uh skirts or um a dress	3175	A
and i have a couple of pantsuits because_1 those are real in at this time but	3175	A
that's basically what i do	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
oh	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
um-hum	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
right	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
well that sounds nice	3175	A
um it said the seasons do do you change much through the season or	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
yeah yeah	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
right	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
then maybe	3175	A
yeah	3175	A
um well i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway and so my note change dramatically over the years if i need something new i will go and buy it	3175	A
but basically i'm a a pretty much the same in the summertime i wear the light cotton and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters	3175	A
and so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either	3175	A
and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i	3175	A
i i enjoy that but it just wouldn't be um	3175	A
smart for me to do that in my home with my children	3175	A
so i have to um	3175	A
think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i don't know if they consider that a job i don't really get paid for that	3175	A
uh often but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike	3175	A
um but it doesn't really change in my clothing style	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
yeah yeah	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
oh	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
oh dear	3175	A
 that's not helpful	3175	A
<silence>	3175	A
yeah i guess so well it's been great talking to you have a great day bye	3175	A
	3175	A
 -hello	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
well i think our tastes are fairly similar- similar although i'm i government worker i do tend to i'm um a scientist	3175	B
so that technically i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes but for the most part i don't i wear fairly respectable looking shoes and	3175	B
and a pantsuit of sort- one sort or another	3175	B
and um	3175	B
i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have some- have visitors or have to give talks	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
right	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
 no actually i guess this summer i i wore some fairly nice jeans um more than i wore- have in previous seasons	3175	B
but um no i tend to to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer	3175	B
i don't know whether they think by	3175	B
	3175	B
right um yeah i don't i don't	3175	B
i you know i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends	3175	B
and i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of of secretaries was you know overdress overkill sort of and	3175	B
in a sense- uh in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries	3175	B
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public	3175	B
it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here	3175	B
you know i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
um-hum um-hum	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
right	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
um-hum um-hum	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
um-hum	3175	B
<silence>	3175	B
exactly i mean you can look businesslike in in a pantsuit- uh the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things	3175	B
yeah i'm i'm really glad about that pantsuits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics	3175	B
and so i used to have a problem when when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash	3175	B
 so	3175	B
 right right but otherwise now i'm i i guess we're both pretty practical	3175	B
okay well have a good day bye-bye	3175	B
	3175	B
	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
uh-huh	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh where would i be i would be somewhere around hm seven or eighth	3176	B
i think for control	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh no um	3176	B
more on the uh higher end	3176	B
yeah	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh well for one i think criminals um	3176	B
they uh i mean i'm all for people you know hunting and doing their thing although i don't hunt personally	3176	B
i don't uh i don't own any guns but um you know i mean i've i've shot gun plenty of guns uh target practice	3176	B
and um well i mean i've kind of gone out hunting a little bit you know with boyfriends but uh	3176	B
 it's it's fun but you really have to have respect for the weapon	3176	B
and uh but the thing i'm concerned about is you know those people you know like a seven day delay is not gonna hurt those people it's no big thing um you know because it's it's	3176	B
you know recreation whereas the people who are going out to um you know for crime	3176	B
you know to rob somebody now i think that's good that they have enough time to check their record you know and it	3176	B
oh yeah it's for everybody's safety	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
uh-huh yeah i mean i could be five too	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh well i didn't think about that	3176	B
yeah	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
um-hum	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
yeah	3176	B
yeah it definitely is i didn't think about the other side huh	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
hm well i served in the service so you have to	3176	B
 you have to uh shoot a weapon and qualify otherwise you don't pass	3176	B
so to speak and uh so we had to zero it you know to your own eye each gun you have to kind of zero to your own eye and how you look at the sights	3176	B
and um	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh well i'm kind of fifty fifty you know if- you know hearing your argument it got- i'm just right smack in the middle	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh well you	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
	3176	B
well you definitely need to you know have the uh respect for it and you can't just pick up a gun and expect to hit something you know you may be within let's say a foot- foot range	3176	B
i mean uh i don't know half a foot to a foot off	3176	B
um just because of your sights and how you look through a sight as compared to somebody else	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh uh that was uh i- i think we just for small but it was quail i think	3176	B
i mean yeah that was just nothing not not anything like deer or rabbits or squirrels	3176	B
but uh	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
um-hum	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
oh well here uh actually about thirty minutes away there was a guy that fired and the bullet actually went through the deer and then hit somebody and killed them_1	3176	B
so it hit two different targets um and	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
i don't know it's i'm surprised because usually when a bullet hits something it um	3176	B
it it compresses you know it loses it's shape	3176	B
but uh evidently they had bone fragments of both so um yeah it killed and and they've had several instance right here in Raleigh and it was national news	3176	B
and it was a real big thing but uh had several uh one woman was out in her backyard and she had a white glove on she was taking her laundry down and the guy thought it was the tail of the uh deer	3176	B
and shot her	3176	B
uh i think so yeah there was two or three killings like right one was a school teacher and of course all the school- kids uh were upset about it and it made the news so uh	3176	B
you know it's it hit pretty close to home i guess	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
	3176	B
<silence>	3176	B
no and-	3176	B
 okay did	3176	A
 um all i the scale is from one to ten i think one being um no	3176	A
or i'm sorry is all- total control	3176	A
and then ten as being no control is that what it was	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
okay_1 so that would be like less control	3176	A
i i'm confused but i don't really think it matters but okay more control okay_1 and why is that	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum i don't either	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
huh	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
gosh i've never done that	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum where it's a like cool down if they're just like in the bad uh-huh i agree um that's why i'm i guess i'm like five	3176	A
in the middle because	3176	A
because like if i like i say if someone tried to break into my house today i would wanna get a gun that day	3176	A
you know for- to help be protected tomorrow or whatever that night	3176	A
but i wouldn't want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says i'm gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so it's like a double-edged sword i guess	3176	A
so	3176	A
hm hm but i've never i don't know if i've ever shot a gun i don't	3176	A
oh you have to that's neat	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
huh	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
who but you wanted like slightly more rules like	3176	A
um like you're towards the conservative end	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum i was just wondering because_1 like since i've never shot one maybe it's different if you've actually shot one or like you said hunted or you know maybe if i you know had ever shot one	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
huh	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
hm what kind of hunting have you done	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
hm	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
hm um-hum	3176	A
hm because_1 like i have friends that hunt and um but they're like real careful they kill the animal with like one shot so they don't have like a injured animal running around and um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
hm	3176	A
oh my God	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or some real super gun or	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
hm	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
oh my gosh	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
hm	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
 oh my God	3176	A
did she die or	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
hm	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
um-hum um-hum	3176	A
hm	3176	A
<silence>	3176	A
gosh i'd uh wouldn't wanna live near a forest	3176	A
uh-huh really are you still in the service or	3176	A
<silence>	3120	B
okay	3120	B
well did you go to college	3120	B
and where did you go	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
uh-huh	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
well i went to the University of Minnesota	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
i am uh-huh where do you live now	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
well i'm in Texas i'm in Austin	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
uh-huh	3120	B
i'm familiar with Plano i visited once or twice	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
oh i love it i love it i really do	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
that's correct i have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
she has her heart set on U T	3120	B
and um you know having gone to the University of Minnesota	3120	B
i know what a big university is like and um	3120	B
one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters	3120	B
is my youngest daughter got involved in band and Baylor has a band camp	3120	B
so she went for a week and it was overnight and they lived in the dorms	3120	B
and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's you know like on a college- a smaller college campus	3120	B
and um my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
so um	3120	B
i i i still think the exposure was good	3120	B
the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know what were your selection criteria did you base it	3120	B
on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know there's all of these	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
areas to look at in making the decision	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
oh wow	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
oh definitely	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
oh how exciting	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
oh that was a that worked out very well for you	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
well then he should come to U T	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
large classes	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
oh i went from a large high school to a university- large university and i definitely felt like i was a number um i mean	3120	B
it is a different feeling but that was that was my only option	3120	B
i i mean i just really couldn't look at anything else that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior- you know a junior college which i didn't want to do	3120	B
so that's how you know my decision was made but um	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
yes	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
what what does he hopes to be a writer	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
huh	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
oh she she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions um	3120	B
what she talks about a lot is theater which i think is okay Bethany let's be real um	3120	B
 she really is is pretty unfocused at this point	3120	B
and i don't know she's taken a lot of French	3120	B
and she may end up doing something with that	3120	B
and i am a single mom so	3120	B
i've been and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married so i'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake	3120	B
and i'm you know showing them if you're strong in math and science {kiddos}	3120	B
this is one area where women can make some decent money	3120	B
you know i mean i'm kind of really putting the practical	3120	B
application you know and and saying yet do something that you enjoy	3120	B
by all means go get that piece of paper you know do you just have one son	3120	B
i see	3120	B
well it sounds like he's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do	3120	B
<silence>	3120	B
<silence>	3120	A
okay	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
yes i did	3120	A
i went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia	3120	A
um it was Sweeper College it was- about seven hundred and fifty students i had	3120	A
gone to a small	3120	A
school growing up uh	3120	A
and a lot of my friends went	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
to university -University of Michigan but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when i graduated and	3120	A
um were looking for a southern school and	3120	A
um also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and	3120	A
um	3120	A
what about you	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
oh so you're from the Midwest too	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
um i live in Texas now where are you	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
oh um my brother's in Austin	3120	A
um he lives in Lakeway he um had moved uh we're in Plano	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
and	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
oh Austin is so pretty i really like it	3120	A
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
is um because you live in Austin is she thinking about the University of Texas	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
oh	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
yes	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
um yeah those um and those were several uh	3120	A
that we did consider um my parents	3120	A
uh um certainly didn't push but	3120	A
wanted me to look in the south and because i had been in a small school	3120	A
they suggested that i probably i when i say small my graduating class had eighteen in it	3120	A
and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one	3120	A
um or small group situations and	3120	A
i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in	3120	A
biology and i also wanted to spend	3120	A
one year studying in Europe um i had had an A F S student	3120	A
from Germany live with us our senior year	3120	A
i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and	3120	A
i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
they also had a strong language department and i'd always loved working with children um	3120	A
and	3120	A
i found that i couldn't	3120	A
fit everything in	3120	A
but because i had had a fair amount of French going in i was able	3120	A
to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that	3120	A
interested me um	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
and so that was some of but	3120	A
several of the things you mentioned were the things that um	3120	A
our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M he's but he thinks he wants to be a writer and i don't think that	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
yes	3120	A
um and really his	3120	A
his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand	3120	A
um	3120	A
and so he's used to a bigger size and because my brother is there	3120	A
uh he would have family close by so there there are advantages um but i also	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to	3120	A
University of Michigan which was so large and they really felt	3120	A
um like they were numbers	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
you still	3120	A
yeah	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
well that's- that's certainly um	3120	A
especially today with the cost of college i mean that is a a major	3120	A
um consideration and i do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools and even though Baylor um	3120	A
and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there	3120	A
who just love it and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and	3120	A
um	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
i do feel like there are a lot of options it's it's	3120	A
but i had been hoping some schools i know give um	3120	A
oh even this year Jay had an aptitude	3120	A
test um	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and	3120	A
we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter	3120	A
know what she'd like to do	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
yeah	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
yes	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
um-hum	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
yes	3120	A
<silence>	3120	A
well he but he has even now that he's in high school um and of course there's there is	3120	A
still time but he's beginning to feel that	3120	A
as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it you know it's the it's	3120	A
well basically uh did you wanna go first then	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
okay right	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
um-hum	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
sure uh-huh	3184	A
yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a small residential area and we're out of the	3184	A
cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and uh it's just a typical um	3184	A
three bedroom type of home it's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know it's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home and um	3184	A
and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um	3184	A
there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's	3184	A
where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of um home so	3184	A
 uh	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
uh-huh oh really hm	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
sure	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
yeah	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
oh yeah yeah	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
yeah	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
um-hum so it's a rambler style	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
um-hum	3184	A
<silence>	3184	A
yeah yeah it's kind of like what ours is uh our one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because_1 they are making	3184	A
	3184	A

	3178	B
<silence>	3178	B

<silence>	3178	B
it's kind of white and then we have a peach border and then there's um	3178	B
there's wall paper on the bottom part	3178	B
so	3178	B
<silence>	3178	B
have you done any	3178	B
<silence>	3178	B
actually it took a long time because_1 we had to rip off the wall paper first and then um	3178	B
wash down the	3178	B
um like there was all the sticky glue stuff on still	3178	B
 just with water	3178	B
yeah but it took a long time to do that	3178	B
and then the painting took a while too so	3178	B
<silence>	3178	B
yeap	3178	B
we did	3178	B
<silence>	3178	B
what's that	3178	B
<silence>	3178	B
	3178	A
so you just got through painting your living room	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
and what color did you paint it	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
uh-huh	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
hm that sounds neat	3178	A
so did y'all have any problems or or you know did it go pretty fast	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
uh-huh how'd you get that off	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
oh really	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
uh-huh	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
uh-huh did all of y'all get in there and get your hands dirty	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
	3178	A
it what is it do you what do you usually paint the inside with enamel or latex or	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
what what	3178	A
<silence>	3178	A
	3191	A
now then i think that are you there all right do you have any one that has been in a nursing home	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
oh	3191	A
yes	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
well what do you think can be done about that i mean what can we do	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
well i can remember of course i'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this	3191	A
we did not have to call on on someone else and i feel	3191	A
	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
yeah	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
certainly did- i worked with an agency in West Texas that	3191	A
they it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels	3191	A
and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen	3191	A
my mother expired just just a little over a year ago and we had finally she didn't wanna live with either my sister or me	3191	A
but we be got found a retirement center for her and it was beautiful and they had all these they didn't even have nursing care there	3191	A
so until as long as mother was you know mobile and got her food- and she was with people with whom she enjoyed	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
sure	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
yes sir	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
yeah	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
being a widow i find that eating alone is one of the hardest things i have to do	3191	A
i have just recently retired and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to	3191	A
so uh mother had the little kitchenette and she could do all these fine things that she just	3191	A
had- had a microwave had to pop her popcorn now this is wonderful but when it came time for a full meal	3191	A
then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy it	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
oh i think so too-	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
well	3191	A
<silence>	3191	A
	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
uh-huh yeah i'm here	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
uh well uh we may um my grandmother before very short time um	3191	B
she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip	3191	B
because she could receive more medical attention but um that physical therapy was there and whatever but i think in visiting her there	3191	B
um it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in uh weren't there mentally uh she was probably the only person in the um	3191	B
whole nursing home that uh still had all of her mental facilities about her so that was uh that was very disheartening	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
oh yeah it's really hard i guess i- i come from a family of um	3191	B
of uh take care of your elders i I guess um my my dad's mother is an invalid and she lives with my aunt and uncle and they care for her you know all around the clock though she's not	3191	B
uh she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed	3191	B
so i guess you know there's that family commitment um i know that my parents my mother's trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can	3191	B
um	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
yeah	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
right yeah	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
yeah well probably i think as long as the person's able to um to understand what's going on around them and i think	3191	B
you know my grandmother right now still able to walk around and she's still able to um	3191	B
to do some things for herself though she gets Meals On Wheels which i think is a great thing because um	3191	B
it saves people from having to prepare her food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever though she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her	3191	B
hum-um	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
uh-huh	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
right	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
um-hum right	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
yeah that i think you know it's really funny i have two grandmothers still alive and my	3191	B
my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible she's like openly told people she's always been very good about knowing yes she's eighty nine and she said that she really would like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home	3191	B
but when the time comes um	3191	B
she and she can't do things and she has to be cared for or whatever she would prefer and she's actually said this to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment	3191	B
uh probably with like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette	3191	B
so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway	3191	B
uh to a room where there's a cafeteria and there's other people there and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
yes	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
right	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
right	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
right	3191	B
<silence>	3191	B
 yeah i think i think that probably until invalids- until they're really invalids elderly- the elderly are invalids	3191	B
i think that they should be able to interact with other people in- in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it i think um and see i know that	3191	B
my grandmother would like to stay in her house and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma actually says who she wants to live with she's pretty you know she lets people know	3191	B
so-	3191	B
 do you have any hobbies	3182	A
what are yours	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
ooh how great	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
oh uh ceramic painting	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
the china more	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
how did you ever get into that that sounds so interesting	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
how marvelous- i	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
now do you do it just for yourself or do you do it to give as gifts or do you actually sell it	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
oh that sounds marvelous- now do you work outside of the home	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
	3182	A
uh don't retire well see i don't i never uh returned to work for the past- i have stayed home for about the last nine years	3182	A
we've transferred around and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake uh on Lake Erie	3182	A
so the lake life appealed to me and my husband's working and he left it up to me if i worked or not	3182	A
so in my spare time i love to sew there aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing	3182	A
but i do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home so i enjoy doing my uh toppers for my window applications	3182	A
and things like that but uh just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
that is excellent	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
we're in the suburb- i'm in the suburb of Cleveland and i'm about um	3182	A
fifteen miles probably from downtown Cleveland something like that and Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie and prior to this we were fifty miles west from here so we were right on the lake	3182	A
and Cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard and you do find people uh into the crafts and the things that uh	3182	A
various things for spare time but i have never heard and i have actually never run into anyone into the china painting and i'm just intrigued with it	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
right where you're getting into the delicate work now do you where- where did you first get your lessons from	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
through a uh an adult ed or uh strictly a china type	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
oh how marvelous	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
oh and it's so nice it must be so nice for you now that you're retired	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
oh isn't that great and you'll probably really uh regain- regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a a class again	3182	A
<silence>	3182	A
	3182	B
yes i do	3182	B
china painting and ceramics	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
i enjoy it um-hum	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
i enjoy the china more	3182	B
and now that i have my eyes corrected to the point that i can see the delicate part of china painting i do enjoy it	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
my husband kept begging me and he's been dead now for twenty years so you understand that this was a long time ago	3182	B
but he finally brought me the china the book the brushes and he said i have made arrangements for your lessons	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
and i said i'll do it for three months and if i don't like it that's it	3182	B
well i painted an awful lot until his death which was several years	3182	B
and it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable	3182	B
self satisfying thing i've had i	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
i have sold quite a bit i give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home and then i just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it um-hum	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
i have just retired	3182	B
yes	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
no it's not it's a great hobby but don't retire oh it's	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
oh have you- well	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
wow	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
oh i see-	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
oh um-hum	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
 well if my sister is the seamstress of the two of us	3182	B
and but she doesn't china paint so we both have our expertise sided	3182	B
um what part of Ohio are you in	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
yep	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
yes	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
well	3182	B
if you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can i mean a large flat plate hm	3182	B
that way you can get the feel of you're not cramped on these smaller objects	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
that's right	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
in Abilene Texas	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
uh she just taught china painting um-hum and	3182	B
and when then we had so much fun there i had a friend from Albany which is about thirty six miles away	3182	B
and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home because she did our firing for us	3182	B
and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies and it was just such a delightful time	3182	B
and then after i beg pardon	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had to go to work after my husband's death	3182	B
so i have put it aside for a little while but i'm i have just found me an instructor to get started again um-hum	3182	B
<silence>	3182	B
oh i know	3182	B
of course i just have one beautiful peonies- with peonies uh umbrella stand and i have two daughters and they're both	3182	B
<silence>	3159	B
i don't uh subscribe to any magazines at home because we get so many at work that um i need to read that um i just don't take any at home	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
uh-huh	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
	3159	B
right	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
right i used- i used to take McCalls and Good Housekeeping and um several magazines like that a few years ago at at at home	3159	B
but yeah the subscriptions ran out and i never renewed them and i found that i really didn't have time at home since i work to read them	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
uh-huh	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
right	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
right uh-huh when i- when i had my magazines at home i would find that i kind of skim through them_1 and look at the pictures you know and if something caught my eye then i might read something but otherwise than that you know they were um	3159	B
	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
um-hum that's right that's right	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
right	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
uh-huh	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
right well since i work with computers	3159	B
during my work i have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything and i have to read the magazines you know such as Byte and Computer World and Mac World and all these	3159	B
um magazines such as that so i really	3159	B
you know just	3159	B
 i can see that it will be a very long time probably before i subscribe to any magazines at home	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
right	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
 that's right	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum right if i if i go on an airplane ride or something i'll stop in and pick up a you know a Cosmopolitan or something to read on the airplane but um you know that's basically just about	3159	B
 i buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
 right	3159	B
<silence>	3159	B
okay	3159	B
it was nice to talk with you too	3159	B
thank you bye-bye	3159	B
	3159	B
	3159	A
okay do you subscribe to magazines yourself	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
oh i see i get uh McCalls of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest	3159	A
and then once in a while i'll pick up a Working Woman or something and realize why i don't want to reenter- go back to work what i enjoy about staying home and uh i read magazines mainly because they're fast	3159	A
and if i wanna relax while i watch TV of course i'm one of those that does two things at once	3159	A
and uh i read Good Housekeeping and Better Homes and McCalls and i like them_1 because they're kind of short and to the subject	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
uh-huh and then you stopped them_1 all	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
i find that um about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular and then i kind of get turned off by it other than Good Housekeeping Good Housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for when um	3159	A
when i'm really have time and really wanna read something you know and i don't get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with uh on a general basis and	3159	A
we travel a lot so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various uh you know different ones	3159	A
and i get into uh newspapers so that- i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am i'm uh read- read it fast and put it down	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
right	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
well	3159	A
	3159	A
but uh that's mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this i	3159	A
i subscribe like i said to a few and once in a while i buy that new magazine called First on the newsstands or something like that but i kind of stay with my own subject matter of what	3159	A
uh pertains to my daily life at the present time	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
right uh well sometimes if you know if you're in transportation in public transportation i know that people'll read them_1 on something like that	3159	A
	3159	A
i do that when we travel i always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we no matter what it is air travel or anything and i	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
right although- although now	3159	A
<silence>	3159	A
	3159	A
uh reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it and it was just above my head without having someone there to	3159	A
give me the advice as i went along it was you know kind of a little bit more than what i needed so i never did get into them i	3159	A
when i bought the computer all of a sudden i was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail i think they all said thought well we have a live one she'll subscribe but they were wrong i never got into them but uh okay	3159	A
all right i guess we might as well end our conversation at this point it was nice talking with you okay um-hum bye now	3159	A
	3159	A
<silence>	3110	B
	3110	B
um a little bit during the school year we're um	3110	B
definitely expected to wear hosiery and you know things like that although we can wear slacks	3110	B
um during during the school year and of course that's a good idea because	3110	B
i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and	3110	B
you know so it's pretty important to um i also like very much the new split skirts	3110	B
you know because then you've	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
oh that's oh that's true the old culottes that's right but those are just real comfortable and um	3110	B
you know allow you the privacy and all	3110	B
	3110	B
the only	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
uh no i think it needs to be longer probably if it's split it it varies though between the principal- from one principal to another	3110	B
there are some like	3110	B
um some principals insist that you not wear um anklet type shorts	3110	B
i mean socks	3110	B
um that you have to wear hose- you know hose but i know of other schools	3110	B
where they wear um you know anklets and	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
 how embarrassing i know i hate that you really have to check on the	3110	B
	3110	B
check on the length well we wear the knee high ones a lot too so	3110	B

and i i mean i still have some sweaters that i had you know from before i moved down here things that were were wool or just you know really nice things and	3110	B
and really very seldom get to wear them and should certainly get rid of probably all of them	3110	B
but like i said i'm kind of a	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
	3110	B
at the beginning of the winter	3110	B
	3110	B
 now that is silly isn't it	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
yeah	3110	B

<silence>	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
well the thing is that you know it it does get cold but it's just such a short season you know and you just	3110	B
can't wear that much	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
oh how nice	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B

<silence>	3110	B
um but they carry them_1 at Dillard's	3110	B
hum i'll have to look at those that sounds interesting	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
um-hum um-hum well you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and i i really do too i just i don't know i'm really comfortable in	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
um-hum i like that too	3110	B
that's real good very well	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
	3110	B
that's exactly right	3110	B
oh well	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
for work	3110	B
well you you work year round right yeah	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
 um-hum	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
um-hum that's true	3110	B
yeah that's true well i have more summer stuff i guess	3110	B
for that kind of casual because_1	3110	B
we do go on a um	3110	B
i go back to Illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husband's	3110	B
mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there so	3110	B
uh in fact i was thinking this summer that since i'm doing summer school i haven't	3110	B
worn hardly- very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them_1 all together so	3110	B
to take them_1 on our trip	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
oh how nice	3110	B
	3110	B
well i took i went through my closet this spring and i	3110	B
i took some stuff out	3110	B
and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because i'm so tired of looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight	3110	B
 but it isn't so much too tight i mean i could easily well maybe not too easily but i could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and you know and there are things that i really don't want to get rid of you know i really want	3110	B
to keep them because they're nice and so i thought well i'll put them_1 in there and then maybe i'll feel so bad that i can't wear them now	3110	B
	3110	B
but so far	3110	B
	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
	3110	B
oh that's funny	3110	B
yeah that's right hey when you have kids you definitely have to have	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
 oh	3110	B
you think they're hinting	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
yeah that's right	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
ooh yeah you'll be glad believe me oh because_1	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
um	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
oh	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
it's just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is	3110	B
um is when the kids get	3110	B
old enough that they really care what they're wearing	3110	B
my kids are twelve and fifteen	3110	B
	3110	B
on the other hand they can be pretty picky and you know	3110	B
i mean i could get away with	3110	B
you know with	3110	B
it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because	3110	B
they didn't care	3110	B
anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of	3110	B
certain kind of jeans and the the shoes are just about the worst	3110	B
uh	3110	B
gee um my son just came out the other day and he's his	3110	B
what is it i think they're Reebok	3110	B
whatever my other son has Nike Airs at the moment but these Reeboks	3110	B
	3110	B
and i was thinking he bought them in March	3110	B
it was early March he bought them and they are demolished	3110	B
i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them	3110	B
the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean that's how worn out they are	3110	B
and they cost- i bought them on a wonderful sale at Mervyn's they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars	3110	B
on that much of a sale	3110	B
and my husband and i were just talking you know it's	3110	B
i mean we're talking minimum of three of those a year	3110	B
that's a hundred and eighty dollars a year for his tennis shoes	3110	B
you know and my husband	3110	B
 oh it's just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of of really good you know work leather nice	3110	B
men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes he said	3110	B
but i'll be- still be wearing them in ten years	3110	B
	3110	B
so anyway	3110	B
before we go visit grandma	3110	B
	3110	B
<silence>	3110	B
okay so uh during the summertime do you dress differently than than you would when school's going on	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
oh really	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
but those aren't that new i mean i have some that were way old yeah	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
yeah they're very nice do you can you get away with wearing the shorter ones style the ones that really look like shorts kind of	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses i when i dress to go to work my dresses are pretty long and um	3110	A
i couldn't find any hose one day but i found some knee highs so i put those on and the wind caught my skirt and he said what have you got on	3110	A
 yeah it was real funny	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah it's pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so	3110	A
the one day that i did it and i got caught	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
um no i really don't my don't- i work for a computer company but it's not uh real visual i mean it's not like an IBM where you have to wear your blue suit	3110	A
but um i can get away with wearing dresses a lot which i really enjoy	3110	A
because especially i mean you know it's nice sometimes in in a suit because if you're hot inside or cold or you know whatever you have your jacket but uh i'm more comfortable in a dress	3110	A
so but	3110	A
the best thing are you from Texas	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh well you qualify	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh well see that's what's so funny because_1 so many girls move down here from the north and they have these heavy wool suits and it's like God what do i do with that	3110	A
 i said well that's the best part about Texas you can buy uh one dress that you can wear pretty much all through unless like it's the like- two cold months and winter- in December	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
um-hum	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah but you'd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
 really hum	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
well that's really weird because_1 last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so	3110	A
well yeah Oklahoma and Texas so i mean Oklahoma did get colder in the winter but um i guess i just didn't notice it because_1 i never really dressed very warm so	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well and i found a new dressmaker so that i just am crazy about the style of the dresses so	3110	A
i've been yeah i mean i go into every store and i i go do you have Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like i'm strange but	3110	A
it's called Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit and they are the neatest dresses they just are very flattering to your figure and um	3110	A
um i've been fortunate i've found them in in a catalog and then they're a lot cheaper than you can find them_1 at Dillard's	3110	A
so um	3110	A
yeah they do have them_1 at Dillard's and	3110	A
yeah i really enjoy them_1 i've gotten- i've and it's real funny too because i've had a lot of compliments on them_1 when i wear them so	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
well i'm short and i've been told that if you wear the longer skirt it gives you it- it gives you more of an elongated look	3110	A
so um i've always been more comfortable in the longer ones	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
so	3110	A
but anyway but i don't have any play clothes because_1 i spend all my money on clothes that i wear to work	3110	A
so on the weekends and	3110	A
yeah but it's just kind of frustrating because_1 on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes	3110	A
so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend	3110	A
put them_1 with my shorts or something	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
um	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah well i've lost weight recently so i'm now getting to dig out the things that i haven't worn for a while so that's kind of fun	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
yeah well that's something my husband says what are we going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of those because_1 i i have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and it's like what are we going to do	3110	A
said well we'll have to get a bigger house	3110	A
	3110	A
oh i know and then plus- well my sisters have had their children and so now they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me	3110	A
and i'm like well what am i going to do with all this stuff	3110	A
i don't think it will fit my dog	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because_1 then i've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a boy and a girl	3110	A
so that worked out yeah	3110	A
sure i will be because_1 God- i was i was in Foley's the other day and i turned the wrong direction and i ended up in the little kids' clothes and i just picked up something for my niece and it was just it was like thirty bucks i thought golly	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh yeah i can imagine	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
um-hum	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah definitely	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh God yeah i can imagine	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
wow	3110	A
on sale	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
maybe i won't have kids	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
wow	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
<silence>	3110	A
oh no	3110	A
i just can't imagine	3110	A
yeah really well my mother had three girls but i don't remember being that picky about my clothes-	3110	A
	3123	A
okay what do you think about the school systems	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
right	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
okay	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
what do you see as being a problem with the school system	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
oh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
yeah	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
well i don't have children in school and it's been so long since i was in school myself i'm not really sure how to answer that	3123	A
when uh i don't know it seems that they're you know that that the difference is between each school i think if it was	3123	A
if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing	3123	A
uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is	3123	A
you know you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a if if it's the the teacher that's got the problem or if it's the book that's got the problem you know what the materials that they're using and everything	3123	A
that could be causing a problem	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
what kind of school is that	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
oh okay	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
yeah i think that's kind of a good idea because	3123	A
you know it doesn't it doesn't	3123	A
it doesn't divide people by	3123	A
by anything besides what they're interests are	3123	A
and it's a much- higher- it's a learning environment if you're group- if you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are interested in sciences	3123	A
it seems like it would it would uh it would help	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
yeah	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
okay	3123	A
what do you think about about sports in high school and about uh the competitiveness	3123	A
i've i've know i've seen in Plano that there's a lot of really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high schools	3123	A
and do you think that's healthy	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
yeah	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
oh yeah	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
oh okay	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
now i didn't even realize that at all	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
um	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
right	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
huh	3123	A
well i know they've got a lot of elementary schools	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
well now what is Shepton going to be	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
okay	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
okay	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
um	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
yeah that does seem kind of different	3123	A
<silence>	3123	A
	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
uh well	3123	B
where i live in Plano one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their school system	3123	B
and uh in fact i think that there's some areas of of Dallas and Richardson that are in the those city- town city limits but they uh	3123	B
all of the the housing developments adjoining Plano are in the Plano school district and they use that as one of the things that they	3123	B
uh you know that they try to market when they sell homes in that area the fact that it is in Plano schools	3123	B
uh i do have children in that school system uh	3123	B
and have been personally pleased with that uh i'm not sure that it's that that there's that much glory in the Plano schools versus say Richardson and some of the other areas	3123	B
uh	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
uh	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
probably the biggest controversy within our school system	3123	B
is the use of the open classroom concept	3123	B
uh where uh	3123	B
all uh all the students at a given grade level are in one large area for much of the day uh segregated you know by teacher but not necessarily having walls between the classrooms	3123	B
uh i've now had two children that are have been in the system- in the system	3123	B
uh one who seemed to do just fine in that tap type of atmosphere the other i'm not so sure about because of uh his attention span i think he's a little bit more easily distracted than was she	3123	B
and that seems to be the primary complaint uh	3123	B
i think my biggest complaint- problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their classroom to eat	3123	B
uh rather than giving them a a break from that area during the day	3123	B
uh and	3123	B
uh	3123	B
that's i guess i'm a fairly satisfied uh parent as far as the school system goes myself uh	3123	B
that	3123	B
that it really boils down to the quality of the teachers	3123	B
uh and their interest uh in the students individually is going to make the difference versus you know physical things such as the open classroom versus a more closed classroom	3123	B
uh what do you see as problems	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
yeah	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
right	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
uh-huh	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
right	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
now in in Dallas i know at least at some of the later grade levels they have these magnet schools that i think were initially set up to address the segregation issues	3123	B
uh and i wondered uh what the real overall effect on education is of those uh i know i have a niece in the Dallas system that	3123	B
is a uh was just elected to go or selected whatever i i think you have to apply and be accepted to these magnet schools but she's interested in the arts and in in particular in dance	3123	B
uh they call it a magnet school where it attracts kids of certain interest	3123	B
and uh she will be attending i think Skyline Arts Magnet uh or arts and	3123	B
something magnet school uh next year when she enters high school	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
yeah	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
uh-huh	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
now i would think that would would be a good point as well	3123	B
they they don't have that type of thing in Plano they just have these two gargantuan high schools	3123	B
uh but i do think they do provide some type of special interest focus i think the later years uh for for students	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
well	3123	B
oh not really uh i've not been that aware of it	3123	B
uh i live on it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano with Central Expressway down the middle	3123	B
uh and i am on the west side but just barely on the west side i guess my kids are younger than that	3123	B
and in they're in the non competitive uh just athletics uh organizations you know your typical soccer and baseball and all that sort of stuff	3123	B
and because of where we live uh the teams that my son has been on has have been from both sides of the fence if you will	3123	B
they've drawn from both sides and i really haven't sensed any of that yet i it may become more obvious to me in later on	3123	B
i think the one of the more interesting things in Plano is that they have high schools and senior high schools	3123	B
which a lot of people don't realize that	3123	B
that ninth and tenth grade go to high schools of which there there are quite a few in Plano and the senior high schools are only the eleventh and twelfth grade	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
yeah that's was very different uh they have middle school sixth seventh and eighth	3123	B
and then they'll have uh fact they have a couple of huge schools that are actually almost all	3123	B
middle school and elementary school all of those grades in one building	3123	B
but uh	3123	B
for the most part	3123	B
yeah bunch of elementary and they typically feed certain middle schools for sixth seventh and eighth and then there a number at least i could probably think of six	3123	B
high schools	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
Shepton is a high school	3123	B
ninth and tenth	3123	B
and uh there's Shepton and Vines and Wilson or Williams and there's Clark and	3123	B
i don't know whether there's more than four i want to say that there are more than just four but uh it's just ninth and tenth grade and then the the two senior high schools are just eleventh and twelfth graders	3123	B
which is a sort of a different concept	3123	B
<silence>	3123	B
and they're they're just so big i'm a little bothered by that uh just the sheer-	3123	B
	3190	A
where have you been on a wonderful vacation	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
oh that's where we go home too	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
that's where we go	3190	A
 yes my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maizeland yes	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
ah	3190	A
oh we've been there we haven't skied at Broadmoor we went there last year at Christmas time and it was twenty seven below so we had to cancel our ski lessons	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
really	3190	A
oh just this year	3190	A
oh my	3190	A
ah	3190	A
so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
uh-huh	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
no	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
uh-huh	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
yes	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
oh	3190	A
well we went on a family cruise last year on the Premier Family Cruise Line and then we went to Disney it was all part of the package	3190	A
and on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck and it was really oriented toward little kids	3190	A
so the kids could eat with Chip and Dale you know and you know it's just a lot of fun	3190	A
so then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
yes that was the way to travel	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
yes	3190	A
yes that's right that's right and kids are really cheaper too	3190	A
we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available	3190	A
and we left a day early and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites	3190	A
so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin	3190	A
 yeah	3190	A
so then our cruise was actually extended a day and our Disney was extended a day so we turned a seven day trip into ten	3190	A
and they paid for everything	3190	A
yes	3190	A
so that was a wonderful vacation	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
yes	3190	A
well what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
yes	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
yeah	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
oh	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
uh-huh	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
right that would be	3190	A
yes	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
i know i think one of the places i always hit in Colorado is that current outlet store	3190	A
that's what	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
oh with the Santa Claus on the cover yes i've already ordered from that one but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year so	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
Texas	3190	A
yes i'm in the Dallas area	3190	A
in Plano	3190	A
uh so that's not too far	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
oh	3190	A
yes	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
well it was when we left last year we left on the eighteenth right before that big snow storm hit Colorado and we pulled in just as it hit	3190	A
so how do you go do you go up through the Raton Pass	3190	A
when you go up there	3190	A
do you-	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
that's on like Route 287 or something like that	3190	A
<silence>	3190	A
okay	3190	A
okay we uh went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U-Haul trailer because we had to take our dog in the car there was no room for luggage so we went all interstate we went up	3190	A
um through Oklahoma City	3190	A
and then up through uh Kansas and then turned left and went in on I-70	3190	A
and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour it was a little more mile wise	3190	A
but because you could go sixty five miles an hour on the	3190	A
	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
 well normally when we go on vacation we go home to Colorado	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
really yeah Colorado Springs is where we're from	3190	B
 how funny	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
really we live up up uh Lake in the Broadmoor area	3190	B
where my family- my in-laws are	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
oh	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
uh-huh as you can't even ski there anymore	3190	B
yeah they closed it down	3190	B
uh-huh they don't have enough money to keep it going it doesn't doesn't pay so	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
	3190	B
oh uh i'd like to go on vacation i can't- my husband and i wanna go to Florida to go to Disney World but we have two little ones that are under two right now so we wanna wait until they're a little bit older to do that and uh	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
oh	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
well how fun	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
oh yeah oh i bet	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
wow well that sounds pretty neat	3190	B
yeah that sounds pretty good and it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
really	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
wow	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
oh what a deal	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B

well that's great oh	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
oh well we like to ski of course so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends because_1 we moved to Texas about two years ago	3190	B
so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do so we don't we don't get a lot of time to just vacation we did um last year though go to San Antonio for Memorial Day	3190	B
which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing	3190	B
uh but	3190	B
you know other other than that with with both my kids being under two it's real hard to do any any kind of	3190	B
events that that uh don't require babysitting	3190	B
<silence>	3190	B
yeah that's funny you should- funny you should mention that i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it	3190	B

<silence>	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
oh that's wonderful oh	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
now how many how many people are in his immediate family	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
oh wow	3189	B
wow it really is and you get together once a year wow uh	3189	B
are they all here in the area or are they scattered	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3189	B
oh wow that's wonderful that's wonderful	3189	B
well we don't really get together i i would love to and that's why i checked that i wanted to do that because_1 i would love to plan a family reunion sometime um i have a sister in Colorado and	3189	B
uh a sister in upstate New York and a sister in Connecticut and here i am in Texas so we're kind of scattered right now	3189	B
and um my my cousins have a you know they put on a family reunion um once a year but it's always like the second week in September so it's the kids are already back in school	3189	B
and so and that's back in and that's in New York and there's no way i mean there's just no possible way and it's not really a weekend it's just like a day kind of thing because_1 most of them are still- you know um	3189	B
my family moved to Connecticut the rest of the family stayed in New York and uh on Long Island and so they're all kind of local and close and so they just have a you know a day picnic	3189	B
and uh i've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing	3189	B
that would be so wonderful	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
oh wow	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
yeah yeah yeah	3189	B
and do they they have a hotel or where do you stay	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
take everybody yeah	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
yeah yeah oh that sounds so wonderful isn't that nice	3189	B
yeah	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
from one brother and sister from each family	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
oh wow uh-huh	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
um-hum	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
oh i see uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh wow	3189	B
<silence>	3189	B
	3189	A
yes just this last summer we went back to Utah and we met it was my we usually go to my family reunion but this one was my husband's	3189	A
and they're usually quite similar i think	3189	A
no he's from here	3189	A
but um most of his people are from Oregon so we kind of met halfway	3189	A
and so this was one and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and and had you know things like that have to be planned like they had planned that	3189	A
we went to the reunion in end of July- June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend but we had to plan everything like clear in December January to reserve that	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
um-hum	3189	A
no this was everybody	3189	A
oh i oh uh jeez i think over um three hundred were there it was quite a large	3189	A
it was a great big lodge and so we had plenty of room and everything and and some of them live in that area so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave but um	3189	A
that was a great big thing and we do that with his family about every	3189	A
five years a great big one and then like immediate family we do like uh we try to do one thing once a year	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
well he has eight brothers and sisters so that's big by itself	3189	A
yeah so we have a little shindig with them	3189	A
uh they're close in a close proximity um	3189	A
uh let's see there are four of them who live here in Texas and his mom and dad	3189	A
so um the others live in close neighboring um states like Nevada Arizona i think like that and	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
yeah so it's been fun how about_1 you	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
um-hum	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
um-hum that's hard	3189	A
yeah yeah	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
um-hum	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
yeah	3189	A
 it really is fun and my mom's family does it once a year just like you said once a year um they have a a	3189	A
a Wednesday through a a Saturday type thing you can come and go as you please type thing and they do that once a year i kind of missed it	3189	A
this year and felt bad but you can't go every year you just cannot do that um	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
um basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters there are enough in the area to	3189	A
to just kind of span yourself out um whoever's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them like i go stay with my mother and	3189	A
my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad you know kind of thing and so it's not hard	3189	A
in in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area so that's not hard but	3189	A
the real planning that's the real key and they send out my mom's family now this is the first reunion with my husband's family i've really been involved with	3189	A
but my mom's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year and that's how they divide it up and then	3189	A
<silence>	3189	A
uh she has ten in that family and each one of them take their turn and then the the parent whose turn it is the child whose	3189	A
turn it is her children help her like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing yeah and um the thing is that um	3189	A
the the real part is there are two mailings that go out and the first one is to just kind of give a an approximate date and time so you can start getting	3189	A
	3105	A
do you have any personal feelings on on uh the subject	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
um-hum um-hum	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
so outrageous i know i know	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
well i i guess my concern is what we're reading especially in Texas right now with them letting out	3105	A
the people out of jail as soon as they're out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out they're back in crime and- and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriffs	3105	A
deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem with that	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
i think so	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
well	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
doesn't have the right	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right right and meanwhile the witnesses move and die and and- and- and and they and there's no one to face them_1	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right right well they can't get any if the judge is going to have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
it's it's really bad it uh i	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3105	A
a a time limit too don't let it drag on for fifteen years	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
uh do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the result this should be consequences of is capital punishment or or are are there some murders that committed that you think that- leniency should be shown	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
um-hum um-hum	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
okay	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
um-hum	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
hm and and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are because they have had them they have had them killed when they've	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
um um um	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
oh	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
that was their goal oh	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
that would be premeditated	3105	A
	3105	A
uh	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
they killed him	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
um um um	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
um-hum	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
uh-huh	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
no well that's right there's no reason for murder no- i don't care if you're poor or if you're rich or if you're ugly or if you're prejudice- or uh what there that that's just beyond the	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
i think this giving excuses is pretty prevalent uh uh you- i work in the school district and the all these kids they've they've got an excuse for everything and i can see it continuing on when they're adults	3105	A
i just	3105	A
 it's just a a a bad habit uh uh kids have got to learn from the time they're real little there's no excuse for for being bad or making bad choices deliberately or anything it's	3105	A
it's it's uh i- i i sometimes think if if i were on a jury and and had to make the decision could i and i like to think i could if like you if if especially- especially- especially violent	3105	A
crime where it's a serial type killer or where maybe a a child- a child has been deliberately killed or	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
right	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
uh-huh	3105	A
<silence>	3105	A
	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
well uh capital punishment's a hard thing but uh there've been several	3105	B
there've been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to	3105	B
to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people	3105	B
there have been some things you know i mean there's things done that are just	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
yeah that i i don't know how	3105	B
i don't really think there's any other way to deal with it	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
yeah i think that that that that's a really	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
yeah if it's a it's a it presents a clear and present danger i mean it	3105	B
 but it's something that's really hard to deal with the way that our justice system is right now	3105	B
is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal they're the ones with the rights	3105	B
they have the right to uh you know i think i watched something last week um	3105	B
 that evict uh i'm sorry the accused has the right to a speedy trial	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
but the victim does not have the right doesn't have the same	3105	B
doesn't have the same the same uh emphasis on those things as far as they're concerned so now the accused can can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them_1 you know	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
exactly- uh-huh uh-huh exactly a continuance- continuance	3105	B
they can get continuances on for years before a a thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more	3105	B
the	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
yeah that too	3105	B
um	3105	B
i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone	3105	B
has gone through	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
you know a trial- a trial i don't know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there	3105	B
there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
has- uh yeah when someone has- well even when someone has been convicted	3105	B
and i mean	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
it's just so	3105	B
so abundantly clear that they did it	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
that appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times	3105	B
to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that it's such a waste of time and energy and money	3105	B
and it just that's what keeps that's what's keeping all the the you know the the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
oh	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
well i guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that um	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
you know like i could- i could see	3105	B
uh a first time offender being you know maybe in in a in a robbery situation trying to hold up a a store and getting scared and you know firing a gun and accidently	3105	B
killing someone okay i could see that that might be a situation where uh the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and i'm talking about uh	3105	B
cutting people up	3105	B
you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever	3105	B
that those kinds of things and any any kind of violent assault rape included	3105	B
needs to be addressed in in in that context	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty	3105	B
and the thing that was the worst about it is that these	3105	B
that uh two of these individuals were uh well all of the individuals involved were very young	3105	B
one was technically a minor and so he was sent back to Mexico he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here and they had told their teachers that	3105	B
that i mean repeatedly uh during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to to graduate from high school and kill cops	3105	B
that was what they had told their teachers and so that's what they did and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely	3105	B
he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they	3105	B
uh	3105	B
 several several things happened that night but they they beat him up and took his gun and shot him	3105	B
with it and it was	3105	B
it was really terrible i mean	3105	B
uh i'd seen him like three or four days before that	3105	B
we'd we've gone out uh	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
with with he and his wife and that was really really disturbing	3105	B
you know that that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobody's that disadvantaged	3105	B
and there's just no reason- i mean	3105	B
no	3105	B
	3105	B
yeah i think so too and that's uh	3105	B
so i i do- i do feel strongly about	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
yeah	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
yeah	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
um-hum	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decisions and still the people nothing ever happens to them	3105	B
<silence>	3105	B
you know they stay in jail they get off time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again	3105	B

<silence>	3102	A
advice for people taking for parents uh help their their kids through college	3102	A
no i just graduated from college yes	3102	A
i went to Clarion	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my brother- older brother likewise	3102	A
and uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did so i think i would not push them towards any one place	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
yeah exactly	3102	A
i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school that's good for that	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could	3102	A
uh	3102	A
pardon me	3102	A
yeah i lived up at school yeah	3102	A
uh another reason was uh i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically you know	3102	A
you know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself	3102	A
but uh then again i was there for school so	3102	A
uh	3102	A
and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind	3102	A
and i knew that Clarion was known you know for two things actually for their they are known as a teacher's school	3102	A
and also for their business so that's what i ended up going for is for business uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
no no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here	3102	A
uh Maryland uh-huh	3102	A
my fiancee is down there	3102	A
	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
yeah he works for the government	3102	A
yeah	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
exactly	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
exactly yeah	3102	A
it does have a lot of bearing on it whether you're paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted	3102	A
i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know	3102	A
uh they pretty much got to the point well well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up it's your fault it's not ours you know	3102	A
and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either	3102	A
but uh you know i	3102	A
i- i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it was- i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
yeah	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
oh wow that's really good	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know	3102	A
so i went and i just took business well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year	3102	A
and i am going into my third year and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore right	3102	A
and i thought oh my God i am paying for this myself i am not switching completely because i will put myself a year behind so i switched to finance and i liked it better	3102	A
and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year	3102	A
but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
exactly	3102	A
i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted	3102	A
but uh i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they're more focused	3102	A
they know exactly what they want to do	3102	A
<silence>	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
so uh let's see what- what was the topic i forgot oh oh we are supposed to talk	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah do you have any children	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
oh did you where did you go	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
Clarion	3102	B
huh uh	3102	B
would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah i know i- i kind of feel the same way i i just finished college a couple years ago and i uh	3102	B
you know it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but uh you know i went to a college that was fairly local and i feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it i think	3102	B
but you know i know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever	3102	B
i do not know i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something i do not know but	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
but	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
is that why you picked the school you did or	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
so you lived there at school then	3102	B
you lived there at school	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh and that was for tuition and	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
for business	3102	B
so uh are you working somewhere then or	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
oh i see where are you going to move to	3102	B
oh are you do you have friends there or	3102	B
oh i see	3102	B
so does he uh work for a company down there	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
oh i see oh the big company	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
so yeah i i've been working for TI for about twelve years i guess so	3102	B
	3102	B
but uh i'm not originally i'm originally from Illinois	3102	B
but you know i have gone to college i guess a few different places but i think you know most- for the most part	3102	B
you know the teachers have been pretty good and i've got out of it what i've what i put into it	3102	B
so	3102	B
but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but i think you know	3102	B
financially i'm there's only so much i can do for them_1 and i'll say you know here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but	3102	B
otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you	3102	B
but uh	3102	B
i do not know you know the financial end of it like you said i- i put my wife through school too of course TI paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but still was a challenge to do	3102	B
and uh	3102	B
so i think you know financially that's that's one of the big aspects	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
you know you	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah well did you uh since you were paid for school yourself did you- do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah well see i think	3102	B
you know i've known a lot of people that would go to school and and their parents paid for it and i- i guess it depends on the way you were raised too but if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation	3102	B
you know i that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they weren't they didn't take it very serious i know i took it real serious because_1 i didn't start to college until you know	3102	B
	3102	B
i was about eight or ten years and uh you know out of what i should have been in school	3102	B
but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six	3102	B
yeah so i you know and that was hard cause i- i had two kids and you know a family and everything else so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time but	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah you are right exactly	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
right well my- my wife was sort of in the same situation she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for	3102	B
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it	3102	B
but you know by then she had practically got her degree so so you know	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
<silence>	3102	B
yeah i think i think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man i really need this	3102	B
	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
well mostly um a a little fresh water fish but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because i used to live in Utah	3166	B
but um down here i haven't fished much in Texas	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
oh they're really not i think they're good to eat	3166	B
 oh just usually worms nightcrawlers sometimes fish eggs sometimes yeah	3166	B
just little just little fish eggs and um there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook and it will stay relatively well	3166	B
yeah and and they really like that	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
now i have never caught catfish	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
oh is that right	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
um now in Amarillo did you fish anytime	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
um	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
uh-huh right	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
oh how about_1 that	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
oh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
oh i think that is really interesting	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
um-hum	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
i think the	3166	B
see and i wish i could go fishing here because i don't really know much about the fishing here i guess it would if you did it like you were just um saying	3166	B
that's pretty much like rainbow trout you bait the hook you throw it in	3166	B
you troll it a little bit and then you wait and then you troll it a little bit	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
no i don't	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
yeah	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
oh uh-huh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
huh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
you are now i've never used those that's really interesting	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
yeah yeah	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
um what kind of fish do you like the best to eat	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
oh do you	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
um	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
yes i've done fishing like that but but uh tell me what um	3166	B
 where you'd catch crappie my my neighbor has gone before and and done that but	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
um oh oh i know uh they're sort of like well i want to say flies but not exactly like the	3166	B
yeah	3166	B
the yellow ones	3166	B
okay	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
<silence>	3166	B
yeah my mom she just loves to fish and she has a lot of those those little um	3166	B
they almost look neon you know they're just real colored colorful things on her onto her ends yeah and she does- she's really a good fisherwoman	3166	B
yeah	3166	B
well you sound like you're a good fisherwoman too	3166	B
 okay what kind of fishing do you do	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
that's one of the few things i've ever fished for is rainbow trout	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
what what kind of bait do you use to catch them_1	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
oh really fish eggs	3166	A
oh i didn't know that huh	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
oh i didn't know that's a great way	3166	A
i think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish also	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
oh look catfish uh personally i like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best	3166	A
but a catfish a catfish will really just tear into anything like that like liver or uh cheese or anything that smells terrible	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
um no actually i always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma and they have the uh Lake Texoma right next to them_1	3166	A
so the we used to catch some uh sand bass off Lake let's see- there's a Roosevelt Bridge and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom	3166	A
and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be sitting at different levels	3166	A
so yeah you just leave it at that level and in no time something would hit it and you could pull them_1 up two and three times in a row but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom	3166	A
and if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish	3166	A
 and of course depending on how big your bait was um you know would be depending on what you caught	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
yeah that was a lot of fun my grandfather used to do that and we used to have a light at the top of the water	3166	A
he really spoiled me in that respect	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
um-hum	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
yeah well if you do you have any friends with ponds	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
i um well if you can find- well oh even a lake if uh seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they wanna do is throw it out just as far as they can	3166	A
and uh bring it in to you but it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat you you wanna let- make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm	3166	A
and just have it come into the water like a a regular animal or or fish uh well you know something coming off from the bank like they usually do so you don't have to really get uh fish from a boat you know because they're actually right there at the shore	3166	A
	3166	A
yeah it just uh just a slow reel and then let it sit on the bottom but the key is to always have your line tight	3166	A
and that way you can feel when they're hitting it and believe me you'll know the difference	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
oh crappie actually yeah i've been fishing in the the ocean we're about three hours from the ocean and i also like Spanish mackerel	3166	A
and you can catch blues and uh that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too have you ever fished off the pier	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
oh the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits	3166	A
and and jigs um they have like yellow um fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out	3166	A
yeah	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
yeah get but they're a little heavier and they're bigger get the yellow ones those are the ticket and let them_1 drop to the bottom	3166	A
and maybe do a a kind of a slow reel you don't even have to have a good rod or anything just just even a regular line and you throw it out and uh the the other thing that's real good is small um	3166	A
it's a real small repala it's about an inch and a half long and they're pure silver- all silver something real shiny about that long	3166	A
they'll go after that in a heartbeat also just anything that really shines or spins	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
oh yeah yeah that's it	3166	A
<silence>	3166	A
oh really that's neat	3166	A
oh	3166	A
	3147	B
well and	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
kids in college and how to help them_1	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yes	3147	B
and you've been through three of those	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah well i've been through once so	3147	B
how did you do it with your three	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
where were you living back then	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
okay	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah i i think there's a lot of that when you go to a school with two thousand kids there	3147	B
suddenly a college that's small seems i'm going backwards	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
so	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
well i think it was	3147	B
well a little bit of	3147	B
she narrowed it pretty rapidly to eliminate the real big ones Texas and A&M	3147	B
and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh	3147	B
the uh quality of the program it it you know Baylor was kind of always at the lead there for uh for some time	3147	B
uh she looked at Austin College	3147	B
i think she applied at Trinity but she really wasn't applying at any of the state schools	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
um accounting	3147	B
so it was a bit of of the major but not a whole lot there's a lot of campuses have business majors so that was not a big deal for her	3147	B
but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of we visited there and she visited some because her high school boyfriend's sister was there so she had spent some time there and	3147	B
felt pretty comfortable she she looked at Austin College but i think again it was the the size aspect it was just too small for somebody	3147	B
coming from Plano unless you you really felt you needed something smaller	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
so its	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh about uh eleven thousand	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
so it's uh it's sizeable but it's	3147	B
it's sort of in the not giant size	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
yeah in the case of your kids that i i guess with Jennifer it was more	3147	B
uh that	3147	B
she was making her own choice which i kind of feel is one of the keys if they're going to go do it they better they better decide where with uh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
definitely	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah well it seems uh i don't know of a whole bunch of kids who uh really do what their father did there's some i think doctors may be a place where and i don't know quite why	3147	B
that sons often follow Dad	3147	B
into the profession and maybe that's some of it takes Dad's pull to get an in and other folks can't get in as easily	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
but uh i don't have any kids who want to become engineers	3147	B
uh	3147	B
so uh	3147	B
you just kind of live with it	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah well that's the key to it is that enjoying what you're doing and uh you know i think the folks i see having more trouble picking colleges are	3147	B
i got some friends who at Arco there who uh well they're from back east and uh	3147	B
and uh their kids are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools	3147	B
when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you	3147	B
start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
but they're from back east and they got a lot of relatives there so it's uh	3147	B
some of them do that	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
<silence>	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
	3147	A
well	3147	A
let's see we're going to talk about uh	3147	A
kids	3147	A
how to pick one right	3147	A
well it	3147	A
uh three times yeah	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
well if	3147	A
well with uh John the first one he wanted to go into engineering so	3147	A
uh	3147	A
he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at good engineering schools in relatively small towns like Purdue	3147	A
in uh Lafayette Indiana we looked at uh	3147	A
Clemson and VPI	3147	A
we were living in in north Alabama at the time	3147	A
and uh we looked at Mississippi State which was in a small town in Mississippi and uh finally settled on Auburn which was in Alabama in the small town of Auburn	3147	A
and uh	3147	A
we also wanted a school that had a uh coop program	3147	A
because uh he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time	3147	A
so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him for Brian	3147	A
it that was kind of funny because he first started out thinking uh	3147	A
that he wanted to go to a small school that's what he thought when we lived in Alabama and then he moved to Plano and went to Senior High	3147	A
he figured if i can go to Senior High i can go to school any place	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
that's right	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
yeah	3147	A
so he ended up	3147	A
uh i don't remember what his original major was because_1 he changed it about three times	3147	A
at A&M but he ended up going to A&M i think because of	3147	A
uh he just thoroughly enjoyed the uh the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip	3147	A
and uh he was sold on the place	3147	A
Jana i think wanted to to stick a little closer to home	3147	A
and really didn't have a major when she went in in fact	3147	A
i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as uh Brian and John's in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like Stephen F and	3147	A
North Texas and maybe UTA and uh	3147	A
she had some idea that she might want to uh	3147	A
do something with uh physical therapy and TWU was also up in uh in Denton so if she started at one she could move to the other and might not even have to move out of her apartment	3147	A
so it was kind of close to home and there were two schools in town that uh she could commute back and forth between the two	3147	A
how did uh	3147	A
your gal picked Baylor	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
yeah	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
oh what's her major	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
sure	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
i see	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
good one in Plano yeah	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
yeah	3147	A
what is the population of Baylor i don't even know	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
oh is it okay	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
yeah yeah not like uh Austin and College Station	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
yeah it needs to be a place they want to go	3147	A
uh if they're going to be successful if they think Mom and Dad picked it or they're going there because that's where Mom and Dad went and that's what they want them to do uh that's the wrong reason for picking a place	3147	A
that's kind of the way Brian picked his first major i think he	3147	A
without asking me he thought because i was in computer science that he should do the same thing and so he started out in that arena and didn't really care for it and finally asked if i would mind if he changed and i said	3147	A
not at all because you- you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your Dad does	3147	A
so uh	3147	A
he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
well that could be	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
sure	3147	A
well and they they need to do something that they think they will enjoy	3147	A
and uh	3147	A
uh like i told Jana once she finally settled on a major she just did so much better in college than she did in high school once she found something to get excited about	3147	A
and uh whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is is immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it	3147	A
and uh so far i think she is	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
oh i know it	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
that's right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an Eastern school	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
well they feel some uh some peer pressure from their peers the parents do sometimes	3147	A
<silence>	3147	A
	3129	B
well Tom just tonight i was working on my car out of necessity and i had uh	3129	B
uh had a long age old problem of my bright lights not working uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column	3129	B
and when i would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely	3129	B
which is even worse than them just not getting bright	3129	B
and i had to presume that it was the switch and uh this is uh an older car it's a seventy two MG	3129	B
so i had to mail order the part uh which i had done and tonight i went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch	3129	B
so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh and hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
uh i had	3129	B
done what diagnosis i could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car	3129	B
and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem i talked to one mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also	3129	B
uh but i've not you know i really don't know what the problem might be it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard	3129	B
uh it might be tied into the equation somehow	3129	B
but uh	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
i i don't know i should look at that i don't remember seeing one in the uh	3129	B
in the the diagram but i'll have to go back and look at that	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
uh-huh	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
yeah that's a good idea	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
what i've typically found when that uh companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all and i hope that that's the case this time	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
right exactly it's out of uh Kansas	3129	B
somewhere	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
no it's not i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car but uh it is not either it's uh obviously doesn't quite fit	3129	B
so it must be for a different year	3129	B
so i'll have to try to return that as well	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car because i've owned this car since it was new	3129	B
and uh but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area	3129	B
and i hadn't used him for some years and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of uh all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh German cars and	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
German cars i'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on British cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it	3129	B
so uh uh i may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work so i'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out	3129	B
i've not had to- to exchange any other parts recently uh	3129	B
because they were defective now i've had had pretty good luck i just however did uh have to get a	3129	B
a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players	3129	B
uh repaired i'd purchased it at at Sam's and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty and i should have checked more carefully and and done a better job of saving the receipt	3129	B
because uh i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by uh some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play	3129	B
and as it turned out it had a full year's warranty and i could have gotten it repaired for free but i i had to to take it in while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost	3129	B
uh but it didn't do me any good because i had i had missed the window by about a week or two so i didn't even i didn't really uh even bring it up when i went in to pick it up	3129	B
but uh that's really my only experience in the past year where i've had to take a product back because of a defect	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
good grief	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
uh-huh	3129	B
	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
huh	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
my goodness	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
huh	3129	B
<silence>	3129	B
<silence>	3129	A
yeah	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
exactly	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
oh	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
did- did- did you do the diagnosis or- or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
yeah i know uh when working with the uh flashers	3129	A
there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
diagram	3129	A
yeah i don't even know if my uh current cars have a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are uh	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
things running uh while they're at the same unit like the little- the headlamp	3129	A
you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam uh requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse	3129	A
so that's a possibility	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for uh old imports	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
who-	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
um so it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
yeah have you found any uh uh reliable import service people in the metroplex	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
oh yeah	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
i'll be darned	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
oh my goodness	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
oh no	3129	A
<silence>	3129	A
well ours wasn't within the last year i guess it's been within the last two years uh	3129	A
Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new and it's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh	3129	A
i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort	3129	A
and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems it was	3129	A
idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that uh we park on a on a hill under our car port and	3129	A
when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you	3129	A
and the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit	3129	A
so we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place	3129	A
and asked them to check it out and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again	3129	A
i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around but the	3129	A
second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their uh service reports from region or headquarters whatever and	3129	A
and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part	3129	A
and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine	3129	A
for a a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don't- we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven	3129	A
-TV show	3179	A
huh why	3179	A
	3179	A
<silence>	3179	A
um-hum	3179	A

<silence>	3138	A
right	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah that that's about the same boat i'm in too	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh five	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
oh yeah well i'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too so	3138	A
and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
oh yeah well see i my- my oldest is nine and he already he already does that	3138	A
and i told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
um	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
my husband and i our favorite meal is um and we do it like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak and he does the steak and then uh	3138	A
uh-huh and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does and it's real good and uh i do sauteed mushrooms so and asparagus and that's our favorite	3138	A
dinner	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah so do we	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
it's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
i don't know what that i don't see how you eat that but	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
oh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
so it	3138	A
yeah it defeats the purpose	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
oh yeah yeah my husband makes those i'm not i don't eat enchiladas i i don't like enchiladas- i don't like the texture- i don't know i guess it's the texture or something i don't like the taste of enchiladas but everyone else in my family does	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
i don't know i it's i don't know what i don't know i i don't know what it is about the enchiladas i just and i'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother i'm the only one that doesn't eat it but my kids love it you know	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah i've got a chicken casserole that's like that that that i've	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah because i when i make this chicken casserole i it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that i freeze	3138	A
so or i give it to my Mom and Dad if i know we're not going to eat	3138	A
it's just- you can use chicken or turkey because_1 my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey	3138	A
and it's rice and i- i- i when i do recipes i just throw stuff in i don't i'm not real good about measuring because i just i do it to taste	3138	A
and	3138	A
well yeah but it it's like it's just chicken it it's as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice	3138	A
and celery and that's it and some hard boiled eggs	3138	A
and that's it you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through and you sprinkle uh that those um toasted onion rings	3138	A
on top of it for the crunchy and that's it you know and it it it goes and it's filling because of the rice	3138	A
so	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh-huh yeah	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah it gives it a an extra yeah little tang	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah that cholesterol fat free	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
i know	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
i don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
i know	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah we did the low-cal stuff well with my kids i don't they get enough sugar and stuff anyway mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway and they don't need any added help	3138	A
so when we're here at home	3138	A
you know with sweets and stuff they they don't we don't really do that much i do a lot of fruits	3138	A
instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that and and drink wise they have Kool-Aid milk or water normally now when they go to their grandmother's house	3138	A
which is every weekend it's a it's a different	3138	A
it's a different story all around	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
uh-huh that's exactly what it is	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
oh really	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
no not yet	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
huh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
huh	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
	3138	A
<silence>	3138	A
	3138	B
okay i guess we're going to discuss food and cooking	3138	B
do you enjoy cooking	3138	B
	3138	B
i'm kind of that way too when i have i i enjoy cooking when i have time	3138	B
i don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
it gets kind of boring	3138	B
how big is the family you cook for	3138	B
uh-huh we have four so	3138	B
and two of them are teenage boys so	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
are they	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah yeah we have that problem too but also now it's just the amount that they eat it's just absolutely incredible	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
does he well	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah that's true uh	3138	B
do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
favorite recipes that you've come across or	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
out on the grill uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
oh	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
	3138	B
ooh yeah	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
ooh that's sound good i love that	3138	B
my husband really likes seafood	3138	B
um and uh i think that no matter what i do i don't serve enough of it really to uh to suit him i didn't grow up eating that much seafood	3138	B
and um so i don't know it's just kind of not natural to me but i like it and uh i don't know one of his favorite things is uh	3138	B
well it's called seafood stew and it's really it's really like a soup- soup that that you serve over rice	3138	B
and uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it and	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
no no that's kind of Louisiana i think if you do that yeah i don't either	3138	B
but uh no this is just really- it is really good and and one thing that's good is it makes the a large amount and so i freeze- usually we eat one and i freeze two containers of it then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice	3138	B
but neither of my kids will eat it you know so then they eat a pizza or	3138	B
	3138	B
yeah it really does one thing i've run across	3138	B
recently though a friend gave me a recipe that i really like for chicken enchiladas have you made them	3138	B
does he ooh	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
well are these are done with a flour tortilla is that what he uses yeah	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
isn't that something yeah	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
i was going to say my kids both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for company too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time	3138	B
when i needed to make something to uh to give somebody you know like you know to take over to somebody's house or something else	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
it it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family and then uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
what what does it have in it	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
sure	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
 yeah	3138	B
uh-huh sure sometimes those are the best ones	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah ooh that sounds good	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
oh yeah those are good aren't they uh-huh	3138	B
um	3138	B
that sounds good	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
right	3138	B
you cook the rice before you put it in yeah	3138	B
i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good	3138	B
i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free	3138	B
yeah that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many	3138	B
new things like that because like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a low- low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing	3138	B
you know and now it's it's it's okay and you can even i used to just put a tiny bit in well now i'm just putting more and more in	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah and it's only it used to be like a hundred- hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's like twelve oh i just think that's the best thing to have happened i'm just so excited about that	3138	B
anyway	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yes	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
right	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
	3138	B
<silence>	3138	B
that's when they	3138	B
as our family would say a pig out huh	3138	B
that's good oh one of my boys that that's twelve um is has high cholesterol	3138	B
have you ever found out about your kids	3138	B
and my other one does not so oh year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down	3138	B
it's i think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol he's never eaten any eggs he's never had anything but skim milk and you know i've never bought butter and things like that but um	3138	B
oh he just left for the doctor again and it's it's kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh	3138	B
so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days	3138	B
so all that kind of stuff does really help well i think we've probably talked long enough and	3138	B
	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
 i'm a substitute- i'm a substitute teacher is is this Pat i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
oh okay	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
oh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
well	3115	B
what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
yes	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off	3115	B
and it's it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual	3115	B
uh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
right and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week	3115	B
and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some	3115	B
sort of hat	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many schools on a particular day during uh	3115	B
i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which	3115	B
right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
yeah	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think	3115	B
but it i think it varies it it just so much anything anything can go	3115	B
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they're all pretty fancy	3115	B
but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other departments that aren't and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might	3115	B
might say	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
right	3115	B
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
or you're going to be observed	3115	B
	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
yeah	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
right they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
yeah well at Vines the coaches don't do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
but they they don't look you know they don't wear their sweat pants or or anything they're they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in PE	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
those i can understand yeah	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
i don't think we'll ever get to that uh no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times- they've had uniforms for years i really- don't really know if they still do	3115	B
it certainly makes it easier to dress	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
yeah but i doubt that that would come about- that that will come about just i yeah i i i	3115	B
no not yeah	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
<silence>	3115	B
yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but	3115	B
	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
all right and and your occupation is teaching	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
substitute teacher	3115	A
yes it is it is uh-huh	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right well i was just trying to make an introduction here	3115	A
but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now	3115	A
i've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right i well not really i've got the every day i've got to uh read to kindergartners so i'm going to be down on the floor with them i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day	3115	A
for uh you know a half hour so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do	3115	A
because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
well of course you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold	3115	A
but you don't know uh	3115	A
i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
subtract right	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
i i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools that's one of things one of the things i ask about	3115	A
you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing	3115	A
and and i said well you know that was okay and i'm basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in the winter you know i just add a	3115	A
maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer	3115	A
that's about	3115	A
i don't i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and	3115	A
you know look really	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
yeah	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right right	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right right	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right on what Thursday- Thursday	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right right so that would kind of give you	3115	A
a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time	3115	A
of what's going on that so that's	3115	A
and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they gonna put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties	3115	A
and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh	3115	A
dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top and and uh	3115	A
i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they can- have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right right right	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
yeah there- there's a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others right	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right	3115	A
well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there	3115	A
there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if uh that teaches health or	3115	A
English- you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie i some of those male coaches that might really	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
 right and a T-shirt	3115	A
right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so	3115	A
whether	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
change then well see that's what i would think	3115	A
that's what i would think	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
course we had had one coach one period he'd teach PE and the next period Health and then a period of PE and and that's hard you know so he just left warm-ups on but	3115	A
but uh no i think really probably they could they could uh	3115	A
really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and	3115	A
you don't think so	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
well some of them yes they do and and it's not at some of the private schools but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
well i i think it would make a difference at school i i don't think we should be spending time	3115	A
saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts- too shorts too short or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know i mean	3115	A
 it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we can't to that either i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear	3115	A
a button down shirt you know that would that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks	3115	A
and they could buy them anywhere they wanted and you know and	3115	A
and then the girls could	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
right i don't no not in Plano	3115	A
they may get away- but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
Highland Park's thinking about going that route	3115	A
so it	3115	A
and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do	3115	A
<silence>	3115	A
yeah i agree with you on	3115	A
<silence>	3150	B
so how do you feel about capital punishment	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
really	3150	B
oh i'm pretty much for it	3150	B
 we'll have some interesting discussion i guess	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
wrongfully yeah yeah	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
yeah it would never be equal	3150	B
right	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
right yeah	3150	B
well i guess	3150	B
you know i i guess i can see it from several different perspectives but	3150	B
you know when i hear about things like you know what they've what they've been reporting about in Milwaukee	3150	B
you know i- i- i to me i don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy you know maybe there is i don't know	3150	B
but you know and	3150	B
you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society he's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation	3150	B
i mean i don't know i just i really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko	3150	B
and you know for the things he's done i don't know i guess it's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life	3150	B
you know or or capital punishment i guess you know and	3150	B
it-	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
uh-huh	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
oh really uh-huh uh-huh	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
right	3150	B
yeah well i can understand- i i mean you know there there is always that chance but you know	3150	B
i guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i don't i mean i don't know but uh you know	3150	B
that that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be	3150	B
you know you you you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really	3150	B
but uh	3150	B
uh you know when i when you find somebody just like that situation i mean it was disgusting when i read about it today and and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven	3150	B
i i'd you know i guess i have a hard time feeling merciful toward him and you know	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
right	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
right	3150	B
right and trying to rehabilitate him too and you know	3150	B
right exactly you know and nobody wants that you know know everybody would be just be scared to death	3150	B
you know we've we've had a real problem here in Texas with uh prison overcrowding and they've been releasing people left and right and you know they've committed murders and rapes and everything else and	3150	B
you know you just think you know where's the justice here i mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
oh really	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
uh-huh	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
uh-huh	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
right exactly yeah well you know that's exactly i mean	3150	B
i'm i'm not saying i i think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know and i i think there's a a shadow of a doubt	3150	B
you know like like with this this guy in in Milwaukee i mean it he pretty much confessed to it i mean they you know just everything i mean cannibalism and everything else uh	3150	B
i- i really would have a hard time especially if i was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed yeah	3150	B
because_1 i mean that's just awful	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
right- right and well i have a hunch- i have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either i mean you know they i don't know from from what i hear about jail life is not any- any way to live but uh	3150	B
i don't know it's just	3150	B
and i	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
um-hum	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
really	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
that	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
yeah well you know especially- especially like repeat offenders it it just appalls me that they can be out	3150	B
you know they even get a a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years	3150	B
you know that's that's scary because you know i'm not sure	3150	B
i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not	3150	B
right	3150	B
and it it's it's really scary i mean- you know i i don't know what the perfect solution to that is but i know that especially with violent crimes where you know you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else you know then	3150	B
i don't know i i guess	3150	B
i i just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee you know for instance i mean that's just i could see capital punishment in a case like that	3150	B
and you know for for other people too that do things like that	3150	B
but uh when uh my wife and i are both participating in this survey and she picked up the phone and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment so she was uh	3150	B
 yeah well luckily it was for me because_1 they won't uh they- they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other	3150	B
so she tried to enter her number and it wouldn't work so she said whew it's for you so	3150	B
but uh you know i don't know i i struggle with it but i i really think that in	3150	B
in terms like this i	3150	B
i think that it that it might not be such a bad thing	3150	B
because i don't know that anybody would- in i don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community you know i i i'm sure- you'd have to be scared to death	3150	B
<silence>	3150	B
<silence>	3150	A
well it's i am pretty much against it	3150	A
yeah how about you	3150	A
oh good we can have a debate	3150	A
well like um	3150	A
i don't know i can't- think that i one of the reasons that i'm against it is that uh um i'm afraid- afraid of someone losing their life for something- um wrongly	3150	A
right and another reason one- one of the arguments that really i really actually- actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really uh uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh	3150	A
you know someone said to me once well imagine if- if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldn't you want to see them killed	3150	A
for the punishment but then i thought about it and i thought well the loss that i would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them	3150	A
how about you	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
yeah that's true	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
um-hum	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
right well you know that's true because uh my- but a lot of um these conversations i've had on this program this	3150	A
these telephone conversations have revolved around um	3150	A
criminal	3150	A
	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
um-hum	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
right especially when it's so far removed if it's no one that i know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life	3150	A
letting him out again	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
um-hum	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
uh-huh	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
that's true you know i just recently moved to Massachusetts i'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but uh	3150	A
	3150	A
and i guess they said you know should- do you think it should be restricted i guess if it were if if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment i guess violent crimes would be the	3150	A
crimes where i can see it making the most sense you know violent crimes with no uh with just malicious intent	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
yeah	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
hang	3150	A
and what is he going to do in prison to the other people	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
right	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back she was off drugs and everything but she said you know	3150	A
in prison you can get anything you can get any drugs you want there's you can- it's just like being outside you know people find ways around and and there's a power structure that you have to bow to and	3150	A
and it really isn't for some people that- who have been there uh for over and over and over it really isn't uh as bad- i mean there it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect	3150	A
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation and	3150	A
maybe that's why one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it's not so scary anymore	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
right and what they're going to be doing when they get out	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
handed it to you	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
oh oh i see	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
	3150	A
<silence>	3150	A
well maybe if they could um if they had more money or more more resources to work more on rehabilitation i mean deep down i think every every human	3150	A
	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
well which colleges did they go to	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
that's a beautiful school beautiful school	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
well i guess the question then becomes how did you all make the selection or did you just let them do them by themselves	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
well that's true of course uh you know i- for me my son he's only six and but i had the experience with my sister going to school and she was i treated my sister almost like my daughter because she was nine ten years younger than i was and	3117	B
she ended up going to the University of Oklahoma	3117	B
i can say that because it was a big well known school it had a well known education and it was a wonderful education but yet it was a small school	3117	B
whereas i went to the University of Texas which was you know a million people go there	3117	B
i think that for me it's going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big	3117	B
it's way too big	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
yes yes i'm i'm quite aware	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
Texas only had fifty five thousand when i was there	3117	B
and- and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction between uh students i knew everybody within my dorm but that was it	3117	B
because the school was just too big and whereas my sister when i went to visit her she knew everybody on the whole durn campus	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
so uh course now we're we're already telling our son you know Texas- uh Oklahoma's good and Arkansas is good now of course Texas is good only because you know	3117	B
i went- because i went there of course but uh	3117	B
we're going my parents let me choose on my own and i want to pretty much allow him to choose on his own but i kind of keep an ear open as to what he's doing	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
well i was when i was in Louisiana in Shreveport i would go to any school except LSU i did not want to school in the in the same state	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
luckily i still have twelve more years to worry about it	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
right now they do now if the uh legislature has their way about it they gonna to uh raise tuition- tuition in in double	3117	B
and see back when i went to school there when i first entered the school it cost me two hundred dollars as an out as an out of state student	3117	B
but then i was there for about two and a half years they then switched it to forty dollars per semester hour so almost overnight i went from two hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars	3117	B
and i have to admit uh	3117	B
i wasn't i wasn't quite ready for that one	3117	B
it took me only about twelve years after i graduated to finish paying off the bill but that's	3117	B
but at least i was one of the good guys i did pay my bill off in full yes i did yeah	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
yeah	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
well what about the University of Virginia how much did it end- end up costing	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
that's a long way	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
uh that's not too bad	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
now did she get to did she get to live in the dorm on that uh very front row you know that goes up by the rotunda	3117	B
	3117	B
	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
	3117	B
when we went to visit it we didn't know what it was and my little kid he was opening every one of the mailboxes looking inside to see what he could find	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
yeah	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
yeah we went on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year and we went to visit that was the very last thing we saw was at the tail end of the Parkway we had we had a blast	3117	B
it is it it i can see why you want to go there that's	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
uh-huh and of course you've got to go to say hello to Monticello yeah yeah	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
huh	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
	3117	B
well i tell you what i've enjoyed talking i'm going to go ahead and hang up on this end because it's just about time for supper so	3117	B
actually it it was a fun conversation i enjoyed it	3117	B
<silence>	3117	B
congratulations- well congratulations-	3117	B
	3117	A
okay well having uh personally uh helped uh two children attend or or to select colleges one of them not very successfully	3117	A
i'm not sure if i'm any authority on this topic at all	3117	A
well our daughter uh went to the University of Virginia that was a good selection she	3117	A
yeah really is and she was she was very very happy there and very- and very successful in what she picked to do so uh she's just graduated from there so that was a good selection	3117	A
uh our son has this kind of you know he's	3117	A
well he started out going Stephen F Austin and that turned turned into you know flunking out because of of of uh too many parties going on then he stayed out of school for a while then he went to Richland for a couple of years and then he went to	3117	A
to DePaul in Chicago which would have been great but uh it was so expensive so now he's now he's back	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
well in in that case with him uh he kind of made the selections by himself and i think that we should have given him more direction and	3117	A
he was our first you know so we we didn't have quite the insight that uh that we would have had if he'd been our second like we did with Karen so uh	3117	A
but i i think you know i- just in terms of of what happened i think that first of all i'd i would know the reputation of the school	3117	A
and uh for more than just academics but you know if it's a party school or not although i think every school is a party school to some degree personally	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
right	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
right	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
right	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
yeah i've heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma	3117	A
yeah and uh when i was there it was maybe eleven or twelve thousand people which was just a great size i thought it's it's	3117	A
oh gosh is awful	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh-huh yeah	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
yes that that's true it makes a lot of difference and uh	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
you went to school there yeah right uh-huh	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
sure oh yeah yeah well our daughter chose uh Virginia because she didn't want to go to school in Texas i mean she just sort of didn't want to go to school here	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
yeah same deal	3117	A
yeah and uh in fact she was accepted at two schools in Texas uh Rice and Trinity but she decided she wanted to go out of state and uh	3117	A
Virginia was uh you know in the east it wasn't a you know it wasn't an Ivy League school but it was well it's further- quite a bit further east and it was uh	3117	A
of the state schools that she could have gone to it was but one of the cheapest yet one of the best too- you know with the the academics and the tradition and everything that is there uh she made a really good selection we thought and	3117	A
so uh uh she pretty much made that herself- herself but she did have some others in the wings you know there's another school that she she would've have have gone to if she hadn't been accepted there	3117	A
so uh i don't know i think it- it really depends a lot on the child because our daughter is was just a lot more levelheaded about her process- the process	3117	A
yeah so uh but you know i guess you have to really look at your finances and uh Texas has such a bargain in education i mean	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
i know i know	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh that's something	3117	A
uh	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
oh wow	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
my gosh	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
that was a shocker	3117	A
no i'll bet not	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
yeah yeah yeah i know how that is	3117	A
you you did pay yours good yeah my husband went to school on loans too and and we he was able you know we paid his off after we were married but uh well i'm at the university of Texas at Dallas and as a graduate student and uh	3117	A
you know i have to say that uh it's a real bargain i mean for as far as i'm concerned it's been a real bargain of course you know living at home makes a lot of difference if i had to to pay room and board somewhere that would make a lot of difference uh in	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh i think uh on a yearly basis i'm trying to think i would just make it a rough figure of about	3117	A
uh with with the travel expenses and so on although she didn't come home that much actually i would say between twelve and thirteen thousand a year	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
it's not when you look at the you know the school and the fact that she was	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
uh no on the lawn no no that's that's an honor that's bestowed on very few and she didn't get to do that although she knew people who did live there but yeah that's that would have been neat	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
 well you know the graduation takes place right there on the lawn on on that in that big fat grassy area and uh	3117	A
they had four thousand graduates this spring and boy that was quite an event i'll tell you	3117	A
oh yeah	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
that's a great place to visit that really is yeah	3117	A
yeah well they're just so it's just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know they're they still talk about Mister Jefferson you know i mean the founder of the school of course was Mister Jefferson- Thomas Jefferson and they and and a lot of	3117	A
right uh-huh and and a lot of the of his traditions i mean for instance they don't call the students freshmen sophomore junior senior they call them first year second year third year and fourth year because Mister Jefferson felt that one's education never ended	3117	A
and to you put those four designations of freshmen sophomore and so on on the person's education limited them	3117	A
and he felt that you could go on to school forever you should just have the number of years that you were there attached to your name if you want to do identify someone so	3117	A
i had to be very careful about talking about seniors or fourth year students you got to get the terminology right	3117	A
yes	3117	A
all righty	3117	A
<silence>	3117	A
yes it certainly is i got to go make it here	3117	A
well i i this is my last one you're number ten of ten that i i	3117	A
	3118	A
okay do you want to start	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
now that do you do you agree that they should all be unanimous	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
or even even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
uh-huh	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees	3118	A
so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
and they have to stay in until they all agree yeah i don't know i'm not sure if they go i mean to twelve new people	3118	A
 or what they do exactly but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either you know either he or she can either go free or to jail either one	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
that's just that's just it i don't understand you're supposed to you know go in if you have you know like if you've never heard of the people before or anything	3118	A
but i don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total totally impartial to it	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
yeah i agree i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over	3118	A
you know so it it's i- i- i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know	3118	A
i- i don't know if it's the way it is in real life but i've seen it on TV where the juries go one way and the judge totally- totally finds it obnoxious and he completely you know goes the other way	3118	A
now i'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
	3118	A
	3118	A
i- i think it's just i don't i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get but i just think it's really hard- you know i mean some cases go on for years you know	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
i- i don't know how it could be more fair	3118	A
	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
	3118	A
i know i don't know that much about it either	3118	A
	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
i don't	3118	A
i- i don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
oh i think we can hang up anytime	3118	A
<silence>	3118	A
no i don't know what else to say so	3118	A
it was nice talking to you too bye	3118	A
	3118	A
<silence>	3118	B
okay um	3118	B
i haven't i don't know that much about the possible- what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but	3118	B
um i think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide	3118	B
	3118	B
i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new unanimous	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
	3118	B
i don't	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
i don't know i don't know if i feel i don't feel real strongly about that if the um the thing is though i- i didn't think that even if it was a lower conviction i didn't think that you could	3118	B
um i didn't think that you really had to have a a jury	3118	B
unless i guess if you request one you can but i think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might um	3118	B
	3118	B
	3118	B
and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
yeah well if it's no but they they what if they never agree doesn't it just um do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
agree	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
yeah	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
yeah and that maybe on the lesser	3118	B
crimes that aren't too severe that's a little stringent	3118	B
especially because there's twelve the thing about it is i think jury selection too a lot of times um	3118	B
the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way too	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
i know i don't think well i guess you really can't but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either	3118	B
so um but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they	3118	B
they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements too	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
i know	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
yeah	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
i think in some cases they are but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's you know so that's another thing where they have the power but	3118	B
 maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair maybe there should be more than twelve people i don't	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
	3118	B
i know i don't know	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
	3118	B
and lose their not lose their jobs but not go to work	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
it could be	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
really i've never seen one in real life either so i don't have you know i don't know that much about it but i think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries i don't know how we could make it more fair i really don't	3118	B
the unanimous vote is questionable though and and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
because uh	3118	B
	3118	B
i don't know if you should have- really- really have a jury for small- a small	3118	B
 infraction	3118	B
	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
right	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
no whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique i think when they started it	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
okay um in um what do i do now do you know anything or just wait for someone else	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
okay- okay well it was nice talking with you	3118	B
thanks bye-bye	3118	B
<silence>	3118	B
	3168	A
okay uh well since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing	3168	A
uh i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and i feel	3168	A
i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and the such i'd feel much more comfortable than i do now based on what i've been hearing in the newspapers	3168	A
so i really don't have a problem with it	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
yeah	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
yeah i well i happen to be uh my job is i'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company	3168	A
so i it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing and even in our field we have people that are in	3168	A
very high risk jobs and we at the present time do not have random testing and i am pushing towards that i- i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide	3168	A
they shouldn't have a problem with it	3168	A
and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because we're talking- we're talking	3168	A
major liabilities not only with themselves but with other employees	3168	A
and i really you know they they're talking about sports	3168	A
sports personalities and all this type of thing but i would much much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested	3168	A
 on a random basis i- i have a real fear of that at some point something's going to happen and they're showing it with AIDS so why you know they should- they ought to start doing something with the drugs so i really have no problem with it	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
yes	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
oh really	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
well that scares me because if this- that's the way they are	3168	A
i if i were a dentist i'd wanna be protected too	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
 right	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
	3168	A
well you where you're located i- i do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing	3168	A
and i think they've had it for several years and their program they had i don't think had a lot of uh problems	3168	A
associated with it but uh my brother-in-law happens to work there and it- it sounded very positive and i- i think it's great i- i would like i would encourage it i'm pushing our company towards that and also	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
right	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
exactly	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
right	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
ours is changing yeah ours ours is changing it's increasing i live in a i live in a very nice suburb and it's it's it's unbelievable what what what's going on and	3168	A
the drugs the selling of drugs it's just it's just too loose it's too free	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
really	3168	A
<silence>	3168	A
	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
yeah uh i don't either i uh i've never worked- i don't work at home right now i stay home with my children um but my husband works and they do have that at at his place of employment and	3168	B
neither of us have a problem with it we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such it's uh it's a scary thing to know that uh you just don't know what people are doing uh before they go to work	3168	B
so and the the advertisements on television lately have been so um there've been so many you know there's uh	3168	B
 just about like train train- train wrecks and things like that that i feel like probably just for our own safety and- when we're traveling and things that would be something i'd like to know that's going on	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
um	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
right	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
um-hum	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
yeah	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
yeah well it's it's unfortunate i think that everyone doesn't have that opinion um some people just yeah i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that but uh	3168	B
in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the um the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know they feel that's not fair and whatever but	3168	B
you know those kind of things too i'd like to know myself it wouldn't be in my opinion i i've had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist i went to didn't even use gloves at all so	3168	B
that kind of yeah and uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me um but	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
well you would think so that is because uh well and i worked for a dentist and that's uh you know you you come in contact with a lot of of blood and things like that and	3168	B
it's real real dangerous i- i would think but with all the accidents	3168	B
just with with uh everything happening just- airlines just drive me crazy people are afraid to fly now you know just because_1 they don't know what their pilot's been doing and and things like that and	3168	B
i don't know	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
uh-huh	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs then they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support	3168	B
and- and whatever because a lot of people seems like would probably obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things and	3168	B
too many people are just dying particularly in our area i don't know what the crime is like where you are but the crime rate here is just astronomical	3168	B
<silence>	3168	B
um-hum i just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these i- i have two little very little children under two and i got a piece of paper from from my husband's office it's talking about these uh drug tattoos now	3168	B
that they have got that look like it looks like a sticker and it's for kids-	3168	B
there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
that week right	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
um	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
well um i uh right now i'm into a weird situation i'm a graduate student and uh	3107	A
uh i don't have that many benefits per se	3107	A
um	3107	A
sort of get	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um	3107	A
uh i think health insurance is real real important	3107	A
uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um	3107	A
a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance	3107	A
they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical they they force you to buy here now i'm covered by my wife's anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester	3107	A
for uh mandatory so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case i'd rather that that went to something else	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars	3107	A
sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're very- they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians	3107	A
so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um	3107	A
but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job i don't you know	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
oh wow so that's the real	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
yeah i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off they you know usually let her	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
oh really	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
no	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
that's oh that's a	3107	A
that's reasonable i think	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
weigh are see such of things	3107	A
yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance	3107	A
and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
um-hum	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
right	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
at least us who decides	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
right	3107	A
<silence>	3107	A
right you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that that's the	3107	A
	3107	B
boy i- i i don't know that's a that's a a tough one uh uh and it's uh i suppose it's it's	3107	B
changes as uh as perception- my perception changes of of what uh i'm getting gypped on this week or this month uh uh	3107	B
uh we're just uh going through uh uh well there's a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh	3107	B
if i step back i'm not sure i'd i'd uh say that what what about you	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
oh okay	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
 yes	3107	B
okay but but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
	3107	B
right okay	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
and and yeah and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
uh yeah i it uh	3107	B
the that- that is- that's a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there it's uh if i remember right you well if they	3107	B
they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh	3107	B
two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i i'm coming up on i've been at TI now uh uh	3107	B
coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah that's a that that is a a a negative but uh	3107	B
but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
well that that yeah that's uh that- that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh	3107	B
that's the the the uh yeah that- that's uh why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour	3107	B
and uh and but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing	3107	B
uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh	3107	B
the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different but uh	3107	B
but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh the they've uh uh	3107	B
gone through a couple years ago here where they	3107	B
uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now they're in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that	3107	B
just routine visits uh ah they will	3107	B
compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh	3107	B
to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to uh uh give you	3107	B
you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're you're not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh i'm not i'm not sure it my uh	3107	B
one of the phrases i use is that that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of	3107	B
always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides here it's it's uh	3107	B
yeah uh and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh	3107	B
idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i	3107	B
i don't know in in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh	3107	B
although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better	3107	B
<silence>	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
yeah and	3107	B
okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and and um trying to do go to school back to college again so it's	3193	A
it's uh exercise is kind of forget it	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
they sure do yeah my daughter	3193	A
yeah yeah uh she's three so three with a i think it's almost like she's got this endless	3193	A
energy i mean it's no longer nap time that kind of thing so	3193	A
yes yeah so	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
yeah	3193	A
exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of uh she's an only child too so it's it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's	3193	A
	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
um-hum sure sure	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
yeah uh-huh	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
um-hum sure	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
um-hum -sure	3193	A
 sure	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
sure	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
yeah yeah that's about what uh basically if we can get out and take a walk it's	3193	A
it's great but uh most of the time we can't so it's uh we're too busy doing other things but that also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
oh sure	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
sure	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
sure	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
to loosen it up yeah yeah that's true	3193	A
so yeah-	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
oh yes	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
so oh boy	3193	A
sure trying to keep up with the nineteen months uh sure they're into everything	3193	A
the baby hm	3193	A
oh he was cranky	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
sure once you lose that sure that's very true	3193	A
it wasn't too long ago where i was doing the same thing and that uh totally gets your mental capabilities uh thrown off totally when they're	3193	A
uh tired and uh you wake up in the middle of the night and it's my daughter used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that so	3193	A
daddy just came home so the house is starting to liven up here now but uh that's about it that's kind of how my exercise is right now is just basically running after a three year old	3193	A
so	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
um-hum	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
um-hum	3193	A
<silence>	3193	A
it sure does yeah	3193	A
sure sure well it was really nice talking to you then	3193	A
okay um-hum thank you um-hum bye now	3193	A
	3193	A
 okay-	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
well it	3193	B
 but if it well- if i remember back to when i had a child they give you a lot of exercise just what age is your child	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
uh-huh	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
oh she's given up the naps	3193	B
	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
oh right and so many people work nowadays there you know there's not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either	3193	B
but well my main uh exercise the only one i've ever stuck to at all is walking	3193	B
and i try to get out and walk two miles	3193	B
most everyday but but it you know it fluctuates i'll do real good for a while and then i'll be off of it for a while just depending on what's happened but the last uh	3193	B
couple of uh years uh my husband is an accountant and he moved his office to the house and i work for him	3193	B
so that helps because we're at home and i can get out and walk a lot better than when i was working in an office	3193	B
so that has helped	3193	B
but anything else uh	3193	B
well we have a lake house and down there when we go down there some on weekends we get a different type of exercise you know just doing a lot of work and things down there	3193	B
but that and uh and walking is about it	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
um-hum i will admit though when i	3193	B
do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and	3193	B
uh i really do uh and and i smoke and i can tell that it just immediately if i've been coughing or something you know it just immediately seems to clear my lungs up	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
but um	3193	B
well i got a lot of exercise though the last four or five days i have two grandchildren	3193	B
three months and nineteen months and my daughter and son-in-law went on a	3193	B
	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
well and the baby was sick so he wasn't good you know so it took- was one on one i mean i had to take one and he had to take the other one and it was busy	3193	B
and they woke up all during the night and i'm not uh used to that	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
uh-huh	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
um-hum	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
um um-hum	3193	B
<silence>	3193	B
 right uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep it also made me think of one other thing walking	3193	B
does for me when i do it it does help me mentally you know if i'm worried about something or whatever and i get out and do that	3193	B
walk it just i don't know it just sort of helps your mental attitude too	3193	B
so i miss that when i don't do it	3193	B
but	3193	B
well nice to talk to you	3193	B
 bye bye	3193	B
	3193	B
 all right this is easy for me since i	3186	A
yeah well i travel i do about forty percent of my time is on the road	3186	A
i eat a lot of meals out um well i'm also married my wife is A1 cook but she enjoys eating out so i have to	3186	A
share it with her and uh actually it's very easy for me because i- i have a practice- make it a practice when i am out i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here	3186	A
so- so i look for just about anything and it's it's uh	3186	A
it's a lot of fun i don't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because_1 i you know	3186	A
oh sure yeah and it's it's really great i- i	3186	A
 i like different types of food	3186	A
<silence>	3186	A
uh oh you name- okay you name it let's see you've got one down in uh	3186	A
 down near uh Addison	3186	A
um there's two restaurants that i particularly like that i eat every time i get into Texas or i get into Atlanta Georgia i make sure i go and that's Houston's	3186	A
yep okay	3186	A
it's it's great there's a a restaurant in um	3186	A
right outside of Reading Pennsylvania it's called Alfredo's	3186	A
that does not look like	3186	A
a restaurant that you would really wanna recommend to a lot of people but it is fabulous- fantastic	3186	A
 uh there's a restaurant and i don't recall the name of it uh in uh Panama City of course not too people wanna rush back to Panama City uh	3186	A
Panama	3186	A
the country Panama	3186	A
okay-	3186	A
 no this is the country this is the country Panama all right	3186	A
and uh	3186	A
but i have gotten to quite a few and i go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there i	3186	A
you know and i know the locations and i know the places but i lot of times i don't remember the names i'd have to go back through some expense reports	3186	A
 but particularly in down in your area i'm looking for some some more restaurants	3186	A

yeah i	3186	A
they've been doing that when uh the circuits are busy	3186	A

bye-bye	3186	A
	3186	A
	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B

<silence>	3186	B

<silence>	3186	B
sure	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
i was gonna ask you could you go to you know nice places and	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
	3186	B
so where are your places- what- what are places you- you know memorable places you've eaten	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
oh Houston's uh-huh	3186	B
it's a great place	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
oh okay because_1 i was thinking well i- i grew up in Panama City i get it	3186	B
 right	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
do you like Mexican do you like Mexican food oh	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
 well i mean there's so many places here you know they're just it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here	3186	B
but in the Addison well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area anyway	3186	B
i mean now there's a new Italian place called Sfuzzi	3186	B
that has a great i've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas and now there's one in Addison	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
it's F S it's S F U Z I	3186	B
 and it's on it's in Addison and it's a great place also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copeland's	3186	B
oh i really like Copeland's	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
oh the yeah the i know no i don't like that place	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
see uh uh yeah actually- actually when i went i thought the food was not good	3186	B
Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of	3186	B
see i when i went i thought the people drove me crazy first of all but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was	3186	B
	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
do you like like Southwestern	3186	B
well now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill	3186	B
that's on Beltline that's close to Houston's a matter of fact and um	3186	B
it's great i mean they're they have i think sometimes i've been when i thought well it wasn't as good but i went there recently and i thought well this really is good	3186	B
so that's that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill	3186	B
and um	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
a whole new dining experience	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
well they haven't beeped us have they	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
oh i thought sometimes they say you know this is three minutes or whatever	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
okay	3186	B
<silence>	3186	B
okay well thanks for calling for helping us out bye-bye	3186	B
	3186	B
okay um does is this something that concerns you	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
uh-huh	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
right	3143	B
yeah well i live outside of Dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year	3143	B
in Dallas and that worries me	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah there's a little boy that just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is	3143	B
you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet	3143	B
that's really sad i've so you know it must be frustrating-	3143	B
frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that	3143	B
be so scary	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
it really doesn't it's kind of scary i think that uh	3143	B
i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient	3143	B
i think that's part of the problem	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded you know let them suffer a little bit	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah it- the other thing that worries me about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill	3143	B
people they i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
oh	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
seems like if they had immediate- more immediate uh consequences to their actions it would sink in faster	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
 really yeah	3143	B
yeah because_1 it seems like now even in the country you hear about	3143	B
bad things happening so	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
me either	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that	3143	B
it seems scarier	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah that's scary it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because	3143	B
they won't let them hire any new ones and they keep leaving	3143	B
<silence>	3143	B
huh yeah they figure what a heyday huh	3143	B
it really is well there's someone at the door so i guess i'll have to go see what my dog is barking about but it was nice talking to you	3143	B
well thanks same for you bye	3143	B
	3143	B
<silence>	3143	A
well i think it does um especially because i just moved to Massachusetts and uh they're having real problems because they have so many uh police layoffs	3143	A
and uh personally i don't live in a real bad section of town but uh just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car and there's a lot of crime within a few miles of me	3143	A
how about you	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
yeah i uh	3143	A
yeah i recently moved here and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town and uh my husband was was what he his concerns were well not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just	3143	A
be an innocent bystander just to be in that location and i thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way	3143	A
but	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
yeah that exactly-	3143	A
exactly what happened down here	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime and it doesn't seem like anything is working	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
but in in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
that's true maybe the punishment should be more severe	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
i know it	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
yeah	3143	A
exactly- exactly- exactly because they get involved in things so young that they don't really realize what they're involved in	3143	A
and uh some people prey on that you know they'll take uh kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen	3143	A
and uh get them involved in things because	3143	A
uh well i don't know i was watching on a movie on TV i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything	3143	A
so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
i think it would concern me even more if i had children which i don't but if i had children i wouldn't know where to raise them to protect them	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
it's true they uh and they they talk about too the gangs	3143	A
spreading you know like everybody thinks of them only in LA and New York but they spread out	3143	A
to cover more area and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in Texas do they	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
	3143	A
that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group and i think that a lot of people that sort of control them	3143	A
control what they're doing are older you know business you know trying to control whatever you know	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
it's true and the weapons my God the weapons that people have are some people are more- seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them	3143	A
	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
that's the other thing uh is	3143	A
	3143	A
it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
i	3143	A
uh	3143	A
yeah i just read an article yesterday um where this what used to be a nice town in this area	3143	A
they had a lot of budget cutbacks	3143	A
Massachusetts is broke right now and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well	3143	A
and so it's like	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
this is a depressing conversation though	3143	A
<silence>	3143	A
okay i hope things look up	3143	A
	3143	A
 bye-bye	3143	A
	3143	A
	3198	B
i'll let you go ahead and start yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
 you know i think that's changed just in the last generation just in the last little while because i know my father-in-law doesn't do that much of that	3198	B
kind of stuff but my husband is wonderful	3198	B
	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
 yeah yeah there still some that aren't cooperating but	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
they're not accepting that anymore yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah well i feel like um	3198	B
 to an extent that is really important you know that that um it is important for women who need to work uh or are in a position that they want to	3198	B
that they can do that um but i also think it is important for them to be with the children	3198	B
i- i think there there are some things that women just	3198	B
are designed to do better than men and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women i don't think it should ever be totally equal	3198	B
you know that's not uh we're not made like that that's right	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
hm	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that	3198	B
and for some it's not a problem but there's more and more it's difficult for a family to make a living on one	3198	B
income it can be done but you make sacrifices you know and and it's um	3198	B
<silence>	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
 -okay	3198	A
did you want me to go ahead	3198	A
okay well one thing i- i- i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality	3198	A
uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did um	3198	A
it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids versus um the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which uh they did everything they went to work and they took care of the family so	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
exactly	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
exactly yeah	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
yeah that's the way my husband is too i mean it it doesn't uh doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes it doesn't bother him- him at all to do the laundry versus uh men from	3198	A
way back there is that well if you did that you were henpecked or whatever but	3198	A
men are starting	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
yeah those are very few i think those men don't last very long in relationships because they think women know what they want	3198	A
right exactly and it's it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then	3198	A
kind of realize hey there's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all so it's it's kind of a	3198	A
a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households and i think that's even gonna get better	3198	A
even you know even more so i think it's just gonna be where men will do as much cleaning as women do	3198	A
and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this it will be	3198	A
uh hopefully for my daughter who i instill into it doesn't matter if you wanna drive a truck honey or if it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse it doesn't matter if you want to be	3198	A
uh the President or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor it doesn't matter it's what you want to be so i have always instilled into her and i think	3198	A
mothers um are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey	3198	A
you don't have to stay with nursing you don't have to be a secretary you don't have to be you can be whatever you want to be and whether it be a welder a trucker or whatever	3198	A
as long as you uh go to school for it and get the education so	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
if they want to right	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
i do too you know there's a certain part of me	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
uh-huh	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
well emotionally i think uh women do a little bit uh i- i think that's the gap is coming closer as um	3198	A
what i've learned in uh just just	3198	A
being out there it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings and they get together and they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didn't have with their fathers	3198	A
are expressing more emotions learning what emotions are it may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves um	3198	A
i- i know of some mothers that uh i guess i'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more um	3198	A
low keyed more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised you know to develop whatever skills that they have and some of the men are developing uh	3198	A
very good too so it may come down to where it's	3198	A
it's individual basis where everybody's treated as an individual and not by	3198	A
sex if you wanna stay home and take care of the kids honey that's fine i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
on one income um-hum	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
yeah that	3198	A
<silence>	3198	A
kind of like what uh my husband and myself are doing right now my daughter's three even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with she's an only child i don't know if you've only got one	3198	A
<silence>	3172	A
the budget seems to be	3172	A
oh on a number of people's minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didn't spend money here and there i hear them_1 talk about uh cutting	3172	A
what they call aid to some foreign countries and people don't understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and	3172	A
and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh you- start giving a country uh	3172	A
x amount of dollars for so many years and their whole economy and their whole	3172	A
uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever	3172	A
you wish you know you would say well you're not acting right we're gonna withhold it or you're not doing this that or the other or we want our base here or we want whatever	3172	A
and the government's been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and i'm not sure if the general public uh	3172	A
thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little	3172	A
far fetched and not necessarily for the common good	3172	A
uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few	3172	A
and usually those who are um	3172	A
rich anyway or have enough- have enough money to attend those kind of functions	3172	A
so it's that's a a controversy of course there's only a hundred and seventy million going to the NEA but a hundred and seventy million's	3172	A
a bit and it's something so	3172	A
what would you do or cut or change in the budget	3172	A
<silence>	3172	A
um-hum	3172	A
<silence>	3172	A
right	3172	A
<silence>	3172	A
um-hum	3172	A
<silence>	3172	A
um-hum	3172	A
<silence>	3172	A
	3172	A
<silence>	3172	A
most of the the national or the federal dollars that go toward any project	3172	A
uh people tend to want accountability but they don't want the so-called bigger government so they they wanna have fewer government employee	3172	A
	3172	B
<silence>	3172	B
well	3172	B
	3172	B
um i agree with you on the international aid and um	3172	B
i don't think a lot of people realize too on we can't live isolated our world is such an international economy now and um	3172	B
 uh especially with the problems in Eastern Europe and Russia	3172	B
uh	3172	B
i know a lot of people feel that we've given so much aid and we have so many economic problems and and i agree that we do but um it's also in our country's interest um	3172	B
to have a balanced world economy um sometimes it does seem like we're the ones doing all the giving um and i have to admit sometimes i have wondered if uh	3172	B
we run into problems which is is certainly a possibility if anyone would come to lend us a hand but um	3172	B
	3172	B
i do think uh	3172	B
 this is a hard area i'm there's some areas that i feel uh	3172	B
need a lot of work um and improvement and education comes to mind i know they are working on trimming defense um	3172	B
<silence>	3172	B
this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that we're in	3172	B
but unless they start working on it um	3172	B
it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable	3172	B
<silence>	3172	B
but i'm not sure exactly what practical	3172	B
uh steps	3172	B
uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um	3172	B
i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits	3172	B
the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the	3172	B
federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think that's our future if we	3172	B
um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um	3172	B
some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um	3172	B
<silence>	3172	B
it's that's an area i would not want cut	3172	B
there are a lot of areas i think that money could be better spent i think sometimes the money they spend on studies to decide on things is way out of proportion and and of course everyone's heard the stories of the	3172	B
several thousand dollar hammer and um you know somewhere along the line um	3172	B
there've been some	3172	B
<silence>	3172	B
gross errors	3172	B
<silence>	3172	B
<silence>	3125	A
well Vic you said your professional your favorite professional football team was the- was the Cowboys	3125	A
well you know i i could uh pick the uh Chicago team	3125	A
yeah i got a lot of northern neighbors here	3125	A
and uh they really uh pull for the Chicago what are the what are the Chicago team called the Bears yeah right	3125	A
Chicago- Chicago-	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
right	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
right well there's a lot of good teams out there in the professional world and uh course we hope also that the Cowboys do good i know i do and it's your favorite team so why don't you tell me about them	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
uh-huh what's his name	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
Harper um-hum	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
um-hum	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
i'll be darned	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
well is he a fragile uh football player you know they had an end or a a wingback or something like that that would go down the field and and uh he did real good for the Cowboys and every time he turned around he was getting hurt	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
i see	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
what's the coach's name Johnson	3125	A
Jimmy you think he can do better this year than he did last year	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
yeah	3125	A
but what about his players uh and their reactions to him and his uh kind of unorthodox professional football type uh coaching	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
yeah right	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
uh-huh	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
uh-huh	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
and Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach	3125	A
yeah uh-huh and what about the quarterback do you think he is uh going to stick in there and not wind up there with a concussion	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
 yeah	3125	A
that's true	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
uh-huh	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
well really- in reality uh they are my favorite team uh uh and have been you know back since the glory days or before the glory days	3125	A
they used to practice you know right over here uh on uh six thirty five and Coit right in that area	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
yeah right uh-huh	3125	A
and uh it was a dingy little old field uh uh that uh you- you would have thought maybe a a high school would have played on and it's all surrounded you know by apartments and businesses and everything i was shocked when i saw it	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where the former coach you know uh stood up in there in there and	3125	A
but i guess uh you know it doesn't take a lot of uh fancy things to make a good football team	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
since they did uh they were America's team you know back then	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
and and i don't think they are now though looks like somebody else laid claim to that	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
uh i've been to several games uh in my lifetime however i prefer to watch the uh watch the game uh via the TV tube	3125	A
yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group	3125	A
or a stands- a fan stands up or i'm looking at the cheerleaders or the clowns	3125	A
and when something does happen i say what happened you know and then course uh you can see it on the on the playback out there uh but back there when i was going i don't think it was that good	3125	A
or if they had it at all you know	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
yeah uh-huh	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
uh-huh we we have a lake house see and we go out of town	3125	A
and yeah we just go down there and uh watch the game	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
yes absolutely and and uh if the team you know starts off good this year i think that uh they will be a a drawing card and perhaps they can uh uh return to their former glory days	3125	A
you know i had people uh all over the world you know that i run into uh say you know they think of one thing the Dallas Cowboys and the movie Dallas	3125	A
and so uh i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while he's unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and he's all uh he's all business	3125	A
and he got a lot he got he got rid of a lot of the cry babies uh the people that thought that had it they had it made because uh they were stars	3125	A
and he cleaned that out real good and and i'm sure he lost some good ones that shouldn't have gone but	3125	A
in his type offense he was looking for youth and for uh uh uh to rebuild a new team and i think that was the reason why he cut all the players	3125	A
and i think also that oil man that uh that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh	3125	A
is interested in making a dollar and and they've certainly gone to uh great lengths to you know to bring the team back into Texas for spring training	3125	A
and and also to build up the team to try to satisfy the people and the various factions you know uh especially back in the beginning i think he's done a great job	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
what's his name uh	3125	A
<silence>	3125	A
Jones yeah	3125	A
and uh he's an oilman and he's got a little money behind him and uh and uh so you know the they've got the stadium out there it's a	3125	A
<silence>	3125	B
that's right	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
oh you could	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
okay	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
the Bears right	3125	B
i'm not sure how they'll do this year i don't know who they'll use as quarterback	3125	B
i'm not sure they know who they'll use at quarterback yet	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well what uh i get optimistic about is just uh the relative age of the team now with all the youth that they've added	3125	B
and sort of a change in the nature of the team to the to more of the uh the the pure athlete type at all the positions	3125	B
um i like them having added a wide receiver with a nice track background that can high jump real high	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
uh Alvin Harper i think out of Tennessee because he was a think he's about six foot three and apparently can catch anything that's anywhere near him and uh	3125	B
i understand that in high school he high jumped seven feet	3125	B
when he was in high school so uh he creates a real problem for people now	3125	B
uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
getting hurt i don't think this one has any a record like that he seems to be more of a	3125	B
a a sturdy athlete	3125	B
i know they have lost a lot of their receivers to injuries in the last few years	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
yeah Jimmy	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well he did better last year than most people thought including including myself but uh	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well i guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college atmosphere to it than than certainly than his predecessor	3125	B
i really don't know how they they really react to that It probably does him well right now with with like i said the youth he has on the team	3125	B
um	3125	B
i think one thing he did this year that will probably pay some dividends is is changing the offensive	3125	B
coach that bring in a new uh offense and new offensive system that i think the so far the players are are uh responding- responding well to	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well that's the theory	3125	B
	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well i don't know whether anybody can for a whole year anymore	3125	B
but uh he is uh he's pretty sturdy but he's got to learn to get rid of it pretty quick	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
uh well is Cowboys your your favorite team as well or	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
right	3125	B
well over there at uh near Forrest i think and uh-huh	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
that's the one that	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
i think that was the place that had the looked like corrugated tin fence around it painted blue	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
right	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well i guess not but	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
yeah during that time period they sure were	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
do you go to many of	3125	B
do you go to many of the games or have you before	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well i guess i do too really	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
right	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
uh-huh	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
right that's right i think i went to more of their games when they were still operating out of uh the Cotton Bowl	3125	B
than i have since they moved to Texas Stadium	3125	B
course	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
oh that works out nicely	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
i'm hoping that they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
uh-huh	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
that's right	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
yeah he is that	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
right	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
uh-huh	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
right	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
well that's nice	3125	B
oh the uh Jones yeah Jones is his name	3125	B
<silence>	3125	B
 where is your favorite place to go	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
	3171	A
oh that's great have you ever been there	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
oh that's a perfect age for Disneyworld	3171	A
oh that's great yeah so we've been there a number of times and uh we're going next year we have a business trip every fall well we go on a lot of business trips i	3171	A
i don't work well we do we go my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if i go along	3171	A
so it's great i just kind of join up when it's something interesting and uh Disneyworld is the one for a week next year	3171	A
and it'll be at this time of the year and this year we're leaving um uh matter of fact we're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans	3171	A
have have you ever been there	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
well you know we went there once in fact we had been in Dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to New Orleans so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a	3171	A
	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
it well and- and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned	3171	A
and i'm kind of anxious for that but um yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better	3171	A
did you know that next week there's several TV shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind	3171	A
uh if- so uh well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
oh that's	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
	3171	A
and really at our point of life our children are grown and um it has just worked out really well with this um	3171	A
position he's in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going	3171	A
whether or not i decide to go along but i do do like to travel and it's um i don't mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop	3171	A
	3171	A
 that's right but if this-	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas um that i would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas um probably once every maybe year and a half	3171	A
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental	3171	A
	3171	A
uh so we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for	3171	A
just kind of a quick trip um when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas	3171	A
<silence>	3171	A
i think that's a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent	3171	A
now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the	3171	A
what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah	3171	A
and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great	3171	A
oh i- i think that's that's the way to	3171	A
	3171	B
 well we haven't traveled outside the United States that much um we usually take family type vacations we're looking forward to one in October to Disneyworld in Florida	3171	B
a have a nine year old when when both of my kids were much younger and this time we're gonna be going with just one daughter and she's nine so it ought to just be a ball	3171	B
uh-huh i think so too	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
oh wonderful so you travel a lot	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
uh-huh	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
sure	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
oh that'll be fun too yes we went years ago we haven't been lately and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
uh-huh	3171	B
yeah if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there but that can be fun	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
no i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
yes be excited about all of it	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
 well not really uh we're doing the same thing tying it in with my husband's business trip and i just save vacation for things like that and uh just travel whenever we can	3171	B
	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
how easy	3171	B
right	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
sure	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum so that's perfect what more could you ask for	3171	B
and then get to pick and choose the places	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
ah	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
uh-huh	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
right it's kind of shaky	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
that's true it really is	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum our last big trip we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and and uh	3171	B
back through Silverton and Durango and oh it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
right	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
um-hum oh there's so- too much to see really you just	3171	B
<silence>	3171	B
 um-hum	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
 that's okay	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
that's okay it it's more uh concentrated so they know where you are	3194	A
 um anyway uh i know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are um Kroger and some of the other stores too have said	3194	A
if you bring your bags back to uh to the store to recycle	3194	A
then they'll pay you a certain amount of money and that's one thing that started in the community	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
um-hum	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
um-hum yeah i know Kroger will do it and i think Albertson's does it sometimes i'm not sure	3194	A
um and and yet i know that uh	3194	A
some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the	3194	A
the uh community like through the schools or things like that	3194	A
so um that's always helpful and i know that we have- we have the the can	3194	A
the can different can banks around the city	3194	A
that you can go to and do that	3194	A
um one of the ways i don't know uh if this would be helpful it said on the	3194	A
the computer what do i think would be helpful and i don't know if it would be helpful or not but i know on Monday the the garbage men pick up like just	3194	A
um	3194	A
uh any limbs or any extra trash that you might have	3194	A
and that might be an extra day to put out uh things that might be recycled if we had a a certain	3194	A
colored can to put them_1 in or or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
uh i know getting a newspaper everyday i know i could just you know	3194	A
do that	3194	A
because i have to pick it up and it just goes out with our trash and i guess i'm not as um	3194	A
recycling minded as i should be but uh that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled	3194	A
so	3194	A
did you	3194	A
tell me	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
um-hum	3194	A
now do you have to take like labels off of those jars	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
uh-huh	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
take them_1 off yeah	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
soda both liter sodas can you do that okay	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
right right	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
i i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just um get it into different categories like that and	3194	A
i- i don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it i	3194	A
i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
okay_1	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
uh-huh	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
oh	3194	A
<silence>	3194	A
 all set actually i'm in Plano too i say Dallas area when i'm talking to people elsewhere	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
yeah	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
 they actually pay you money for that hm um Brookshires up in Allen	3194	B
uh you bring your bags back you know they uh the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them_1 in the one of the receptacles there but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that hm	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
interesting	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
right	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
right	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
yeah i think they already do that out east um they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go it's uh it's pretty bad all these years we've been	3194	B
especially in this country all the uh	3194	B
the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and uh so what i do is uh	3194	B
it's not bad you just have to have a place to keep everything but uh it you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it	3194	B
just put your paper in the same place every day and it'll start stacking up take your glass um you know pickle jars or or whatever um uh liquid jars you know and just	3194	B
rinse them_1 out a little bit and put them all in a place and uh plastics	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
 no from what i understand uh you can leave the labels on um although i rip rip them_1 off i don't i don't scrub them_1 or anything i just tear them_1 off	3194	B
throw the lids and everything out but uh put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs uh orange juice jugs things like that	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
yes those also um and then of course uh cans Coke cans whatever	3194	B
	3194	B
but uh you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up there's a lot that we throw out	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
<silence>	3194	B
 it's yeah it's not a big deal you get used to it one let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and uh	3194	B
and i said hey um i understand y'all are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them and they had told me that when they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there	3194	B
and they said well you know people come in and put anything in the receptacles and what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags Kroger or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them_1	3194	B
yeah and it's it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number like um bags from Drug Emporium have a four-	3194	B
	3163	A
okay well originally i guess women were um	3163	A
in the house cooking and uh cleaning and all that good stuff	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
oh yeah oh actually the children they they don't have as many children these days	3163	A
because they've gone out to work and they're um uh well the families of shrinking the divorce rate is up um they're	3163	A
still trying to get the pay that uh the men get	3163	A
um i guess even farther back um they uh used to not even have sports for the women	3163	A
and uh then the women starting wearing the tennis shoes and playing sports and going out to work um	3163	A
	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
oh sure	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
uh-huh	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
uh-huh	3163	A
yeah well it's kind of ironic they're also these days they're trying they're working their way back into the house	3163	A
and they're trying to have the best of both worlds	3163	A
and they're just now figuring out in the Nineties that it's not quite working	3163	A
and they can't have both	3163	A
so um i guess they'll have to make a choice	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
 right they'll just have to allocate that time	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
um	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
well i guess the men have definitely figured out that women are as smart	3163	A
 there's a considerable amount more	3163	A
 um there's a considerable more amount of doctors these days than there used to have been and of course you like you said they're more educated	3163	A
and um	3163	A
uh we've we've uh brought quite a bit to the world	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
well some women are actually leaving the husbands home with the kids	3163	A
	3163	A
and well i don't wanna talk about the husband's changing roles but they're all they're learning to cook now and to do the laundry and uh all of those good things	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
yeah it's no surprise that uh movies like Dances with Wolves have come out in the Nineties	3163	A
and their influence uh with the men	3163	A
and uh the changing of roles actually	3163	A
uh that was a very good example of women in the Nineties and	3163	A
what's a real man and a real woman you know they uh they do a little bit of both um the hard labor and uh	3163	A
you know the smart the uh all brawn and no brains on both sides	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
okay well it was nice talking to you okay thank you bye	3163	A
<silence>	3163	A
	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
taking care of children	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
well i- i was thinking too in terms of of in terms of this you know the education is so different i think women are so much better educated now than they used to be and i think that makes a big impact on what women do	3163	B
um also i was thinking the the clothing has changed so dramatically uh you know you- like when you said with sports i thought well it was so limiting because of their clothes	3163	B
they weren't allowed to to wear certain things and so then they couldn't participate- you know they couldn't participate in sports because of it so um i thought that's that's made a difference uh	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
 right	3163	B
yeah	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
well i think so or spend part of their lives doing one thing and part of their lives doing another you know it	3163	B
yeah uh because- you know because really it isn't that long a period of time that you have to be home with children uh comparatively speaking if you look look through your whole look at your whole life um	3163	B
and i do think there's real value in being in the home uh i do sort of both but um	3163	B
you know it it is it's an interesting topic i the thing that's been hard for me to believe too is that how long- how short a time it's been since the women had the vote and that's always been amazing to me	3163	B
that that's been a relatively short period of time and i think that made a major impact on women's roles uh you know from that point on	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
i	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
well and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty to thirty years how that changes even more i think the impact will be felt more and more as as better educated women come into the work force	3163	B
um and more and more women come into the work force um	3163	B
i you know it it's going to just change things drastically i think	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
that's right that's right	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
 well i think that you know that one of the things that may come out of this is to let people do what they're best at you know some people uh may men may stay home with children better than some women may and so whoever	3163	B
you know whoever does which role best i think should do it um	3163	B
if if people can compromise and do that kind of thing	3163	B
that- that takes a lot of	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
uh-huh	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
um-hum um-hum	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
yes	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
<silence>	3163	B
well i think that's all i have to say do you have anymore- nice talking to you thanks bye-bye	3163	B
	3163	B
<silence>	3137	A
well uh Cathy do you have any pets in your home	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
how nice um-hum	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
dwarf hamsters	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
how big is a dwarf hamster	3137	A
	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
my goodness where did you get those	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
uh-huh	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
well	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
 okay	3137	A
i was going to say that	3137	A
	3137	A
oh	3137	A
well right now we don't have any pets we've uh we've tried various things we you know obviously do have children	3137	A
and uh we tried a dog first and we had a a puppy a uh	3137	A
a what did they call him a Westie	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
they're small uh-huh it's a terrier and uh that didn't work out very well	3137	A
and uh for a variety of reasons but the	3137	A
the dog was just all mouth and teeth it seemed like the only way it could of show affection was by nibbling you- on things	3137	A
yeah so it it never worked out and uh	3137	A
so we we have we gave up on that and then we tried cats	3137	A
and we ended up with a	3137	A
a bad set of cats if that's possible but i'm a i'm a big fan of cats i always had cats growing up	3137	A
and uh my wife on the other hand was not a fan of cats at all but we had these two that they we knew someone that uh uh you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and	3137	A
uh so we gave it a try	3137	A
and uh they were impossible to house train	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
that's the end of that and these it was real strange and uh they were both solid white cats	3137	A
and uh one had blue eyes and the other had white- regular you know yellow eyed cats	3137	A
brothers and sisters and we had them declawed and we had them neutered and uh invested all all that money in it into it but uh we simply one of them in particular we just could not uh	3137	A
train to use we tried different types of litter changed it frequently and it was just unbelievable	3137	A
and so we finally found someone else that was willing to to to give it a try with them	3137	A
and sure enough it it worked- worked- worked for a little while and then they too couldn't seem to get them to use the litter box	3137	A
uh so they ended up finding someone else that was willing to give it a try and that's when i lost track of these two cats	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
hum	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A

right-	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
well that's great	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A

<silence>	3137	A

<silence>	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
i'll be and my sister has tried that with both hamsters gerbils and small- birds	3137	A
and it's amazing what their cat has been able to do	3137	A
i think that pretty much over time has figured out a way to get those small creatures	3137	A
eventually to get them out to get the cage down from wherever it is even if it's the top of the refrigerator	3137	A
to get that cage down and into it somehow	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
<silence>	3137	A
well i would like to we shall see i want it to be a you know indoor outdoor animal next time	3137	A
and uh	3137	A
	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
we do actually we have a a Golden Retriever a dog and we have a cat and we have we just got two um	3137	B
Russian Dwarf hamsters which dwarf hamsters lucky us huh	3137	B
real small they're maybe about oh two inches long they're real small they're real tiny they're cute they really are cute	3137	B
uh my son's baseball coach uh had two and then had multiple hamsters that he was trying to get rid of	3137	B
and so that's that's where we got them from now we've been assured they're both males and they're in two separate cages so we don't want any	3137	B
we don't want to go into the dwarf hamster business	3137	B
how about you	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh is- uh is- are they very small uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
oh uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
oh really yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
oh no kidding uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
oh	3137	B
um-hum	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
are you yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
really boy that's real unusual for cats usually you just put down a litter box and that's the end of that yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
um-hum	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
um-hum um-hum	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
really really huh huh	3137	B
oh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
really really hum	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
really yeah yeah oh that's too bad	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
sure sure sure	3137	B
yeah yeah well we were real fortunate with our pets um when my husband and i were getting married we we had both been married before and so we were blending families and we had taken this blended families course through uh	3137	B
P I S T you know they how they have the effective- parent parent training effectiveness- -effectiveness training	3137	B
and uh so we took a blended families course and Linda Hitt the person who was teaching the course said sometimes when you have children on this side and children on this side	3137	B
	3137	B
and uh so we- i had always wanted a Golden Retriever i just think they're real neat dogs that that's a nice breed you know they're real calm and gentle and	3137	B
and whatnot so my husband thought well for Christmas he was going to surprise me with a puppy and he was looking around for a puppy and	3137	B
then um he saw he decided just on a whim i think i'll call the SPCA	3137	B
and he called the Dallas SPCA and he said you wouldn't happen to have a Golden Retriever would you and they said you won't believe it but we had one dropped off last night	3137	B
and he'd they said he's AKC registered he's two years old and he's going to go fast	3137	B
so we thought okay what's wrong with this dog who would give up a two year old Golden Retriever you know that's a nice dog something's got to be wrong with this dog	3137	B
nothing is wrong with it we have had him now for three years and just love him to death he is wonderful yeah he is he's a great dog he's he's	3137	B
	3137	B
he's he's great he's great we just- we think he's wonderful	3137	B
and our cat just kind of you know pays us the time of day when he's in the mood and otherwise	3137	B
we don't see him	3137	B
yeah he is he comes in and he goes out he's he kind of	3137	B
you know is just around we we don't really don't see him except for feeding time you know or when he wants when he's in the mood for a little affection	3137	B
he'll show up yeah yeah	3137	B
but so that's our family and we just you know uh everybody seems to get along real well the kids the dog and the cat so we're okay	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
the hamsters actually it's the dog that is enthralled with the hamsters because the hamsters are recent you know they were just last week	3137	B
and	3137	B
the first night we had them	3137	B
somebody knocked over the cage and we thought it was the cat we really did we blamed the cat and we thought the hamster had disappeared and had been eaten but we found him he he just he narrowly escaped with his life but he was found	3137	B
but since then we have discovered the dog sits and watches them for hours on end	3137	B
you know they'll get going in the little wheel and he'll sit there and just stare at them so i'm wondering now if it really was the cat who knocked them off the shelf it might have been it might have been the dog	3137	B
but the cat doesn't seem to be too bothered with them it's it's the dog that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters it's it's funny	3137	B
yeah yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
really	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
out really	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
	3137	B
but he doesn't seem to be bothered with them you know he's real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he's he's not too bad	3137	B
but so are you going to try again with another cat sometime	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
<silence>	3130	A
good morning	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yes we do we've got um a pickup twice a week that they come out and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it uh-huh	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
oh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
um uh my kids do put it that they they've been recycling cans for extra money so that's that's been their summer money and they're fixing to go to Disneyland so	3130	A
so yeah	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
really	3130	A
is is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they weigh it or whatever and	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
um	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah i was amazed at how many cans that we got uh because when the kids first went down i said that you know that's great and i was thinking you know maybe i'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in but	3130	A
its amazing how many cans you go through	3130	A
and how fast they accumulate	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
really	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah well well- uh we don't ever- we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard so if it mows gets mowed i do it normally and i can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it it's too heavy	3130	A
so i just mow- i just mow it and leave it and it just soaks in	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah oh i like it better doing it well one it cuts down on my mow time anyway and you zip through it quicker	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
	3130	A
probably- we probably will	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
really	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
what what makes me sick is is when they show the the dump sites	3130	A
you know and and how big they are or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river and they don't have any place to put it and it just floats in the and it's like ugh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
no	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah it it's it's convenient out here for them to do	3130	A
they pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper uh-huh	3130	A
and they will do the aluminum-	3130	A
no you just put it in the one bin and and i guess they do the sorting but um they'll do the aluminum cans too but we don't give them those the kids keep those so	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
uh-huh well we don't we don't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home to- to read it so we don't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass	3130	A
at first when it first started it it it was hard you know because you're just used to throwing everything	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
uh	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
it is	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
oh i know well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're oh no don't do that and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain and and then uh after a couple of days	3130	A
they take them all outside and i put them in a big bag anyway and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them so that's their activity thing they go out there and crush so	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
<silence>	3130	A
oh really	3130	A
	3130	B
hi good morning do you have recycling in Sachse	3130	B
do	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
oh really and it's twice a week	3130	B
really we have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up	3130	B
and now they have uh these large green containers	3130	B
and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet but they're but they're planning on doing it very soon apparently the trucks that they had	3130	B
um lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia and so that put off the program for a while but uh do you recycle	3130	B
do they uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
 oh well that's great well that's the way we started too my daughter was going to Camp Goddard um which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall	3130	B
couple of years ago and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to babysit so that's how she started she started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers	3130	B
and uh aluminum cans and plastics uh-huh uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
no the- the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans um the rest of it we just do because	3130	B
	3130	B
my husband has become hooked on recycling and so you know we don't get paid for that but that's okay you know that- it's it's not that much of a bother really you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of two liter bottles	3130	B
um and like milk cartons and things like that it's amazing how much plastic you generate	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
yeah yeah	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
yeah it really is well all that stuff and how much how much we have reduced	3130	B
our waste you know that we we're generating a week um	3130	B
i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week they were real upset but they weren't picking they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle	3130	B
you'll- you'll you know you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container and uh it's it's really amazing the other thing he does that my husband is a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings	3130	B
no he he got a little mulcher thing it's just a little attachment for the lawn mower	3130	B
and we mow once a week you know no no more often then that and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the um on the lawn	3130	B
and it's amazing it's amazing we don't collect any of that and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
yeah	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
yeah	3130	B
sure it does sure it does it really does and it	3130	B
actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings that that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing	3130	B
yeah yeah	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh that's true that's true that's true	3130	B
well i i really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it	3130	B
it's it's really not that much trouble we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage	3130	B
and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near Wal-Mart they're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble	3130	B
and uh i feel like at least we're doing something	3130	B
you know uh um i read a book one time or a magazine- a magazine article and they said something about how	3130	B
you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but it's not if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save- save thousands and thousands of trees a day	3130	B
a day just from not throwing out your newspapers and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
yes	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
yeah	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's really not necessary	3130	B
it really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so i'm excited about the recycling program in Plano i i can't wait for them to get it started	3130	B
um because that- it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked it up um	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
now what what do they pick up it's just	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
oh they do uh-huh and do you have to sort that or do you just put it all in	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
right right right right so you're doing that now you're doing the newspapers and the glass oh uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
my husband would come home and go through the trash and say	3130	B
	3130	B
once you get into the habit of it it's okay it's just it's just making it a habit that's hard	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
<silence>	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
 that's fun yeah yeah yeah oh that's a lot of fun that's a lot of fun well that's great well i'm glad to hear you're doing that	3130	B
i my sister was here recently from Connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans	3130	B
	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
um-hum	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
	3156	B
and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying yeah	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
 no i read in the paper this week where maybe i don't know if it was- was i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them_1 up is outfitted in time	3156	B
 but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that	3156	B
uh i'm not sure all what we're gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
um-hum	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
oh well	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
um-hum	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
well it'd get messy too	3156	B
i- i- i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot	3156	B
and uh which we're not in the habit of doing i was brought up uh you know long time ago that	3156	B
they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the the grocery store and you'd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they don't seem to still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but	3156	B
i guess this day and age they don't	3156	B
	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
um-hum	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
um-hum yeah and they uh people- i- i think kids don't	3156	B
 appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care they can get more somewhere else uh for a good many	3156	B
	3156	B
to care that that much about a small amount of money	3156	B
<silence>	3156	B
but now we we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety nine cents so i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before um it was just easier	3156	B
to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat	3156	B
	3156	B
 well as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer we i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't taken- oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them_1 to a	3156	B
a recycling place probably at one of the	3156	B
libraries-	3156	B
 it seems to be a a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two	3156	A
and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break	3156	A
i um wasn't raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they they tended to wanna	3156	A
grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and	3156	A
we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out and they weren't worth anything anymore	3156	A
and we it took us um	3156	A
 almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion	3156	A
of Dr Pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in	3156	A
uh at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about_1 a dollar	3156	A
 it just really wasn't worth it yeah so they they realized you know well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that wasn't uh that was a big deal but	3156	A
we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it and then um	3156	A
TI started keeping up with uh cans there so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them_1 in there	3156	A
least it gets back into the system but um as far as a habit at the house uh	3156	A
i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up	3156	A
have y'all got the individual containers yet	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
hm	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
right yeah it seemed like uh if if i recall it's been a long time they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just gonna have a bin	3156	A
and all sorts- different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed it it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly	3156	A
and that at at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well	3156	A
uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses	3156	A
um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so	3156	A
they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than	3156	A
than having a household try it but i- i don't know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
yeah yeah	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
right	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
that's true	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
right	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
yeah	3156	A
they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them_1 but	3156	A
uh they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day and	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
yeah just a little bit of begging will	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
right	3156	A
well i wonder if	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
yeah	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
right yep	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
where do you take your cans	3156	A
<silence>	3156	A
	3134	A
okay i guess we're supposed to discuss the uh school system that shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
that's really sad isn't it	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right well just recently in the paper here were articles about students um working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades	3134	A
but then the follow-up the next day was i was kind of glad to see because it it said that	3134	A
you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible	3134	A
you know and that it seemed to have more to do	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
with other factors	3134	A
you know like what are their plans after high school you know and what's their home situation you know that	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
sure	3134	A
but there still can be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still	3134	A
you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my my first impulse- impulse was	3134	A
it isn't really what's wrong with the public public schools it's what's wrong with families	3134	A
	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
and society in general	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
hm	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
well we've got um	3134	A
you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids	3134	A
and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor	3134	A
and that's just really not enough	3134	A
and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve	3134	A
help them to work through their problems while they're littler then they won't have as many problems up there	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
really	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum they they do that here	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
	3134	A
to change yeah	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
yes it certainly is	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
yeah that's right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
i'm on that um campus	3134	A
strategic planning committee for my school and um one of the	3134	A
uh you know oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
economic value	3134	A
then i think they decided to strike economic anyway	3134	A
you know the point was	3134	A
what happens when public education fails you know will then people go to private schools you know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if	3134	A
if most people are going to private schools	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
right	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
that's right that's right	3134	A
um-hum um-hum	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
and one of the Plano school district's you know goal is that they will graduate every child that	3134	A
um that is here in the ninth grade i believe it's something like that it's worded and um	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
i don't know	3134	A
right that's	3134	A
so important	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
oh gosh well that new movie that new movie out i hm really really a frightening situation i guess we're both lucky	3134	A
to be in situations and schools where we don't see that my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother is was a teacher for years and years and um	3134	A
they live in Peoria Illinois and their talking a lot about the	3134	A
you know the school situation there too so	3134	A
well	3134	A
shall we wrap it up	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
I think we have to so i'll see you when we see you	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
<silence>	3134	A
oh	3134	A
oh how exciting oh that is wonderful what an experience	3134	A
	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
no as many years as we've been involved in one i really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems they're not a lot of problems where i teach	3134	B
but from talking to people in other districts there are some major	3134	B
problems uh with dropouts um	3134	B
when i was in Minnesota last summer	3134	B
there was a teacher who said that uh on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city uh Minneapolis	3134	B
and uh they just didn't come to school and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
um-hum	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
i think so too	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
the home is the key i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um that- the main goal is making money now	3134	B
and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand so um right	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
your education	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
that's right it's what's wrong with families and if if children come to school	3134	B
yes insecure and their more- biggest concern is survival	3134	B
both at home they don't know what to expect at home they don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their	3134	B
apartment complex for example that child that was shot	3134	B
uh how can they concentrate on schooling i agree with you i think that's the main problem	3134	B
and school's now are supposed to solve	3134	B
social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security and that's overwhelming	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
no it isn't	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and	3134	B
they divided them up between three counselors but	3134	B
for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work so they started uh dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees	3134	B
through you know through all three years of middle school and i think that	3134	B
would give them more security in going to the counselor if they have a rapport with their counselor now if they don't	3134	B
i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens	3134	B
but it is frightening but-	3134	B
because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another	3134	B
than what are we going to do with them what's going to happen to them are they going to be	3134	B
able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
uh-huh	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world	3134	B
where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone	3134	B
we're the only country in the world that does	3134	B
and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing you know to work and have uh some ability they can do that	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
but you know if we can keep them in school	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
then that that helps a lot i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too	3134	B
it's scary to me	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
i	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
we are	3134	B
<silence>	3134	B
um i would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary	3134	B
okay	3134	B
all right we were in uh Austin yesterday the reason that i was in the church	3134	B
and uh	3134	B
we went to hear uh James Win ensemble concert they left this morning for uh England	3134	B
isn't that wonderful	3134	B
uh-huh and uh the university	3134	B
uh well let's see	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
	3104	A
five	3104	A
	3104	A
well any number is nice let me tell you	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
yeah it's not as fair to the children either i don't think	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
	3104	A
oh	3104	A
yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
you can tell	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
how to just entertain themselves	3104	A
yeah yeah	3104	A
it's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being	3104	A
uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh keeps you busy	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
yeah	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
	3104	A
well that's great	3104	A
	3104	A
no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
well we didn't do it right all the time with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh	3104	A
right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in uh and take what they're interested in and then then start looking for schools	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
no not necessarily	3104	A
and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Reynolds- Riddle and we talked him into going local here first	3104	A
and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that	3104	A
uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally	3104	A
and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didn't want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess	3104	A
uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion	3104	A
because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted	3104	A
and our other uh two boys they went to Clarion also and uh did very well there	3104	A
and they've all really got uh	3104	A
they've all really got really good jobs	3104	A
and uh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college	3104	A
she said i- i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody	3104	A
but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life	3104	A
because if they get an education	3104	A
and are willing to go where the jobs are	3104	A
they can make a you know a much better income	3104	A
like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state	3104	A
you know that boggles my mind	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
okay did you go to college	3104	A
you did see it it makes a difference	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
someplace else	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
that's great	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
different life styles yes yeah	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
right	3104	A
<silence>	3104	A
it's quite a bit different	3104	A
see that's the way we are we're more of a rural type of a area	3104	A
and it does make a difference	3104	A
i they say you shouldn't look at the expense of the college when you are looking	3104	A
yeah not really because they say a lot of times you -can get more help	3104	A
with a more expensive college	3104	A
and so in the long run if it's really what they want	3104	A
you know they're better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school uh we we did all we could	3104	A
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go	3104	A
<silence>	3104	B
how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army	3104	B
oh lord	3104	B
that is an army i came from a family of six	3104	B
and i have only got two and they're one	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
well i kind of decided that single single children that that	3104	B
that's not parenting that's a hobby but	3104	B
well don't tell that to all my friends	3104	B
 they're into quality time i'm just into getting through the day	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
well i- i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people's kids you know when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids	3104	B
that are usually in day care and you can spot them because_1 they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around	3104	B
yeah really	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
it's not a problem for my two they're only eighteen months apart	3104	B
they can	3104	B
they can find things to do and mess around and and	3104	B
plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
well how did you go about selecting a college then	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
how about_1 the other four other three who went	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
 yeah i was i was making more than i was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired	3104	B
yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really	3104	B
there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there	3104	B
i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit um	3104	B
my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known	3104	B
how not i'm not going to say easy but how	3104	B
much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh	3104	B
scholarship to go anyplace else i think that i	3104	B
would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was	3104	B
taken out of my element you know the the the homogeneous Midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh	3104	B
different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me	3104	B
now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could	3104	B
i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already uh but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to	3104	B
you know them getting an education they really need a a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and uh	3104	B
an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you	3104	B
it's very different	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
you shouldn't	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
oh yeah	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
<silence>	3104	B
	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
well i uh just had a Christmas Around the World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres and	3167	B
and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy it's uh	3167	B
it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon Worcester sauce	3167	B
and mix it and spread it out onto a plate and	3167	B
uh-huh	3167	B
and then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat	3167	B
mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuit crackers	3167	B
and that always goes over real well and it's real easy	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
it's one of the small bottles	3167	B
i don't think uh it-	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
well it's about eight ounces it it uh-huh	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
yeah it would probably make well it- it doesn't make quite as much as you think but yeah spread out because you you keep the cream cheese kind of thin	3167	B
one tin of the flake uh-huh and drain it real good	3167	B
um-hum	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
yes i have i used it uh last Christmas time uh what did i put it in	3167	B
i think i just served it by itself there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
right right	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
that's very true very true i had bought a cheesecake uh and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be refrozen which i felt was real nice	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
it uh was uh Lawry's i believe or Lawler's and i got it do you have a Sam's wholesale warehouse up there it's real	3167	B
yeah okay that's where i picked it up and it comes out of Chicago and they're very good cheesecakes	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
yes yes and they have and they have the little papers between them_1	3167	B
and i think they're what about nine dollars and something	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
yes yes yes	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
yes it is frozen and i thaw it and then you -can refreeze it and uh-huh it was they're very good very good and that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
is it	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
	3167	B
	3167	B
uh-huh it is	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
uh-huh	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
that's right and your mess	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
 yeah	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
yeah- right right	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
that's that's right	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
	3167	B
 correct	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
 sounds	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
right	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
well a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that we've known a long time like you they uh we all bring things and it sure makes it a whole lot easier anymore	3167	B
<silence>	3167	B
	3167	A
they suggested some sort of a recipe uh for um company for entertaining did you have anything in mind that uh you'd like to share	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
ooh	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
uh-huh	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
ooh that sounds good what	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
um-hum	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
i see	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
one tablespoon of Worcester	3167	A
	3167	A
okay	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
oh that	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
how much chili sauce did you say	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
like eight not eight ounces that would be a lot	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
is it okay this would make a lot right	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
and how much crab meat did you use	3167	A
one	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
one can of flake oh okay have you ever used the uh imitation yet	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
ooh that sounds i've tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation and then i found out i went back to the store and they said it is a fish product	3167	A
so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is you know	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
oh that's a good idea whose was that	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
uh	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
uh Sam's right right	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
oh oh that sounds good because that's great that must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant	3167	A
	3167	A
okay i i've	3167	A
right oh hey that sound	3167	A
right and it's something good to have on hand too it's frozen in the first place right so you can uh it is frozen isn't it	3167	A
and then you can refreeze	3167	A
hey that sounds great that sounds-	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
oh do you and that's my favorite and i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
	3167	A
that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve i- i said i can make it in no time it's trying to think	3167	A
and then we just uh built a new home and i have one of these kitchens that the center of the house and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking which is funny	3167	A
	3167	A
but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months we've lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven	3167	A
with all the everything through ready to serve because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
you're right and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come in you know they'll come in the kitchen and i said	3167	A
out we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for for guests you're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen	3167	A
and it- it it has worked out but at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation	3167	A
<silence>	3167	A
oh we even have a better one now we decided that we all meet we have it worked- worked	3167	A
	3192	B
well i am a tax preparer myself so i do about five hundred income taxes a year in fact i even do television and radio shows here in the	3192	B
Dallas market uh regarding income taxes make sure every one pays the right amount	3192	B
and i am convinced that uh most people try to hum-um cheat ever so slightly	3192	B
on their tax returns only because uh	3192	B
the way the IRS does things they're not gonna give you any breaks i mean they they encourage you to cheat because if you should get audited they're gonna get you for everything and and some more on top of that	3192	B
	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
that	3192	B
that's right	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
easily easily	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
yep	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
well see	3192	B
well Texas we are a community property state so we have some a little bit different rules than you have in the separate property state such as uh where you in Ohio but	3192	B
we- we do not have state income taxes yet but we see it on the horizon it hadn't hit here yet but we do have	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
yeah but how much do you pay in sales tax	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
okay we're at eight and a fourth right now	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
true	3192	B
true true	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
no	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
but are you of the fact that when you prepare your tax return now obviously if you have an error in the IRS's favor they're going to be very quick to come back to you and say hey you owe this much more tax	3192	B
but if there is an error in your favor they do not come back to you and say oh you get a refund they	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
yeah so you know if what's fair for the goose is good for the gander	3192	B
and unfortunately the IRS is saying you know we have screwed y'all so many times that's why so many tax payers are starting to cheat more and more which is a shame	3192	B
but i think the IRS has brought it on {themself} because they're not being very helpful to those who have made errors	3192	B
and i think if they would- i think if they would come back and say hey look this is wrong this is the way it should be done we're gonna give you some refunds and so forth and actually show an honest effort to be good on both sides of the fence we wanna collect as much tax we also wanna give back as much tax	3192	B
i- i think that you'd have a better feeling	3192	B
and you'd have a lot better tax returns being done	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
and yet if you went to visit five different CPA's you'd get five different answers	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
i think uh you sound like one of the type of clients i'd love to have	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
but	3192	B
<silence>	3192	B
 go ahead what do you have to say on the subject	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
and then they're gonna tax you on that for or they're gonna give you an interest on it i know somebody that it happened to	3192	A
no see believe it or not i'm one of these honest guys	3192	A
but i get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer expenses when i sat down when we were through and i sat down with our accountant and we did it	3192	A
if i'm not presently working outside of the home if i return to work	3192	A
believe it or not with our state income tax our city income tax city we live in and city we work in	3192	A
i would have lost and with social security i would have lost forty eight cents on every dollar that i earned	3192	A
	3192	A
sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would disrupt our	3192	A
travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said it's not worth it i'm not working any more	3192	A
it just isn't worth it and you get frustrated and yet i don't know what the Texas- uh the Texas rules are	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
do you pay a state income income tax	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
you don't	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
	3192	A
 uh sales tax we pay seven percent	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
you're so you're higher but you get {out-of-towners} on that then you get everyone on your state uh sales tax which is good	3192	A
as uh the income tax what's not fair is paying in the city you live in right now we're living where there is a reciprocity	3192	A
so if you do pay more in the city you're working you don't owe your city anything	3192	A
and this year well my husband's actually keeping track of all his time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the difference because_1 our city is a little bit less	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
right	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
oh absolutely- and much less they don't pay you an interest	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
right	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
well and it is now to the point that it has gotten so um	3192	A
so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and i've done it with transfers and sale of property	3192	A
but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it let's go see a CPA well	3192	A
<silence>	3192	A
that's what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment you you have excelled she said i cannot find one	3192	A
thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records	3192	A
all year long as i go one on twice a month one on	3192	A
 well that's what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it	3192	A
uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because_1 i said well i've got all everything-	3192	A
	3109	A
okay	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
all the goodies	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
an Oldsmobile had you owned Oldsmobiles before	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
and you what just the memory of that made you go to Oldsmobile again or	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
oh yeah	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
um-hum um-hum you are you still driving that car	3109	A
how old is it now	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
eighty five are you going to be looking again soon or how long do you normally keep cars for a long time or	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
was it still under warranty or	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
you put a lot of miles on a car or	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
for what almost six well six years huh	3109	A
	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
um-hum um-hum	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
well we don't we don't buy new cars that often we drive them_1 you know until they get	3109	A
maybe seven or eight years old and then	3109	A
we'll what we'll do is sell off we'll have one about seven say and one twelve or thirteen years old and we'll get rid of it and then we'll	3109	A
buy a new one and and uh i guess right now we have a	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
a seventy eight Chevy wagon and then a a four year old uh Crown Victoria that i love and	3109	A
uh-huh well my husband's my husband got to chose choose the make and then i got everything else	3109	A
he he he likes Fords and my youngest son still lives at home he's in in college but he drives an old Ford seventy seven Ford pick up	3109	A
that he loves but	3109	A
no i this was the last year they made the big Crown Victoria and before they started chopping it up and making it look ugly so i it look- i- i guess some people think it looks boxy but	3109	A
always like to to have a room in a car i'm not into compacts i like	3109	A
something you can relax in	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
right	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
well that's not that's a good choice for a child i think to start to start to drive in	3109	A
our oldest one started in a old Datsun of ours but our second one	3109	A
	3109	A
	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
not well just for safety's sake	3109	A
and i don't know i- i look at the new ones on the market now and the the bodies are so	3109	A
sleek i guess for wind resistance you know and and uh they just don't look like they're roomy inside i guess they are i haven't been looking at them to	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
oh really	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
uh-huh is it supposed to seat six	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
uh okay	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
a lot of knee room in the back or	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
um-hum	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
yeah	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
right right	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
	3109	A
well i even- even in our car i know like when my husband and my sons and sons-in-law all have long legs they're tall people and so if one of like my husband's driving then he soot scoots his seat back	3109	A
and so we can't put a we can't put a tall person with long legs behind him	3109	A
so it	3109	A
oh my word yeah you're like my son-in-law yeah	3109	A
	3109	A
fine back there but you couldn't put a a real long legged person back there comfortably	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
right well- well yeah i wonder sometimes you know we have the Dallas Mavericks here that play and they'll show them sometimes on TV and they've all got these real low sports cars	3109	A
and i	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
Corvette yeah	3109	A
well even to get out of it though i mean you're you're only a foot off the ground at the most	3109	A
and it's got to be you know you can't get your leg out and so i- i thought i always you always see them standing by it you know if they're advertising they don't ever show them getting in and out	3109	A
and i thought i that's the part i'd like to see	3109	A
	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
right well listen i never had a car that's had the swivel seats that where you can like when you're wanting to get out you just turn it to the side and then your feet are	3109	A
and and i don't even know if they i know for a while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
a neat thing to have but i- i for some reason they don't carry them and i don't know if they found they were unsafe or	3109	A
you know maybe to do that they had couldn't make them where they were just real stable	3109	A
one thing our does- our car doesn't have that i'd look for in another car is that that little	3109	A
	3109	A
so they i guess that's the year they learned that's not a good idea because it just comes right off the roof and straight down and just you know i try to put an umbrella up there but that doesn't help too much it just	3109	A
so i get the interior wet and i don't like to do that just along the side there	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
well i- i don't know we	3109	A
how many inches do you all average a year	3109	A
how many inches do you average a year	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
you just have had a lot	3109	A
is it is it uh a kind of a dirty rain you know i i've never been down in there but you always here how polluted with all the oil	3109	A
it's not	3109	A
it's not	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
well i- i didn't course	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
oh it is up here too it is everywhere but	3109	A
with all the oil right right that's where i was thinking of	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
that doesn't that doesn't affect	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
ah	3109	A
then you don't have any trouble with the water or	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
well i just	3109	A
i- i don't know i you know i just hear that when you read about Houston seems like they're course all their advertising or not advertising but news reporting is maybe an oil	3109	A
refinery blowing up or something like that you don't ever i- i need to get down that way i guess sometime when i retire	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
see what they have	3109	A
	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
hum	3109	A
hum	3109	A
yeah i that was where they had	3109	A
when the economy went bad a couple years back they had all the limousines for such good buys	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
we had one of our principals at our of a school here in Plano an elementary school went down and bought one	3109	A
	3109	A
	3109	A
it was just a	3109	A
<silence>	3109	A
well they they just said you can you know the limousine companies were going out of busy and and you could pick one up for	3109	A
for a real good buy and they had supposedly in Houston they had a lot of them_1	3109	A
so i thought well that i don't know we even debated about that at that time but decided no that wasn't the	3109	A
that wasn't the route when our kids were little we had a van which we loved for for traveling we had four kids and they just that allowed them to really move around	3109	A
	3109	B
i had uh just	3109	B
my last car i bought was a new one i ordered it from uh you know from the factory with all the little options and stuff i wanted on it	3109	B
it was a Oldsmobile	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yes i had i liked uh	3109	B

quite a car	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
uh well i looked around uh	3109	B
i think it may have had some influence i just liked uh	3109	B
this particular car it was a good buy i got it through the TI	3109	B
they had at the time the fleet purchase agreement	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
so that uh took a lot of the hassle out of it	3109	B
and uh you know i got all the things i wanted the sunroof and the luggage rack and all that	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
um-hum	3109	B
it was eighty five	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
well uh i am now i've uh	3109	B
	3109	B
although i was look like i might have to but because i had a little trouble with it i had to have a valve job and so forth done on it	3109	B
seem to be running pretty good now	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
oh no no this was just recently	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
uh yeah i do a pretty good bit i've got about ninety six thousand on this one here	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah i drive about eighteen miles out to the plant and back	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
each day i mean each way	3109	B
thirty six miles a day	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
uh-huh	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B

yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
oh yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
that was uh	3109	B
something we uh	3109	B
were interested in for our kids while they were learning how to drive was a pretty good size car although two of them_1 decided on trucks pickup trucks	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B
yeah that's	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
well that's true i mean they uh they should have a little car around them	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
plastic	3109	B
	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
well there's a lot less room in this one i have than the earlier ones i've had yeah this is supposedly a	3109	B
i guess they call it a midsize car but	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah it uh well no it's a it's got bucket seats in the front and you can fit you can fit five people in it	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
it's fair uh	3109	B
nothing	3109	B
anything like your Crown Victoria	3109	B
	3109	B
just you know you can sit in there and it's it's reasonably comfortable	3109	B
i don't sit back there very often	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah me too	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
same here six- i'm six foot four so	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
well-	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
that influences my car purchase decision too because i can't really get in a lot of these Toyotas and Hondas and stuff	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
um-hum	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B
maybe yeah well now sports cars they have a lot of room for your legs you know you kind of sit- lay	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
you get into a little more of a reclining position	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
 yeah their feet go way up under i've driven uh you know a Camaro- i mean uh	3109	B
yeah Chevy sports car Corvette and	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
you got to	3109	B
that's true	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B
the unfolding and folding act	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
no i haven't either	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
looks like a real good idea to me	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
hum	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
um-hum	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
well you all don't get as much rain near Plano as we do here i'll bet	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
sure been wet this i never seen a spring like this	3109	B
huh	3109	B
oh i don't know but we're way we must be way above average this year because_1 it's been terrible just rain rain rain	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
no we're no	3109	B
huh-uh	3109	B
it's just rain	3109	B
no it's uh i don't think it's any particularly polluted here i mean you can	3109	B
i guess if you went uh if you went over by the refineries and stuff you might	3109	B
no that doesn't	3109	B
huh-uh no we never notice that over here we live on the northwest side	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
<b_aside> hi there mister Colombian <e_aside>	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
just had a friend come back from Colombia	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
uh-huh	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
they have a	3109	B
well yeah it's not that far	3109	B
they have a they have a	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
they have a uh big you know it's a big complexes all around the ship channel over on the east east side of town southeast	3109	B
other than that you know it's a nice clean city real modern	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
uh-huh	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
um	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
yeah never heard of limousines being a good buy know we had plenty of real estate though	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
oh yeah oh i guess that's true yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
oh yeah	3109	B
<silence>	3109	B
we did	3109	B
we had	3109	B
	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
well it depends where in Dallas you are there are certainly parts of town	3111	A
i would not want to live in	3111	A
because it's a situation it is very location dependent	3111	A
and there are parts of town here where	3111	A
when they talk about the nightly gunfire	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
yeah that uh the what they call the latchkey children	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
you know the suburb i'm in is more of the upper middle class so i think our uh not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems but on the other hand	3111	A
uh we get the uh affect of the	3111	A
uh the city and	3111	A
uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes	3111	A
a small number of assaults	3111	A
uh well if we have one murder a year that's probably	3111	A
as many but then you know you go into Dallas and they are unfortunately	3111	A
uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
well uh the thing is i don't it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are	3111	A
inverse of what they should be like uh	3111	A
wherever there are more	3111	A
uh criminals there are more policemen but that's which came first	3111	A
but on the other side of it is it's it's basically the the problem is within the in the society and the society's views	3111	A
and uh well um since now i'm in my mid forties when i was in grad school	3111	A
or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought you know crime was was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the	3111	A
the drug aspect of uh	3111	A
uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts	3111	A
um	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that	3111	A
uh i even had to worry about but i think you know that	3111	A
there is a lot in the society where things have changed	3111	A
uh so it's effected all of us	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
you know in a sense i don't i'm not- i have real mixed feelings on that because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh	3111	A
uh	3111	A
it would certainly be an interesting test	3111	A
but the other side of it to me	3111	A
uh you- well the other side is that unfortunately	3111	A
some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life	3111	A
uh	3111	A
society didn't try to then save themselves from it they let this person	3111	A
who had ruined it	3111	A
uh become well die or whatever i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that	3111	A
their life expectancy was real short but now we tend to	3111	A
believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have	3111	A
you know physically ruined themselves	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
yeah and so to me that's i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them	3111	A
uh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
yeah well the- some of that and of course i'm a baby of the old school but it it bothers me from the fifties on not that i'd remember that much from the fifties but but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
and so you know in the there were the sixty four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties but nowadays there's so much on TV where	3111	A
where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing of course	3111	A
uh i work with lawyers a lot and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody	3111	A
and you know there's a million dollars you can have	3111	A
uh for mental duress or whatever	3111	A
but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in Europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that people are	3111	A
well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable	3111	A
and yeah if you're going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is	3111	A
we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds	3111	A
the punishment is	3111	A
extreme and we mean it	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
yeah	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
yeah	3111	A
but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving	3111	A
was uh misplaced for years that you know	3111	A
it was an acceptable social behavior	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
what are what does your city have for gun control if anything	3111	A
<silence>	3111	A
<silence>	3111	B
well Hal what's uh what's crime like in Dallas	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
oh yeah yeah in Baltimore we have similar	3111	B
uh i live on the outskirts of Baltimore and uh we live right outside the city	3111	B
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though i'm in graduate school uh i live here because it's close to the university but you know we have uh it it's really funny the only crime we really see	3111	B
is uh just the kids being malicious	3111	B
you know and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around that make sense	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah something like that no one's you know or or fathers are just missing you know so there's no uh	3111	B
no consistency there in the home or whatever there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong you know	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
um-hum	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah i think that's we're about the same in Baltimore though um Washington i think is uh	3111	B
close by and you know they experience a lot more i think they definitely have more problems that uh	3111	B
uh in in the area what what do you think can prevent crime	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah i think	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah i i i think i agree with you there	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh yeah i think they the drug culture definitely has uh is one of the main problems yeah our uh our mayor in uh Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should	3111	B
uh legalize drugs	3111	B
because it would eliminate the uh the violence	3111	B
and the uh the under	3111	B
uh the the market i guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it that make sense he's one of the big proponents of that he gets on national television and and says that you know so it's um	3111	B
and he was a	3111	B
uh District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor so that's a really stranger- you know it's a different viewpoint i uh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
what happens if we lose worse	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
right	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
um-hum	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
right yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah they have induced it themselves yeah that's true	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh well i think you know they did that in Alaska	3111	B
that that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana	3111	B
but i- i never i never heard results or anything like that so i never you know plus that's such a that's not a true um	3111	B
you know it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country	3111	B
you know so that but that was interesting you know i i don't crime is one of those things that's uh	3111	B
i i don't know you know the drug culture the uh	3111	B
the um	3111	B
you know i i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah that's true that's true we worked hard for everything that's very true	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
 yeah	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
right	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
yeah that i think that uh the drunk driving has just actually just caught on uh uh and i i i really uh my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school and um	3111	B
that was a very uh	3111	B
that that was an awful three years afterwards you know of recovery and the difficulties	3111	B
and uh everything we did and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago there was no his father was even the uh police chief of the town	3111	B
so there was no repercussion at all	3111	B
you know other than insurance but he was uninsured	3111	B
so uh our insurance paid for everything but it was a very difficult time and and then later this was actually funny my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it	3111	B
and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere and they came and questioned us	3111	B
you know and	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
right	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yep	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah very much so yeah that those are some important points	3111	B
yeah i that's	3111	B
those are	3111	B
<silence>	3111	B
well see Maryland is one of the most we just voted in uh gun control strong gun control here in the state of Maryland i i think	3111	B
 so it	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we	3187	B
sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore he actually died a few months after that and so	3187	B
as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he	3187	B
it was either you- know a nursing	3187	B
home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
um well the	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
see uh well we	3187	B
he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list	3187	B
right we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into	3187	B
or we no actually no it was even Mennonite related i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly	3187	B
the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in	3187	B
uh what do you think	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
um-hum	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
yeah	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
yeah yeah that's important i'd say	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
okay	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
yeah	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
right so that	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
right and that becomes difficult then	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
um-hum yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life	3187	B
but he was essentially too proud and too	3187	B
independent so that even though his heart was	3187	B
getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he	3187	B
lived in	3187	B
his own house as long as he could though he was living alone	3187	B
had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the uh top without a great deal of pain	3187	B
and this eventually	3187	B
things just went too far and he	3187	B
he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
right well that's	3187	B
yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to	3187	B
help decide what's the right thing	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
and	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
um-hum	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
yep	3187	B
<silence>	3187	B
	3187	B
 how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
uh-huh	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
right	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
oh my	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
yeah so the convenience	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
right	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
my grandmother lived with us um until August um and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia	3187	A
and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away	3187	A
so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one	3187	A
that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so	3187	A
yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room	3187	A
so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but	3187	A
when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and i've got little children here who needed me here	3187	A
um she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day	3187	A
so	3187	A
she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
uh-huh	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
oh	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
yes	3187	A
well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them_1 make decisions it sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now	3187	A
 so	3187	A
<silence>	3187	A
well we enjoyed having her here but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her	3187	A
and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so	3187	A
it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because_1 she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair	3187	A
so i think she'll adjust	3187	A
	3177	A
does tend to get talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how they're collected	3177	A
is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does	3177	A
enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are	3177	A
uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
well i think	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right	3177	A
i	3177	A
no not uh not near to the extent that it was	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
right	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good incentive- good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of	3177	A
uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way	3177	A
people	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
well	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
right but couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there	3177	A
and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
and then some	3177	A
so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing	3177	A
uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year you'd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
doing away with everything except for yeah all forms- all forms of it including	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent	3177	A
yeah so if you took the money out of one	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage	3177	A
if if	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money	3177	A
you know pays taxes or not but he's going to have to pay that percentage see what i'm saying	3177	A
well when a guy comes in to you know he's got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries	3177	A
he pays fifteen percent tax let's say	3177	A
and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax	3177	A
so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it	3177	A
and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased	3177	A
because_1 the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him	3177	A
whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
see so i'm saying there's	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
right right	3177	A
so you you tax	3177	A
yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
yeah it it does seem	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they	3177	A
they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them_1 anymore	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
so	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
that's true that's true not being an economy major i guess they'd never ask me anyway	3177	A
	3177	A
oh	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
right	3177	A
<silence>	3177	A
	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
but we don't have that anymore do we	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
i didn't think so they've even cut you know who can have an IRA	3177	B
that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now they've cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
but they already tax us i mean where we live it's eight almost eight and a half percent tax	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
oh and then some and then some	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
are you talking about doing away with income tax	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
i don't think	3177	B
well we're already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i don't think that would generate enough money	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
oh i see what you're saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um	3177	B
off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
well if they're not reporting the income now they're still not paying it so what's the point	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
no	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
um-hum	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
right	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
right	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
right	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
oh i see what you're saying but if we had to have an income tax which they're never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay	3177	B
what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPA's and	3177	B
H&R Blocks would be out of of a job but uh	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
yeah	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
i never have understood why they don't do that	3177	B
	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
no no	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
 i don't know i- i guess there's never a an answer nobody ever asks	3177	B
	3177	B
<silence>	3177	B
 they don't ask me at all	3177	B
i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because_1 some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they don't pay anything	3177	B
and i question their i- i- i just think that they've made it almost a joke	3177	B
all the deductions in the the way you can send-	3177	B
 i'm Doug	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
from Pennsylvania	3197	A
yeah okay so anyway now we're talking about drug testing an all that and you ready okay so what do you think about it	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
right- right i agree with you basically so might be a boring conversation but um but anyway i agree that	3197	A
um only when there's any question of safety does the employer have a right because otherwise i feel that	3197	A
the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance whether you're able to do the job up to par and	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
that and if that can be done it shouldn't matter whatever the employee might do in his private life	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
 okay	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
yeah	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
yeah that	3197	A
 well probably at least on the average	3197	A
uh-huh	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
yeah	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
um-hum	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
right certainly and certainly in any case people who drink alcohol a lot are probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs don't include that	3197	A
they're really interested in looking for illegal drugs it seems to be more for the purpose of law enforcement than for	3197	A
the purpose of the employer's best interest for the job	3197	A
yeah um	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
	3197	A
well we're supposed	3197	A
uh that's Miles Davis yeah	3197	A
uh right exactly it's on the radio	3197	A
um so	3197	A
anyway	3197	A
right	3197	A
<silence>	3197	A
okay	3197	A
yeah i guess not and i think we've said about what we have to say sure thing bye bye	3197	A
	3197	A
 hi how you doing Doug my name's Brad where- where you from	3197	B
oh okay i'm from New York	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
right right	3197	B
yep okay	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
oh i definitely i- i think it shouldn't be if it may be the only exception is when there's public safety involved you know bus drivers uh train train motormen stuff like that you know	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
right	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
	3197	B
uh you know but i- i- i think that uh i mean people think that they have an interest in in finding things like this out about their employers because it's	3197	B
probably and and maybe it's true that that if if you if you tested people and if they were drug users	3197	B
probably i mean i might even agree with you that they're probably gonna to be less productive employees um i'm not sure about that but i would say that that that may be that might be a good indication	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
but but you could also you might be able to tell by a person's uh you know whether they're overweight or underweight	3197	B
uh you know you might make certain value judgments about that you can make value judgments probably about- about a number of different things that are clearly within the realm of someone's private ability	3197	B
you know private- you know private interest or or you know i'm trying looking for a word in other words you know maybe maybe uh heavier people uh	3197	B
tend to not be as good workers you know or maybe maybe extra uh uh ultra thin people tend to not be as good workers maybe people that smoke cigarettes aren't as good workers uh you know	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
sure	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
yeah yeah	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
that's true that's true	3197	B
so we could talk about pets that was my last subject you know	3197	B
	3197	B
what's that music in the background	3197	B
oh okay a little tribute to him or	3197	B
<silence>	3197	B
ah	3197	B
 that's a good background for this conversation all right well anyhow nice talking to you i- i don't think we have to stay on the whole time and we've we've agreed too much	3197	B
okay take care have a good day bye bye	3197	B
 uh what is- what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money	3195	A
<silence>	3195	A
oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it	3195	A
<silence>	3195	A
well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i- i manage	3195	A
<silence>	3195	A
no do you actually follow a budget	3195	A
<silence>	3195	A
well that's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown	3195	A
and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to	3195	A
	3195	A
and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses	3195	A
are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently	3195	A
	3195	A
and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to	3195	A
so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead	3195	A
and we do not buy used- ah new cars uh do you get into the car	3195	A
<silence>	3195	A
we do for us very much so in fact we	3195	A
are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said	3195	A
look you guys are all into car payments we haven't had car payments for so many years i love it this way	3195	A
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked	3195	A
and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it	3195	A
believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is it's the same color	3195	A
and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the same and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again	3195	A
i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five	3195	A
and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on	3195	A
this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably	3195	A
<silence>	3195	A
generally from dealers and uh it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual	3195	A
uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one	3195	A
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying	3195	A
don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us	3195	A
	3195	A
and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes	3195	A
	3195	B
well i we talk about it but i'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
um yes yeah	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
 i don't mind the spending it's just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
i see well i'm i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh	3195	B
well we pretty well do um several years we didn't and we found that we just weren't making the most of of what we had	3195	B
and so we we um set aside a certain amount each week that goes for	3195	B
things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then	3195	B
what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
uh-huh	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
 well we had new cars um always until about four years ago my husband um owned his own company and it went under and so	3195	B
we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now it's just seems	3195	B
just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car um do you think that it's wiser to buy used	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
uh-huh	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
oh no	3195	B
oh wow	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
that's right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
wow	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
do you um buy from dealers or from individuals	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
um-hum	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
right	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
	3195	B
<silence>	3195	B
	3108	B
let's see the last one we saw was Thelma and Louise	3108	B
well don't bother well oh from a woman's point of view and it was very uh	3108	B
chauvinistic as far as women go uh oh it was it was entertaining but um yeah i don't think the general audience would would go for it	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
how was that	3108	B
 that is one i've been dying to see	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh and	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
how- how long did that movie run	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
but i mean uh time wise how long was it two hour or	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh okay okay	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
 oh that always seems to happen when you rent them you know	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh and uh it	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
was it oh good	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
oh great	3108	B
oh well i'm looking forward to seeing that one that was next on our list so uh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
okay okay good deal good deal do you rent movies very often or	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
right right that's exactly right	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
better get yeah right right	3108	B
oh oh God yeah yeah and we usually have	3108	B
oh we don't get out as much as we'd like we have two children so we occasionally get out to the movies but uh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
it's it's fun it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh and what ages are they have you found trouble finding movies for them or	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
right	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
yeah yeah	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
 uh-oh uh-oh	3108	B
yeah they have been doing that we've been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see the last one they saw was Home Alone	3108	B
and uh they enjoyed that but uh i missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
yeah yeah well that's a good deal	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
okay let me think if i have rented that one Harrison Ford and how does the story line go	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
oh okay we haven't seen that one	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
oh gosh oh gosh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
i think that's the one i wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me	3108	B
so i thought i better save that one for another day	3108	B
yeah because i think he'd like that one you enjoyed that one then	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh okay well that's a good one to put on the list	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
right okay	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
uh-huh okay	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
yeah well yeah- i don't think too many of them_1 are anymore it's it's a shame but uh yeah	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
oh no oh no oh	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
oh gosh you know it- yeah we've heard about that one but we haven't seen that one either so well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies then	3108	B
 oh God	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B
right	3108	B
<silence>	3108	B

<silence>	3108	B
 that's for sure oh	3108	B
well you too Jim	3108	B
thanks for punching in and uh i hope you see a good movie soon	3108	B
okay bye-bye	3108	B
	3108	B
well what movie have you seen recently Valerie	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
oh we haven't seen that one yet	3108	A
 oh it wasn't that good hey	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
oh well the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the City Slicker	3108	A
that was excellent it was just a really	3108	A
a really funny movie at the same time it had a	3108	A
story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion	3108	A
and but it was just entertaining- all around entertaining	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge	3108	A
oh uh it's i think it's less than two hours	3108	A
i know we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever	3108	A
	3108	A
 yes but this one it was fairly long i i'm guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes maybe	3108	A
but excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby uh	3108	A
who was the oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy	3108	A
so we really enjoyed that	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
yes i think that uh i can highly recommend that movie this to see	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
uh we generally rent a couple a week uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday	3108	A
	3108	A
they get they get taken up at the store so	3108	A
we will rent two or three movies on Thursday and uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good	3108	A
most of them are a coin flip	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
yeah well	3108	A
quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends and uh we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see and	3108	A
but	3108	A
uh	3108	A
uh generally we try to stay in the at least PG range the uh	3108	A
the oldest is nine the youngest is three he doesn't really pay attention and the five year old doesn't have the attention span either but the	3108	A
the nine year old will watch anything that's on TV	3108	A
 yeah	3108	A
so	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
yeah my wife took the uh i think the kids to see that one but	3108	A
we can generally find something at the store for them to watch	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
the uh	3108	A
oh	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
we saw this movie Presumed Innocent was the one we rented uh last weekend Harrison Ford	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
it's uh he is a prosecuting attorney	3108	A
and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered	3108	A
and he's trying to find it and it's of course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her so it's and it's an extremely long movie it's over two hours long	3108	A
which uh my wife enjoy- she likes the suspense movies i enjoyed it to a degree	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
	3108	A
save that for another day	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
yeah i think you it's uh it's something i think you would enjoy yes it's	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
it it's like most suspense movies what was it was on TV recently um	3108	A
Fatal Attraction	3108	A
it's one that once you've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened so	3108	A
once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly	3108	A
at least i don't think so	3108	A
<silence>	3108	A
i don't know we've watched Weekend at Bernie's any number of times it's just slapstick comedy	3108	A
	3108	A
sit there and laugh and my one grandson and i my wife can't understand it but we like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure	3108	A
which is another funny one	3108	A
 yeah	3108	A
yeah we like to laugh	3108	A
	3108	A
oh i i have a theory i like movies for entertainment i don't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie	3108	A
	3108	A
 life's depressing enough	3108	A
	3108	A
well i've certainly enjoyed talking with you okay bye	3108	A
have- have a nice weekend okay bye	3108	A
	3108	A
<silence>	3136	B
okay i i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes i don't know how long you've been here	3136	B
but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we don't have any	3136	B
but we do have some blackberry bushes and and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them	3136	B
um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the kids- i had to the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries	3136	B
but uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot	3136	B
and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them and they're okay	3136	B
yeah um	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah uh we have some flowers that have they just are real hearty also and they're bulbs and they come up every year	3136	B
but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out	3136	B
and uh	3136	B
there a i don't know what kind of flowers they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of uh	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
no but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain	3136	B
and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um do that now as far as our grass it grows	3136	B
crazy it just keeps growing and growing	3136	B
and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it but it just is	3136	B
i don't i don't know i've lived in Utah my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green i don't know yeah	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
crappy i know we have that too	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
oh dear	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
	3136	B
no uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
had somehow gotten in yeah yeah	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
the the other problem that we have well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived	3136	B
	3136	B
uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too	3136	B
 they had no right to live but anyway	3136	B
uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them you know we just can't grow uh grass underneath there	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
um-hum	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
right	3136	B
it's a vicious cycle isn't it it's really	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
well i don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up um	3136	B
you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live	3136	B
and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
i think that's pretty much what we have decided now i have two long windows and i'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that	3136	B
so people can't see and hear too much it just	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
that's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um	3136	B
an office that my husband and i work in	3136	B
and so i i really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and that's where the front room is	3136	B
so that's not too bad but i like to look at the flowers they're pretty	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
 yeah	3136	B
but it's funny because_1 uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows	3136	B
everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
i know it is it's not my favorite thing in the world either i'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
right exactly exactly	3136	B
<silence>	3136	B
<silence>	3136	A
 yeah i do	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
oh really	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
did you plant those yourself	3136	A
oh	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
oh	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
that's nice oh i love blackberries and we we- uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i	3136	A
but i don't have any down here	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
oh i think i know what they i can't remember what the name of them is- are- are either	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
oh	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
 down here the grass	3136	A
well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and	3136	A
and i know they must think you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that	3136	A
that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees	3136	A
i know and she's eaten the bushes i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it	3136	A
and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad	3136	A
so i can't do anything back there because_1 she just she destroys it	3136	A
but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came	3136	A
i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i put- put out front and it killed those too so uh i'm i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
i yeah that that happened to us we have these	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
i know	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
oh i know ours don't	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
i know we can't either but i've got pretty- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard	3136	A
and- and they're big and they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath	3136	A
where the leaves are shading the tree but	3136	A
toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's just it's a never ending cycle	3136	A
yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
huh	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
 yeah	3136	A
really and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front	3136	A
and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch	3136	A
so there's not really much i can do about that	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
i do too that's why i look at my neighbors yard i don't have anything to look at so i look at theirs	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
yeah it it's really a pain my husband works a lot so um a lot	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
yeah i'm it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and	3136	A
and i just i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself	3136	A
whether he likes it or not	3136	A
<silence>	3136	A
oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him	3136	A
that's why i'm help having him help me now	3136	A
okay	3119	B
do you have yeah there's a recycle center in Plano isn't there	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
oh really that'd be neat	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
that i would love i wish Carrollton would do that	3119	B
well i'm i live- fortunately live live pretty- pretty close to the Wal-Mart and there's a pretty good size recycle center behind the Wal-Mart so it's convenient for me to do it but curbside would be much more convenient	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yes i know	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
oh really	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah my husband is a landscaper and so they all bought the recycled- or the mulching mowers so that they don't they don't bag anything anymore	3119	B
so it was i i know it cut down on his work load but it's also being helpful	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah it vacuums it up and back up into the air several times and chops it up so fine that	3119	B
you know it really- it really is what from what i understand helpful to the grass and then plus you don't have the big bags of of grass every time	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah yeah so	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah we have plastic- at this center we have plastic glass aluminum and newspapers	3119	B
but uh the i noticed going to work the other day there's a warehouse or paper company and they buy like your office paper that you've used	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah and so i've started that in my office but it's kind of it's not as convenient because they want you to have a certain amount before you'll take it to them_1	3119	B
and i don't really care if i get paid for it i just don't want it you know i just want it out of my office and i don't want to waste it	3119	B
but i was reading in a magazine the other day and i hadn't even thought about doing this that um a lady mainly- mainly for cost cutting reasons	3119	B
has memo- sent out a memo to everybody in her company that says if you're sending out interoffice memos it's got to be on the backside of a paper that's already been used	3119	B
yeah and i hadn't thought about that so i'm going to make everybody start doing that they think i'm nuts	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
well i know i mean i showed them_1 the brochure that the city sent out that you know explained how many if you	3119	B
recycle this many cans this much power's saved and all this stuff so i think they're beginning to get a little more aware of it but	3119	B
oh they all they laughed at me and brought me Greenpeace stickers and	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
oh	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
it really is	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
i've gotten my husband kind of trained now because_1 it's real funny because_1 i would pull a jar out and rinse it out to put in the glass and he'd throw it away	3119	B
	3119	B
but you know i don't i don't have any kids yet and that's what they kept stressing in a lot of the brochures is if your kids are going to you know be able to survive at all without having mounds of trash around them_1 everybody's got to start doing this	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
oh that's good	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
well that's neat	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
huh	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah well i'm anxious to get it little more implemented into my office i've got the aluminum cans out and i've got the	3119	B
newspapers where everybody's- everybody's pretty much aware of that because_1 they get yelled at if they throw their uh	3119	B
but now what i'm going to do with this recycled office paper is uh just get separate trash cans and	3119	B
tell them to put their trash in this one and the paper that can be recycled in that one and hopefully hopefully they'll go along with it	3119	B
so	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
so i i don't know we'll see but um that lady said she was real surprised that she did get a lot of protest at first but she said it's cut down on their office expenses a lot and	3119	B
it's just recycling so anyway we'll see	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah but i mean i guess there's only so much they can do as far as recycle- as advanced stuff now but something else that i'd really like to get into more and i haven't is	3119	B
the like the Downy softener products and stuff that you just buy the concentrate	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
i wish they'd get more into that	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah and even just the companies coming out with more things like that	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
so i don't know i- i know a lot of companies are real dedicated to it i just got a brochure from my insurance company the other day and	3119	B
the whole thing was made on recycled paper and then something i hadn't heard of is they the ink was produced with with uh soy based oils instead of	3119	B
petroleum- instead of petroleum because_1 they said it was less toxic and i had never heard of that	3119	B
but i mean they made a big deal to let everybody know that whole brochure was recycled and can be recycled again	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah it really was	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
oh yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
oh my gosh	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
wow	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
oh	3119	B
well	3119	B
one of my girlfriends recently had a baby and she goes about half and half	3119	B
she uses the cloth diapers at home but she said when you're traveling it's just almost impossible	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
so she says she feels like she's doing her part some because she's not using them_1 all the time	3119	B
but yeah that's something i kind of been thinking about because_1 we haven't had children yet and i thought oh God	3119	B
<silence>	3119	B
	3119	B
<silence>	3119	A
yes we're doing several different things um and i haven't kept up to date on what's happened lately but	3119	A
they have uh the igloos around and they have various places for different kinds of recycling	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
and uh uh i understand in the future we're supposed to uh	3119	A
begin a curbside pick up as well but that hasn't started yet	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
	3119	A
how about you	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
curbside would be wonderful i'm ready	3119	A
um they're also doing um a a recyclable bags to put the grass clippings in	3119	A
uh-huh so that they- you can't put them in plastic anymore	3119	A
and uh so that seems to be helping a little bit too	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
 that'd be great how- i am i'm not sure how a mulching mower works -does it just chop it up finely or what	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
and you don't see the clippings lying around then huh	3119	A
well now do you recycle plastic also	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
uh-huh	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
i've heard that that's um something that can be started	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh is that right	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
right	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
ooh that's a good idea	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh that's great	3119	A
 well no you've got to do that uh	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh how funny well old habits die hard don't they i mean it the whole issue of	3119	A
conservation and everything is i you know i i talk about it all the time with my kids i'm a teacher and i	3119	A
we talk about it a lot and yet um there are often times i find myself doing	3119	A
uh you- you know throwing- going ahead and throwing a way a plastic bottle instead of you know separating it and so forth i and i just forget	3119	A
so it's a it's a effort on everybody's part i think to begin to do this and keep it up	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
 yeah	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh good	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
that's right	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
that's right and my kids help a lot my son um uh tried to or helped build a	3119	A
a little recycling center for us here at the house you know put to put the cans in and uh	3119	A
papers and uh plastic and so forth so we have a little place that he built out in the garage and	3119	A
uh so until we get curbside service we cart it all over every once in a while but they're real good about it um	3119	A
they're real responsible much better than i am really about um sorting things out so	3119	A
um	3119	A
so they've done a real good job	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh good idea	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
oh that's great	3119	A
and you can put it back in your copy machine and just run it on through can't you yeah	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
uh-huh i bet	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
huh	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
well we just need to do more and more	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
right	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
more people doing that yeah	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
is that right	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
huh	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
i've never heard of that either	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
interesting	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
interesting	3119	A
well and that the other issue is disposable diapers	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
um and i i guess some companies are beginning to do some things uh to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded	3119	A
um but we did an interesting thing in my classroom um calculating the number of uh diapers that were used for my class of kids just	3119	A
in the time that they would have been the age to wear diapers and uh the kids were just astounded	3119	A
and then we calculated according- according to the number of kids in the school and that kind of thing and	3119	A
so that you know that's a real eye-opening um activity to do because you you begin to think of the	3119	A
 thousands and millions and billions of diapers that are still there oh it's that's incredible	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
that's right	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
yeah	3119	A
<silence>	3119	A
	3119	A
	3173	A
all right why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
um-hum	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
and of course it has to have air conditioning	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
does it have to be a special color	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
it sounds like something your husband would drive right	3173	A
	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
yeah well i don't think we're looking for another car right now because_1 we just bought one but when we were looking we were looking for something had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air conditioning and	3173	A
a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
yeah	3173	A
	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
um-hum would you like four doors or it doesn't really matter	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
hm yeah it it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes so	3173	A
<silence>	3173	A
 it be fun just to win one wouldn't it that would be great {alrighty} well i- i think that's all that we need to say	3173	A
all right we'll talk to you later bye bye	3173	A
	3173	B
<silence>	3173	B
i think our next car i would like something like a an economy car that gets really good mileage and um one that's really reliable i would	3173	B
i think probably not an a brand new car but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra or something like that um something my husband can	3173	B
oh absolutely air- air conditioning and a radio uh AM FM and a cassette player and um	3173	B
what else do i want	3173	B
<silence>	3173	B
um i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice you know a a navy blue or a	3173	B
<silence>	3173	B
yeah that's what it would be for is for him to drive	3173	B
back and forth to work	3173	B
<silence>	3173	B
i think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic	3173	B
<silence>	3173	B
i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that um you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed	3173	B
uh probably- well probably probably that would be a good idea	3173	B
yeah	3173	B
<silence>	3173	B
that's right so if we wanted it to take people out with it that's a good thought i	3173	B
that hadn't crossed my mind	3173	B
yes i would go for that	3173	B
<silence>	3173	B
well thank you for calling	3173	B
all right good-bye	3173	B
okay	3141	A
one very old fat cat Prissy and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house	3141	A
that's right	3141	A
she does shed a lot of fur	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
she's we've had her for a long time we used to have a Spitz that kind of got deposited on us when a cousin was getting a divorce and we were supposed to keep her temporarily for about twelve years	3141	A
usually we've had dogs or cats	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yes	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah i'm reaching that point too	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
well i'm thinking of a next time about going back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair	3141	A
and i know there are a lot of dogs that are pretty clean and don't shed so Emily wants a dog a lot of her friends have little house mops kind of like yours	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
but do you have to let him outside for all his business and all yeah	3141	A
but see that's what would be hard for us since we're not there a lot	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
i think Jay would go bananas over that though he he likes for our house to be as secure as possible	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
that can be so therapeutic though when when i really want to just crawl into a shell i think uh wouldn't it be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
 and i really i- i don't think i'm prejudiced since i've had both but i think cats are more prone to really have personalities i mean they own you rather than the other way around	3141	A
and i really do believe that i get a kick out of seeing my seventy seven year old aunt with her animals and she had a cat get killed	3141	A
	3141	A
like she always had	3141	A
and it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
growing up it was so funny because mother would always have a soft heart for strays and	3141	A
we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them_1 fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and	3141	A
i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them_1 that were going to be award winning type photos they've always been a part of my life	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
oh yeah we had a Cocker Spaniel growing up but but the cats were the things that i loved and especially with being around kittens and the babies and all	3141	A
no no dad never- never would have allowed that	3141	A
so they always just kind of showed up and came and went and had babies and we played with them we we used them_1 as dolls sometimes we'd dress them_1 up and put them_1 in carriages as much as they'd tolerate it	3141	A
so it was always fun	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
oh yeah	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
that was traumatic wasn't it yeah	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah that's exactly what happened with ours and my brother really took it	3141	A
hard because he was the one that had left the gate open so he blamed himself personally although you know there were so many things that could have been different but it was hard for him to cope with it being his fault	3141	A
so i do hate that i that's one reason i like cats and critters that can stay inside because_1 you don't face that	3141	A
-it's it's hard	3141	A
especially if you really do get attached to them_1 i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because_1 she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's going to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because_1 i think	3141	A
uh we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet	3141	A
she's at least thirteen or fourteen we don't know exactly because_1 we got her as a young kitten or a young cat and didn't know that much about her she's a neat cat i mean she owns us all the way	3141	A
but	3141	A
does require a little bit of work and housecleaning	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah yeah	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
um-hum and you have the problem when you travel too we always we board her now and that gets kind of expensive	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
where'd y'all go	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
 no i guess not it's not pet related	3141	A
oh boy yeah	3141	A
oh how neat	3141	A
but the puppy survived	3141	A
<silence>	3141	A
and you know my aunt says that they do drug them i just went bananas when she told me that that was a fact that she had shopped kennels	3141	A
and vets and that they all very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot and that just gave me the creeps because_1 i you know i hate to think they did that to anything or anybody	3141	A
but she said every vet's office and kennel if they would let it- if they	3141	A
	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
well what kind of pet do you have	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
that's right	3141	B
Prissy get's you in trouble because you can't have them there	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
and how many pets have you had	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
well you know we have a dog named Pumpkin so what we've had him	3141	B
a year and a half	3141	B
and uh it's okay i don't know i- i- i told my kids basically i would just not as i just soon not have a pet in the house but i give in	3141	B
yeah it's- it's it's hard for me i like pets a lot but i just don't like them in the house	3141	B
so i wished you know i wish we lived in an area where we had a big backyard i'd have a dog you know i'd have it outside but um i	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
do they	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
sure	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
sure	3141	B
well it is easy and like Pumpkin is real easy i mean we don't even have to walk him much or anything he	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
yeah yeah he goes out in the morning	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
well unless you got a doggy door you know like my my aunt and uncle have a doggy door and their dog just goes in and out at will	3141	B
so that that's nice	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
all sealed up	3141	B
 yeah i know that's that's the problem with it but um	3141	B
but basically dogs- our dogs worked out has worked out well and i think it's nice for the children i it's not my most favorite thing in the world but	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
right well they are loving i mean that's	3141	B
that's the thing uh you know my friend Barb i have a friend- good friend who's just moved here and she's gotten two cats and honestly she is just crazy about those cats	3141	B
and she's single lives by herself and they totally have kept her company you know i mean it is just it's really meant a lot to her to have those cats	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
um-hum	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
um-hum um-hum	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
yeah it's really you know Barb said she wishes that she had done it years ago you know that she had um	3141	B
 gotten an animal years ago because_1 she's been single a long time and you know she says it just makes a world of difference to come home and have them in the house	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
well i guess so you've had them_1 so you had them_1 just from early on then	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
now were they indoor cats or outdoor cats	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
right	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
uh-huh well now see we lived on a real busy intersection in Phoenix and we had a dog but he was killed we we couldn't it was it was not it just wasn't conducive to animals	3141	B
yeah it was it was very traumatic my sister- it was really upsetting to my little sister and and um so that- it just we didn't have many pets growing up just because_1 our house wasn't conducive to that	3141	B
and uh it just wasn't safe we didn't have a fence and our dog just got killed we'd keep him chained up but he got out and you know sure enough was hit by a car so	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
oh	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
yeah i bet	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
right	3141	B
right	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
how old is Prissy	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
um	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
um-hum um-hum	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
well uh you know it does that's just it and right now it's i do well to just take care of my children	3141	B
you know without taking care of an animal too so	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
that's right	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
that's right we just we just were on vacation and uh it was you know it was expensive plus i think you know for Pumpkin he didn't you know he didn't like it we were gone two weeks and that was hard on him to be boarded for two weeks and	3141	B
uh we can't talk about that can we we went to Gulf Gulf-	3141	B
Gulf Shores Alabama and New Orleans and so we had a really good time	3141	B
so but yeah Pumpkin was	3141	B
yes he did i always wonder i think well now how much do they remember you know like	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
oh	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
huh	3141	B
<silence>	3141	B
	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
right right	3183	A
i have been well i go quite a bit i travel about_1 forty percent of my time but my vacations my favorite spot is Las Vegas yeah	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
really i are there any particular reason you're not into gambling or	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
i see	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
oh really in France	3183	A

um-hum	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A

<silence>	3183	A
really	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
right right exactly	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
i yes everything i see that they brought back it i- i definitely agree	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
really	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
oh yes yes	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
i it's it cruises from what i understand are are really the way to go and someday- someday i will convince my or convince myself that i can handle it and i will surprise my wife and and book a cruise uh i	3183	A
much definitely prefer warmer climates than Alaska so i would probably head for the Caribbean	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
 i've used those right	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
 interesting interesting- i never i really never thought of that that's pretty good to know	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
um-hum yeah	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
yeah and this is one spot you know being in Ohio the New England states are not that far uh that is one thing that really has not interested us we do like the Virginias the Carolinas Carolina	3183	A
oh yes several times	3183	A
yeah and uh we next week we're leaving for New Orleans and i'm i i do prefer the warmer the warmer	3183	A
um-hum but uh and i loved Hawaii	3183	A
uh we had bought	3183	A
really it it's it's uh it's just beautiful i just	3183	A
i would be very happy staying in Hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isn't too far off which is something i might wanna consider but uh	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
i you know i've i've been tempted i've gotten down as far as San Antonio but i've never gone down to uh really to the coastline	3183	A
yeah so	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
uh-huh	3183	A
i love it yes i that	3183	A
<silence>	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
yes it is and you have to do that uh people that go and they only go to one area you have to see it all	3183	A
yes very good well it's nice talking to you okay um-hum bye-bye	3183	A
	3183	A
 well we're gonna be talking about vacations i guess huh where have you been recently	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
Las Vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting man- i've been there one time and i'll be honest i did not enjoy it no no	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
i- i guess just because i'm not that type of a person i'm i'm a CPA and i i'm very conservative with my money and i just did to me that was not a vacation	3183	B
uh i now i'm a big world traveler i enjoy traveling the world i just got back from Hawaii uh this past July uh the prior year before that i'd been to uh Tokyo Disneyland	3183	B
 uh i've been i've got a trip coming up next year i'm going to the EuroDisney	3183	B
uh that's gonna be in Paris France we're going there in July	3183	B
and at the same time we're also gonna go visit Norway i've always wanted to go see the Fjords of Norway i just love have- have- have you ever been on a cruise to um Alaska	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
okay	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
well i tell you what if i possibly can uh there's a spot that i would love to encourage you to go visit	3183	B
my father same way	3183	B
he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i don't like it	3183	B
the thing that is so wonderful about the Alaskan cruise it is on what they call the inside passage	3183	B
you're not in the ocean you are in a river almost	3183	B
only- only the only thing you have are cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right side and we're talking about five hundred foot thousand foot cliffs	3183	B
absolutely gorgeous and-	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
and- and- and- and every yeah and every thirty yards here comes another uh waterfall which is nothing more than the melting snow	3183	B
that's just more glorious than the last one it is absolutely fantastic and with those cliffs the sunsets are just oh my goodness uh	3183	B
for me and my wife it was probably the most romantic one week trip i have ever ever taken	3183	B
and the food the food on we were on uh Princess Cruise Lines and the food was just out of this world	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
well if that be the case-	3183	B
i was gonna say you can go to the Caribbean but the now the problem with the Caribbean though now you've got the ocean and i've been to the Caribbean three times now you got the ocean and if you have a motion sickness problem now they have these little patches you can put behind your ear	3183	B
uh you'd wanna use those but the same time though you- you're not going to get as pleasant of a ride as you would on that Alaskan cruise	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
 uh but and and and there there are parts especially when you get close to Cuba there are the water can get very very rough	3183	B
really can but uh otherwise as far as vacation i've i've course i see i guess i like the cold weather i i've been up to New England and i thought that was fantastic	3183	B
um	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
now	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
oh have you have you been on the Blue Ridge Parkway oh wow now that's fantastic	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
see i'm a Louisiana boy so i know where you're talking about_1 there	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
yes now that was my first trip i've ever been to Hawaii yes	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
 well stay away from the Texas coastlines Texas doesn't have anything for you	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
yeah	3183	B
the the coastline yeah the coastline here is the pits uh there's- there's much better in Florida much much better uh other places Hawaii was wonderful that was great	3183	B
uh i thought Waikiki Beach was as nice of a of a beach as i ever wanna see and we went to four different islands we had a great time	3183	B
<silence>	3183	B
well tell you what i've got a i've got a phone ringing on the other line i better go answer it i've enjoyed talking to you though catch you later bye-bye	3183	B
	3183	B
okay we're on	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
so uh you're you're for no restrictions or	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
uh-huh	3114	A
yeah	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
right	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
i what kind- what what kind of means would those be	3114	A
uh-huh in other words you're saying that it would be hard uh to get rid of all of the guns	3114	A
well doesn't it doesn't doesn't London have a ban on firearms	3114	A
England	3114	A
yeah don't they carry don't their policemen over there carry these billy clubs	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
yeah	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
well it would be nice uh uh to be able to take your family out uh especially when they're dependent on you and not worry about uh having to have a gun just to protect yourself and them	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
well i have a couple of guns and uh one i always worry about somebody getting ahold of it that that you know won't know how to handle it	3114	A
and uh probably never will do me any good because_1 the bullets in one place and the firearm's in another	3114	A
and i carry one in the pickup uh and i worry about it being stolen and uh of course i'm like you i don't like to kill things	3114	A
so	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
oh yeah and and there's a lot-	3114	A
the crazies are out there in numbers	3114	A
well you know i would love to see a ban uh on firearms and i'd have to rate myself as a number one however i worry that that the that the country could ever get to that point	3114	A
and then i worry about uh the fact that uh what if there was some sort of insurrection in this country- in this country	3114	A
then uh how would we as citizens uh band together and ever put down an uprising if there were no firearms	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
i don't think we ever will	3114	A
yeah so somewhere- somewhere along the line then uh you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh oh what's the organization that uh	3114	A
that the rifle association	3114	A
the gun- the uh the gun association is is heavily for no bans whatsoever	3114	A
yeah well i think so too so i'd have to vote for uh uh maybe a five in uh and hopefully uh we could put some sort of restriction on the handling of firearms	3114	A
like like you suggested	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
okay Betty well sounds good enough to me then	3114	A
<silence>	3114	A
well same here and uh one of these days that name's gonna come back to me	3114	A
okay sweetheart bye-bye	3114	A
	3114	A
 okay well i just on on gun control i just always felt like that i think	3114	B
i don't think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that person out um	3114	B
i don't believe that most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe it's probably	3114	B
bought across the market and i don't think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say	3114	B
if a criminal- if a criminal should go happen to go into a gun store i don't think it would hurt anybody to wait a week	3114	B
to go back and pick up that gun so that they can check them out	3114	B
and if it is somebody like that then no but i really think that most of the criminals in our city who have guns do not go into a gun store and buy them i think they get them_1 from other means	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
oh i don't know like from each other you know uh	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B

<silence>	3114	B
jeez now i don't know	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
that's right nobody over there carries guns	3114	B
 i don't know if we could get away with guns completely i guess	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
that's right i agree with that i agree with that i we do not own one um	3114	B
and i don't intend to buy one and i'm not a hunter i guess those people feel a little bit different but i don't believe in hunting either so you know	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
right	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
uh-huh	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
no i don't either well it is terrible when you have to ride down the street and think somebody could just shoot at you for nothing which has been in the news a lot lately you know no apparent reason	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
right right	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
 hm	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
yeah	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
uprising	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
 you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms	3114	B
i don't either that's the problem not in this country	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
right	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
oh yes	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
yeah well i think we ought to have some	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
right i could go for that	3114	B
yeah i think that would i think that's the only way	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
well	3114	B
i've enjoyed talking to you	3114	B
<silence>	3114	B
oh me- me too okay bye-bye	3114	B
	3114	B
<silence>	3131	A
well not so much personally but my um husband has a aunt who has been like a second mother i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such	3131	A
they live down in College Station where his parents do too and they put her in a home last year she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own	3131	A
so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
uh yeah although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point	3131	A
then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car	3131	A
uh	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
well yeah when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the i mean it wasn't a very um strong stroke it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't quite herself anymore	3131	A
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself and she didn't eat she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it	3131	A
and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
 um	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
well she was almost ridiculous like she'd eat ice cream and cookies	3131	A
she'd	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
didn't one	3131	A
	3131	A
oh really well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore oh that's too much trouble that's too much trouble didn't want to cook	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
yeah	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
although they've got uh Meals On Wheels which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
no i don't think there was um i know a little bit more from a a coworker her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in	3131	A
um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but	3131	A
i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House i think out in Arlington something like that	3131	A
and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items	3131	A
they	3131	A
they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half senile-	3131	A
hum	3131	A
so they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items very limited space waste but um at least they all seem to have some	3131	A
you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean	3131	A
very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but	3131	A
yeah i don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
uh-huh	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
uh-huh	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
yeah i have a um my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently and uh she lives in Pennsylvania they live in Alabama and they're saying hey we need you to be closer and	3131	A
you have uh women like that i don't know to men it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that whole i mean they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
um	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
um	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that because i think- i think what do you have there it's a house it's walls and it's furniture but	3131	A
there's nobody there don't you want to be close to me	3131	A
i mean you know be with other people i just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
yeah	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family what does that house got attraction i never really thought of independence	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
uh	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
well when she got home who took care of her	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
ah	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
um-hum	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
um	3131	A
<silence>	3131	A
yeah my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and	3131	A
there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here	3131	A
	3131	B
we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
so it was pretty much a physical decision	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
um	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah my husband's family are reaching that point but it's it's so difficult was she in favor of it or or was she	3131	B
kind of opposed to it	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
so often i think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad i work with a lot of elderly people i'm a trust officer	3131	B
and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yes well you know that's part of the aging process that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste it really is yeah uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
and the portions people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals i do that right now and i'm not near nursing home age	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
so as a family you all just	3131	B
visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
oh yeah that's a given	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
um-hum and sometimes the the help there does it i think	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
adapt yeah	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but	3131	B
the the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better	3131	B
as far as elderly people adapting they're able to move in while they're still independent and still social and and they do group things	3131	B
and then as health or or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and	3131	B
oh i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in it's really kind of difficult	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
well and it's the first step in in actually accepting that you are failing and and aging	3131	B
you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change	3131	B
they they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision	3131	B
and that scares me the the thought of forcing somebody to do something	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
not as independence	3131	B
 yeah	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah and the quality of life really isn't there	3131	B
oh it's tough it really is	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
well they fear being dependent on somebody they they fear being a burden to to family members	3131	B
my husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation	3131	B
she'll let something slip and we'll say wait a minute and and that's it she just well i didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers	3131	B
yeah well she stayed she stayed in a temporary nursing home until she was okay	3131	B
you know it's just but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her she's down in Temple and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on	3131	B
so it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
<silence>	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yes yes	3164	B
i thought it was good as a matter of fact um i was the generation that i didn't think i'd like it	3164	B
because you know i had seen the original	3164	B
and i thought uh did you too	3164	B
well i just thought oh if i go and you know see this one i'm going to be disappointed but we thoroughly- my husband and i went and we thoroughly enjoyed it	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yes well did you know that the um	3164	B
what was it you know where they did the arrow through the	3164	B
air was supposed to be a promo	3164	B
and they had just done it to promote the movie for a TV ad and they thought it was so good that they included it in the movie itself	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yes	3164	B
yeah won several it was it was it was really good i'm impressed with Kevin Costner i really am	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yes oh he likes to show his rear he did that in um	3164	B
Dances with Wolves	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
if he doesn't keep getting a tan he'll be in trouble	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
no	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
no those i saw Terminator one and my husband went on his own to see that one	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
did it	3164	B
oh	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
oh how neat	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
 oh how interesting	3164	B
where do you oh we can't talk about where you work	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
uh	3164	B
i'm trying to think of what else i've seen	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
no no no	3164	B
well see my problem is um i teach school and so those movies that by the time the kids finish telling me about them_1 i don't go see them yep	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
uh i'm trying to think of what else i've seen um	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
oh what was the one with the guy that had amnesia the lawyer	3164	B
um oh it was so good now it's my names escape me um	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
oh gosh i might try to look through the paper and see	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
 oh let's see what we have	3164	B
it was about a doctor who had amnesia uh not doctor lawyer	3164	B
and he was a real {hustly} {bustly} kind of person	3164	B
and then he got amnesia and	3164	B
sort of slowed down and nobody was used to him he had servants at home and very very rich and	3164	B
when he went through his thing his whole personality changed	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
and i'm trying to remember the title of it	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yes it was Regarding Henry	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
okay yeah i thought- i'm pretty sure he was and he was like out for everybody's	3164	B
you know to get everybody and to swing deals and do things that were	3164	B
borderline he never did anything illegal but	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yes yes well he wouldn't defend a case because he knew they were lying	3164	B
and he was the one that set up the lie for them and	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
i don't think so because_1 we you know doctors and amnesia case too and	3164	B
then i had seen something on television	3164	B
so i think amnesia was in this year	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
what was that again	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yes	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
yeah that was released- that was called The Doctor and that was released after Regarding Henry	3164	B
but i didn't go see that because i felt like i had enough of one theme	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B
i haven't seen any of the new ones though	3164	B
<silence>	3164	B

i'll just buy the ones off the newsstand then once a month or something when there's something i'm especially interested in reading about you know	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
yeah that's probably what we should do like they they do books that way you know so uh	3106	A
okay so does your mother still take People magazine	3106	A
 cost measure huh we all have to have those every once in a while	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
right	3106	A
yeah	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
they're all so much more than they used to be years ago years ago i think people read a lot more magazines	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
but uh	3106	A
well that's true-	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
that's true	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
yeah yeah	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
uh-huh and and it's it's more as i can think more people do i think just read books	3106	A
so	3106	A
well let's see if you were going to subscribe to a magazine which one would you pick other than the ones that you are reading	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
um-hum	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
yeah	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
um-hum	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
yeah	3106	A
	3106	A
starting to save now	3106	A
<silence>	3106	A
<silence>	3106	B
hello	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
uh Marilyn it's Angela	3106	B
	3106	B
how funny	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
push one	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
uh-huh	3106	B
	3106	B
yes	3106	B
uh Soap Opera Digest is one	3106	B
and	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
uh just- two mainly	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah well it was a special thing it i think it was like a free subscription	3106	B
that you got to see if you'd like the magazine and you would renew it at the end of it i never did but	3106	B
but we take Consumer	3106	B
yeah i Consumer Digest	3106	B
now we do like that one	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
it it has all different kinds of uh tips on on	3106	B
like appliances and TV's and VCR's and cars	3106	B
just different things that you buy and and what the latest items are out and stuff it it's real informative	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
and then People magazine	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
um-hum	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah i'd forgotten	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah they're i've i've bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i'll go ahead and buy it	3106	B
because sometimes like you said not all of it is believable and if you use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and what's not	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
do	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah yeah i don't i don't buy	3106	B
i don't buy then at the store either i can't even remember the last time i bought one at the grocery store in a long time	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
right	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
what don't you like about the magazines	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah i	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
	3106	B
i don't like all the advertisements and some sometimes it seems like the magazines are full of more	3106	B
advertisements than they are anything else	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
i don't either it's just you have to turn all those pages to get finally to the story you were reading	3106	B
when it's interrupted	3106	B
but i like People magazine too	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah it is getting real expensive	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to to do it and then everybody pass it through	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
uh-huh	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
	3106	B
	3106	B
uh-huh	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah well i think we're just going to do like you said just take the ones at the newsstand that that look interesting from now on because seventy five dollars for a magazine that's just that's too much that's	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
i don't think people have time to read them anymore	3106	B
it's just usually the newspapers and	3106	B
and then they're off doing their own thing	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
weekends and stuff are pretty full and that's about the only time	3106	B
people seem to read on the weekends	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
because mainly i i'm like you i read books	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
more	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
um-hum	3106	B
<silence>	3106	B
um	3106	B
i don't know i- i'm i just i don't i'm not that interested in the magazines it you know other than like People or this Consumer Digest and the reason why we got that one was	3106	B
you know it has good informative things in there for things your gonna be buying at one time or other and you can save them and it's got like tax tips in it and stuff like that	3106	B
maybe the the other one there's one out that's that has to do with with financial things like how to save money and and what bonds and {insurancers} and stuff like that to buy that we've got we had a	3106	B
sample subscription to that one and that one was was good too it had a the article- the one that that uh was a sample one had an article- article in there about college	3106	B
saving for your children and and what to do and what not to do and how much the uh uh projected cost was going to be by the time like you know mine reached college age and stuff	3106	B
and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting	3106	B
yeah yeah like those E-bonds there's something called an E-bond that you can buy and it and it you don't have to pay taxes on it and it's for the child and then when they turn it in when it matures-	3106	B
	3152	A
well my favorite type of music is classical music and uh i i enjoy orchestral classical music and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano	3152	A
you know and that's	3152	A
those are my that's my favorite type uh probably the favorite instrument would be uh the violin	3152	A
<silence>	3152	A
yeah you know i guess i enjoy i enjoy jazz listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good	3152	A
good- good understanding of it or a good a good- good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not but but um i enjoy it and uh	3152	A
sometimes i enjoy listening to uh fiddle music we were in Colorado recently and heard this	3152	A

well actually i play i play the violin in in a string quartet that often plays at weddings	3152	A
so um i always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano	3152	A
and it makes it makes it nice it makes you know you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else	3152	A
<silence>	3152	A

great wow well my my oldest is eight and and she's we've started her on piano so uh	3152	A
but that's been it's been fun i mean it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared but it's been fun it's- it's been fun i feel like i've learned a lot about the piano i've learned a lot about playing the piano	3152	A
and uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing i sort of watch their technique too and	3152	A
and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning	3152	A
so it's been fun	3152	A
so	3152	A
<silence>	3152	A
	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
well	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B

i guess if i had to pick it would be like-	3152	B
like pop i would think	3152	B
but i like everything so it's kind of hard to choose sometimes	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
um-hum	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B

oh gosh it's like Elijah or something like that	3152	B
i keep forgetting what what she named him	3152	B
his middle name is Chris or Christopher for for her daddy but i think it's Elijah	3152	B
it starts with an E	3152	B
i can't remember	3152	B
	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
yes yeah we've heard them and liked liked it real well of course	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
um	3152	B
actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord	3152	B
i really like those in fact i had a harpsichord played at my wedding	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
which was real nice i got married uh during the Christmas season and we- we played uh old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not and it was real nice i liked that a lot	3152	B
i liked the sound of the harpsichord	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
no somebody played it	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
no no no no no just by itself just by itself	3152	B
it was real nice	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
yeah it went well it was a change you know from your traditional normal-	3152	B
normal- normal you know stuff and since it was Christmas time and and uh we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that and	3152	B
	3152	B
some of the old older ones that some i don't even i recognize the the melodies and whatnot but i didn't recognize the names	3152	B
so	3152	B
it was real nice	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
um	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
uh-huh	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
it does	3152	B
it really- really does and it it has such a different sound to it anyway it's almost i don't know the way it vibrates it's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes it it's i'd i like it	3152	B
i don't know how else to explain but we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas they're uh called Odessa it's a husband and wife team that we've known for years and	3152	B
we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff too so we've had a lot of	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant and plus my husband's real big into music too so he doesn't play anything but	3152	B
he just likes to listen and my dad	3152	B
and my kids are now well my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
yeah well my my oldest is only nine so he- he hasn't really gotten into um that yet they have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to but um	3152	B
he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet	3152	B
so i think that starts in sixth grade	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
so	3152	B
but i don't know he he shows- he the only thing he's really shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his my- my brother plays	3152	B
and um	3152	B
i- i don't i don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know it's just one of those things i'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something you know	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
yeah just a little bit	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
uh	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
really	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
<silence>	3152	B
i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or	3152	B
<silence>	3169	B
um about the only memories that i have of boating um my husband's family had a a motor boat um when we got engaged	3169	B
and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i- i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh	3169	B
driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting um	3169	B
you know they you they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the	3169	B
the laws were there and if you didn't obey them_1 uh	3169	B
you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but um i found the motor boating was real fun	3169	B
<silence>	3169	B
oh	3169	B
<silence>	3169	B
	3169	B
<silence>	3169	B
that sounds like a real challenge	3169	B
<silence>	3169	B
uh-huh	3169	B
<silence>	3169	B
hm	3169	B
 well my son	3169	B
 is uh kind of fun it's best done when you have leisure time and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now and	3169	A
i grew up in an area that uh it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had	3169	A
a variety of boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats	3169	A
um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer	3169	A
couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and	3169	A
got a new canvas sail for it and had a real huge- big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and	3169	A
we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice	3169	A
	3169	A
learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and	3169	A
um more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the storm- front blowing in and soon as the front came over	3169	A
	3169	A
it's it's a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess	3169	A
what are your memories of boating or current	3169	A
<silence>	3169	A
right	3169	A
<silence>	3169	A
it's true	3169	A
<silence>	3169	A
yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres	3169	A
and it was uh it had a lot of um	3169	A
turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go	3169	A
and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and snatched-	3169	A
pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and	3169	A
so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and	3169	A
before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up	3169	A
and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've i've uh	3169	A
done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i	3169	A
i- i know how	3169	A
you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess	3169	A
so life changes a little bit in that respect i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards i haven't	3169	A
craft- managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh	3169	A
yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of work-	3169	A
	3169	A
 i'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something	3169	A
	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
well uh it's funny when i tried to make the call the other days i thought i hadn't seen anything since Dances With Wolves but today i went to see Regarding With Henry	3144	B
it was really good we uh Jeff Warner just got out of the hospital and uh Jeff and Deanna went and	3144	B
another friend in the neighborhood and uh we all liked it we had uh both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and everyone enjoyed it and uh	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston uh	3144	B
and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought well i want to see this one too so we uh i finally it's my first summer movie	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
oh was that good	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
uh well i want to see that and City Slickers both i love comedies but that's what i was	3144	B
oh was it	3144	B
	3144	B
oh	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B

<silence>	3144	B
uh-huh	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
well i don't i don't know if you got to see Weekend um At Bernie's that was out a couple of year's ago they had a free showing at the Berkeley um United Artist	3144	B
and i don't know who was here or whether Jay just called a friend and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we'd try it you know free movie	3144	B
it was so funny and it sounds like uh what you were just describing Soapdish too i mean we just we hurt by the time we came out and the whole theater was hysterical and it's just it's just goofy i mean it's	3144	B
uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on TV i would think	3144	B
um because_1 it's it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way Soapdish was but with everyone laughing	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
well i'm glad you did that before your surgery	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B

<silence>	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
no that was one uh Jay got to see with a friend and so i i- and to try and uh	3144	B
try and find time it's hard uh	3144	B
with Jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go and	3144	B
um i'm holding out for City Slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group and because i think he he needs a comedy too um	3144	B
uh and that's what he would have liked to have seen Regarding Henry too but knew that	3144	B
uh we've we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful we're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing uh	3144	B
there's just not a time enough time to do it all and he said well realistically you know he knew he couldn't get them all in but uh Jay really liked Robin Hood um	3144	B
when the choir group went to see Backdraft and they thought that was uh	3144	B
it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know aren't real big but the the fire scenes and the drafts- you know that action part is fantastic	3144	B
but he thought Robin Hood was great it was real different then you'd expect but he- but he enjoyed it and so	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
yeah me too and yeah i really uh like him a lot which is why Dances With Wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months but it was i uh	3144	B
in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again because_1 we really wanted him to see it too	3144	B
uh	3144	B
i just thought that was terrific and i really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see	3144	B
and he's very good in Regarding Henry that's not an easy part to play i i don't think	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
yeah that's at that one won't hurt your sides um it was this the first time you got to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians	3144	B
<silence>	3144	B
uh-huh	3144	B
	3144	A
you ready okay what have you seen lately	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh i'm dying to see that	3144	A
oh	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh my goodness	3144	A
oh well i am just dying to see it i went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a babysitter and we'll all go see Regarding Henry and i said ooh i want to see it so bad	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh my well let me see was it well we went to see One Hundred And One Dalmatians last weekend and that may be	3144	A
no right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on we're going to the movies and we won't well she goes all the time but i go maybe once every couple of months	3144	A
and when i go i go see two at a time so we went to see Soapdish	3144	A
and oh hysterical we laughed so hard it was just you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard	3144	A
yeah that's the other one that we went to see that night	3144	A
and my face hurt so bad from laughing because i love Billy Crystal and course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff	3144	A
so much of that was so true and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles it was so funny both of them were great	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh they are are we just laughed so hard and like i said with City Slick i mean with Soapdish it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know just they just carried it off to the tee it was	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
no	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
how neat	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
shoot yeah	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh yeah	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
yeah i think it is i think it is	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh gosh i never laughed and people were just screaming and applauding and you know it was just hysterical	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
oh me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now i mean i'm getting around real good and i'm just still real sore and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after	3144	A
uh but see i don't have permanent work i right now i'm working with a temporary agency	3144	A
and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers because_1 you can learn all the software for free	3144	A
and so i went up to do WordPerfect because_1 that seems like that's what everybody wants	3144	A
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day and i said yeah and i went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that	3144	A
and uh i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week and	3144	A
so i went to my doctor's last Thursday and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh you're just healing really well i just can't get over this he says	3144	A
in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things if you want to play ball you can go play ball he says now i'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to and uh you know he was teasing me and	3144	A
he says yeah you'll be out there waterskiing i can just see it now	3144	A
and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks i said okay fine i i will i will whatever you call easy i'll do it you know	3144	A
but and i've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it	3144	A
and so i don't i'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when i was when i'm still sort of on the sore side	3144	A
but well what- what's your next have you seen Robin Hood yet	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
uh	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A

<silence>	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A

<silence>	3144	A
good	3144	A
<silence>	3144	A
i have- my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age and we went to the	3144	A
<silence>	3122	B
hi	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yes we well we have a cat yes named Bounce actually it's Bounce the uh about third	3122	B
yeah uh that's because when i was little i had a storybook about a cat named Bounce and	3122	B
and the cat was um gray and white in particular had to be gray and white so all the Bounces have been gray and white we also have a rabbit	3122	B
named Coco Bunny	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
right the rabbit is in a cage outdoors only year round	3122	B
	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
one rabbit	3122	B
 No that's for sure and uh that's actually all the pets we have at this time	3122	B
how about you	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um hum um-hum	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
right	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
 oh	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
oh yeah cute	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
uh-huh	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
oh boy	3122	B
did-	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
right yeah does he live indoors or outdoors- outdoor yeah that's kind of	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
ooh how nice	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
he's just in the fenced backyard and	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
well how nice	3122	B
yeah that sounds like a good situation that's about how i would like to have a dog if i had a dog	3122	B
 see our cat is also um well outdoors and in the garage	3122	B
at one time she was an indoor cat and then she started to do things in the house that i didn't appreciate	3122	B
no no no no well-	3122	B
well no because_1 she's outdoors	3122	B
so if she's outdoors i don't want her declawed	3122	B
um but she um she was kind of a feisty- feisty- feisty little character when she was little and as she has gotten older because_1 she's about seven years old	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
would she	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah well they're so independent a lot of people don't i	3122	B
that's true it could just stand there and stare at you in a strange way in fact my cat right now is just rubbing up against the the wood on the door here staring-	3122	B
with a look of don't you want	3122	B
to feed me or to pick me up and love me <b_aside> yes you sweet thing <e_aside>	3122	B
	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
 so he is sociable even though he even though he's outdoors yeah	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah my boys and um my husband have been talking recently about having a dog but we don't have a a fenced in backyard	3122	B
and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park	3122	B
and we just you know one reason we	3122	B
yeah i guess it would have to be and we	3122	B
yeah that's true	3122	B
yeah well that's right	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah yeah that's for sure	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
uh-hum um well pets	3122	B
pets really are hard on houses i mean there's just no doubt about that we've my husband was in really estate for a while and	3122	B
you know he had more problems over pets um in both rental houses and houses that people owned and other people looked at it and didn't like the way it smelled and so so that's my main	3122	B
objection	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah i mean even- even the best trained one you know is going to have problems from time to time and you just can't really get that that smell out and	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
well that's good when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it and um we did not realize that there was a problem and after we moved in it was	3122	B
so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house	3122	B
and uh when they pulled the carpeting up it was so bad on the back there were so many spots you just wouldn't believe and um they- they we had to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete slab	3122	B
and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then got- took took that well actually both	3122	B
that- um took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that and we had to stay out of the house for	3122	B
you know ten hours or something and then we came back and then they put the new carpet down there moved the furniture back to that half of the house and had- had to do it again	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah no they usually don't yeah yeah so anyway we've had that that was a very bad experience well i don't really think we're going to have any more indoor pets	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
	3122	B
 so they'd have company right well it really is fun to have two pets together um-hum yeah	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
yeah but they must really have fun together it it's cute to see several- several at a time like that	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
oh yeah	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
just the kids	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
<silence>	3122	B
	3122	A
and hello there so i guess the question is do you have any pets what do you have	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
a cat named	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
Bounce	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
Bounce the third okay	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
and the name stuck with you	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
okay	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
very good	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
a rabbit	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
and i assume that now the rabbit doesn't get out right the rabbit's in in the cage okay	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
one- now do you just have one rabbit in other words it never multiplies okay	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
well i've i've had uh i had three Cocker Spaniels uh up until about	3122	A
um four or five- i guess about four years ago and they they were all very old twelve thirteen and fourteen- fifteen and they died and but i believe the a child must have a	3122	A
pet to grow up with so on my uh kid's fourth birthday his birthday present was a Basset Hound	3122	A
which as he calls it a basket hound but that's okay yes but uh anyway so yes we have the Basset Hound who is now two years old and in fact it just had the lovely uh	3122	A
yesterday i got to take the dog to the veterinarian for his shots	3122	A
that's one of the uh to me one of the things i don't care about having a pet about	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
no he's an outdoor dog uh he's a very low maintenance dog uh we actually have a uh an automatic feeder and we have an automatic waterer so he always has plenty of water	3122	A
so i don't have to worry about going out there and like for example i'm going on this two week vacation he'll be fine	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
no one even has to look after him although we have a neighbor who's going to come over you know say hello just to keep him happy but uh	3122	A
he's in a very well fenced backyard that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and chase the kids and he likes that	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
claw	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
now has it been declawed	3122	A
it has not oh you should	3122	A
have you ever thought of having it	3122	A
okay okay	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
true true true	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
now my wife would very much like to have a cat because_1 she she grew up with a cat then uh the cat lived indoors and the whole bit i just don't care for cats i don't know what it is about it but she- i guess because	3122	A
yes they are	3122	A
you can't say come here i mean it just doesn't you know	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
hum	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
well we have a humongous uh our back what do you call it the uh living room has nothing but	3122	A
one big window after another so it's all windows and we can look out in the backyard and we're always seeing the dog and the dog you know he's	3122	A
he he knows when we're in the room because when we're in the room and just come- walking down the hall whatnot he'll come and and look at us you know we'll wave at him he'll come back to you you know yeah	3122	A
yes he is he's very- most loving dog you've ever had i can't i can't really i cannot imagine not having a dog	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
well what you have to do is have an indoor dog	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
and they can be very nice too after- after they've been trained	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
and they do require a lot of training	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
now my dog he you know we've got him trained that we could bring him inside but once we bought the new house my wife said uh-huh no no he's not coming inside this house so	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
um-hum	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
and they do get the carpet uh soiled sometimes-	3122	A
yes	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
well i tell you what i've got some uh carpet uh cleaner that uh you know it's some type of dog smell- smell away it works wonderful it really really does	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
oh	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
oh come on	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
now this is from a cat or a dog	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
okay	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
because_1 yes dogs need training but cats usually don't even need any training seem like they automatically go to their little litter box they think yeah	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
well in fact if we're getting ready to go on our vacation my little six year old now he's saying we need to buy a mother dog to take care of uh	3122	A
Copper while we're gone i said you don't buy mother dogs you buy little puppies	3122	A
and- and and my wife's saying uh-huh no	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
well we had three at one time we had three in the backyard all at one time- and they played they also humped on each other all the time but you know they	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
oh they did	3122	A
<silence>	3122	A
although i'll tell you what it really would scare me like now in the summer when this hot uh when they're playing that hard i you know it's i'm not sure if that was that good for them_1 or not	3122	A
but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a	3122	A
the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside and he is constantly chasing the kids and people walk in our neighborhood he's always and we're on the corner too so you know he has a lot of traffic going by and he	3122	A
	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
okay	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
no	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
i think it's a good idea i think everybody should should uh	3133	B
put in their time so to speak for the	3133	B
for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves i think it's uh would help everyone- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
did you oh	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
really	3133	B
yeah i think that's probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know they just they were they did things for people	3133	B
you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
yeah that's probably true	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
you know but even- even through those groups- groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
yeah i think that's probably true	3133	B
i think it's probably more true still- still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
well i live in Richardson right now which is just	3133	B
right yeah okay sure	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
gosh i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're right	3133	B
yeah but i grew up in a real small town in Florida	3133	B
i mean a real small town	3133	B
and uh i think it was just	3133	B
of course it was back in the in the fifties and i think it was real prevalent back then i i think people thought more of others than they do now you know	3133	B
as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
yeah i do to i do to	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
i'm not sure that that today's kids would go for it though i think you would have to start younger	3133	B
you know i i don't know how young you'd have to go but i think by the time they're oh early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now at least around here um	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
right	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
uh yeah i would have to start in the families first because_1 if you don't it for your for your own immediate family your sure not going to do it for anybody else	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
that's probably true that's probably true	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
oh that's great	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
well that's that's great i'm glad that there are still some areas that	3133	B
that- that get the youth involved in that sort of thing you know like i said i think it does	3133	B
even- even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
well	3133	B
	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
no i i guess that's about all okay	3133	B
<silence>	3133	B
well good talking with you	3133	B
you too okay bye	3133	B
	3133	B
<silence>	3133	A
um well i guess first of all i i could have asked that before do you have children	3133	A
no okay because_1 i i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt um what- what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
i just um	3133	A
i guess that's my	3133	A
that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and um	3133	A
i had opportunities in high school	3133	A
to work in some programs um	3133	A
and and i agree with what you said that it's	3133	A
uh it benefits the person doing it so much i don't think they realize and i uh	3133	A
	3133	A
i i think it gives you a better perspective on life and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world and and it would certainly help the country too uh	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yes	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um	3133	A
my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful and then i wondered if people were unwilling but	3133	A
but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long um	3133	A
but i do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um	3133	A
they do still have opportunities	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
but i i think that's a small uh	3133	A
number	3133	A
that could	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
no um not since um	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
not as much as i remember growing up and that was something	3133	A
uh	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
i think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
but	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yes	3133	A
yeah where uh where abouts do you live what part of the country	3133	A
oh okay we're in Plano so we're not far apart one of the calls i'd gotten before was uh down to Austin and and i know	3133	A
a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
oh	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
well and maybe um maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if we've lost some of that and it it seems in the last decade or two um	3133	A
that's true maybe that's a way	3133	A
if if young people had to do it um	3133	A
maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things i always	3133	A
thought was a wonderful part of our country um	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
is helping others	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yeah i think uh	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
i think it does help um even preschoolers you know they're um things even just starting around the home you know little ones can do a little bit to help the family	3133	A
and and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern there's always something no matter how young and then that helps	3133	A
develop that attitude um i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more you know i think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it but	3133	A
i wish ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um	3133	A
sometimes what Richardson and Plano both i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is i mean that's uh	3133	A
gosh i'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas and uh	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
it's i know our church youth group um starts with projects young but they- they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year they've done this for fourteen years now	3133	A
um and it is it's um	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there and um	3133	A
it really every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective and	3133	A
and that's just the two- two weeks during during the summer so if two weeks um could have that kind of effect i would	3133	A
think uh	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
well that's	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
yes	3133	A
<silence>	3133	A
well i guess um	3133	A
did you have anything else that	3133	A
okay well i i enjoyed talking with you	3133	A
and i hope you have a good evening thanks bye bye	3133	A
	3133	A

<silence>	3165	A
yes	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A

<silence>	3165	A
	3165	A
what type were they like sicklets and stuff like that	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
i don't know if the	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
i i had fish that were like they were called sicklets a type of family this is when i was a kid they they had um	3165	A
what are they called like oscars and uh i forgot the different names that they had but they would eat eat they would actually- they ate when they got big enough they would eat goldfish we would buy goldfish and feed them to them_1	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
yeah i i agree with that i- i- i um	3165	A
	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
and what did they do they they just took them_1 back	3165	A
yeah	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
really yeah that's	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
yeah that's what my friend used to do with his other fish he used to sell them_1 back to the store they'd buy them but uh that's cool that's	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
that's easier	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
do you do you still you still have guppies	3165	A
so you you stayed with the guppies	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
great great yeah the- fish are fun	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
no i- i used to have fish when i was a kid	3165	A
but i don't have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my parent's house i uh gave my fish to my friends and fish tank i think i gave to someone else	3165	A
um but i thought a few years ago- go and get one but i've moved around so much recently	3165	A
<silence>	3165	A
yeah they're not that easy but although it like living in New York City there's definitely no other pet that you would want i mean people- some people a lot of people have cats some people have dogs i mean i've i've even seen big big dogs in small apartments and i don't really see that	3165	A
yeah someday if i move out into the country i like it like a you know like a Labrador or something like that some you know bigger dog that could kind of run around outside and stuff	3165	A
but yeah you see these big dog- i mean i see this guy in my building with some i think it's like a golden retriever or something like that and he he's good though he takes him out all the time or her out all the time	3165	A
yeah this guy he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog so he probably gets in enough exercise	3165	A
but you know lot	3165	A
 i'm doing fine	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
what's what was your name	3165	B
oh i'm Nola and i'm in Plano Texas	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
it's Plano it's just north of Dallas	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
uh oh pets yes	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
yeah i didn't quite understand what you said i'm sorry	3165	B
we don't have uh i grew up in New Jersey but it's been a long time since i lived there	3165	B
 did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish that's it	3165	B
yeah it's uh	3165	B
uh uh neither my husband or i really wanted to take care of cats or dogs or anything like that so	3165	B
and the girls kind of wanted something we have four- uh well now we have four girls when we got the fish to start with we had two or three but um	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
for some reason i just decided to start a fish tank and set up a ten gallon fish tank and	3165	B
it started with the some uh we had a real hard time getting it established tried the goldfish and they were just filthy could not keep the tank clean um	3165	B
eventually i took them back to the store and started- started all over again and	3165	B
 i had another couple of kinds that ate each other so that bunch didn't work either	3165	B
um there were some neons and a couple of other kind i can't remember what they were	3165	B
but but they didn't get along very well whatever they were	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
huh	3165	B
well these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that but they were	3165	B
and uh they- i could see them_1 picking on each other	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
yeah anyway i finally got rid of those- those all killed each other off and i cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again and so- established and i got about half a dozen guppies from a friend	3165	B
and they just bred and bred and bred and they're uh there must've been a hundred guppies in that tank and i had- i took- i must've taken thirty or forty of them at a time back to the store two or three different times	3165	B
	3165	B
they took them_1 back and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time	3165	B
so yeah helped to buy fish food and filters	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
uh-huh	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
but- but- but uh then i i- i- i went for a while where um while i was pregnant with our new little baby we uh i- i just	3165	B
kept forgetting to clean the fish- tank and it was really dirty for a long time but those fish still lived in there and um	3165	B
finally i cleaned the tank out and most of them had disappeared um and i don't think i've got any males in there anymore so they're not multiplying anymore	3165	B
 yeah yeah i need to get a new um	3165	B
algae eater though	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
 yep there's still there's about a dozen guppies in there right now	3165	B
so but that's the only thing we've got <b_aside> yes you may i know <e_aside> sorry and and so you have fish or do you have	3165	B
but you don't have anything right now	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
yeah it's kind of a problem moving them	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
you feel sorry for them	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
uh-huh	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
you'd have to do it an awful lot though	3165	B
<silence>	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
	3160	A
well course my favorite team there is the Texas Rangers so i watch them all the time	3160	A
and who do you watch	3160	A
the Mets	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
 this isn't their best season is it	3160	A
 well the Rangers are the few games behind Minnesota but if we could win the next oh i guess we'd win have to win most all of them we could still go to the to the race to do the	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
 well i watched the two games the last two nights so	3160	A
oh is that right	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
pardon	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
 i think they're out six	3160	A
and so they have to still win almost every single game that they have to play to the end now	3160	A
or else	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
yeah yeah	3160	A
i don't know Minnesota's won a good game they're they're doing a good job this year i don't know	3160	A
they really but i'm gonna watch tonight because Nolan Ryan's gonna pitch so i always like to watch him pitch	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
yeah	3160	A
um-hum	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
well uh we just traded Buechele and i really liked him but but- he's gone now so i i guess uh Sierra i like to watch him bat	3160	A
yeah he's he's really good Franco's good except that uh he's got injuries right now his hamstring's down in the bottom of his legs he can't run very well but	3160	A
	3160	A
	3160	A
yeah well they've moved him now since he can't move that quickly since it hurts him	3160	A
they moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into that area in that runs now in between the shortstop area and he takes second base	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
um Sierra let's see yeah Sierra's into	3160	A
is he middle field or left field he's not left field he must be center field	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
do you	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
oh now what's that i don't know what that is	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
oh	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
oh	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
oh	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
yeah that's hard	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
um no not too not too much i- i guess i just don't watch them that much um	3160	A
i like to watch the Oakland A's play they have a lot of good players too but i haven't watched them for a while so i don't know how they're doing too well this season	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
um once every so often mostly Rangers games come on because that's our area but um	3160	A
	3160	A
every once in a while on a Saturday or a Sunday they'll put a another league on you know	3160	A
but it's it just depends	3160	A
how to you know how they fill the time sometimes	3160	A
 anyway i um we got	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
what	3160	A
oh is it	3160	A
oh well that's kind of fun	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
	3160	A
<silence>	3160	A
yeah uh isn't it's a fun thing i think you'll like it it's a it's a old thing to do and um	3160	A
 anyway we just uh if you get run out of things to say then you say good bye it was nice talking to you too	3160	A
and have a good day um bye-bye	3160	A
	3160	A
	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
uh the Mets but i don't do that anymore because uh they're doing lousy i don't know	3160	B
 no no	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
i think you're uh definitely an avid fan huh	3160	B
they just i gave up on the Mets around August you know	3160	B
how many games out is Texas	3160	B
how many games out are they	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
right right yeah i think Minnesota's got to get like three wins or or Texas has to lose three games or some combination of that well maybe next year	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
yeah they- they are they are	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
yeah who's who's who he used to be on the Mets a long time ago but who's who's who else is like Texas's big players that that uh	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
right Ruben- right he's supposed to be good	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
he's the shortstop though right Franco	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
right	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
and Sierra's an outfielder	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
 yeah i don't see i don't know the American League that well once in a while i watch the Yankees um but rarely and uh but this guy that i'm i work with is in this rotisserie league where they they choose	3160	B
well you choose players and you do stuff based on stats and everything like that so he's always talking to me about the American League	3160	B
like he gets points for every time uh i think he has Ruben Sierra on his team and every time he hits a home run or steals a base or gets a hit he gets a certain amount of points and then you get pitchers and stuff like that	3160	B
so he's always talking about the American League which is like i said because i watch the Mets i don't really know that much about the American League	3160	B
you're not an Astro fan	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
no they're not they they were doing well for a while but then they kind of fell off do you get all the games out there i mean you get you get to watch the A's a lot and stuff like that	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
right	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
right	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
this is my first conversation through this Texas Instruments thing	3160	B
this is the first time i've done one of these conversations yeah	3160	B
so i didn't even expect it i just i happened to have the uh i didn't even know what my um my personal identification number was i just happened to have the folder right in front of me i'm glad i brought it into work just	3160	B
<silence>	3160	B
 okay well it's nice talking to you and uh be good thank you	3160	B
okay bye-bye	3160	B
	3142	B
okay well i guess i enjoy eating out um uh here and there or	3142	B
it's it's a good change and good change from cooking and eating at home and i guess i like a variety of a variety of restaurants	3142	B
uh sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and	3142	B
and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal and sometimes	3142	B
it's i enjoy going out having a formal meal	3142	B
and uh	3142	B
sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad	3142	B
something you know	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
well a variety i i like to go sometimes without them and sometimes i sometimes it's okay to take them along so sometimes i think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches so uh	3142	B
it just you know it just varies we do a mix sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet -without little ones at the table	3142	B
so uh	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
i guess i guess actually on those those times uh we even there are times i even say oh please don't sit us next to a table with other children	3142	B
this is our night out so	3142	B
but uh anyway where do you like to eat	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
uh-huh	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
right	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
right	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh which one do you like	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh okay well it's been a long time since we've been in there but uh but it's good there's an Italian restaurant over over by the mall over by uh Plano Parkway there past- oh is it Campari's or something	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
well it's good i haven't my husband had been in there several times and we went in there actually we went in there for lunch one day and uh their pastas were great	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
you're brave	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh God	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
right	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
 oh well even though traditional it can backfire	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
uh	3142	B
well my husband's kind of the ethnic- he he's the ethnic fan so he's i don't know you know what we read we read the uh D magazine	3142	B
we we check that and uh the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there they often do ratings of restaurants so uh we've	3142	B
uh we've usually we often save those and adventured out on from there	3142	B
uh just for something that had a high rating	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
okay	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
that's	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
that's right	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh good oh good	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh oh yeah we i guess we we use the coupons too that's true that's true	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh right right	3142	B
right	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
well i think that it's just that's exactly- sometimes i think going out to eat it's it's sort of a recreation	3142	B
so uh just a just a change of pace	3142	B
from uh	3142	B
eating at home so uh anyway i guess uh as far as as far as service when we go out gosh it's nice it's nice to have somebody come and wait the table and clear the table and	3142	B
yeah and do the dishes and uh actually it's kind of nice to you know i always uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive	3142	B
so uh we've had experience with that too so	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh yeah	3142	B
	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
gosh i guess just in Plano i Plano i like to go to Souper Salads	3142	B
uh Chili's Chili's is always fine	3142	B
i guess if we go to Dallas into Dallas we like uh	3142	B
the Routh is it Routh Street Cafe	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
we	3142	B
well you would like it you'd like it especially it you're adventuresome	3142	B
it just we've we've taken people there several times and uh they have a good they have a good choice of of things that are very different sounding i guess it's whether you call it Southwestern	3142	B
but uh oh we had venison	3142	B
venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful	3142	B
and then i guess it must be seasonal and we've been back oh i guess it's in the winter season well they've never had it when we've been back so but uh well you ought to try that it's it's it's very good	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
no	3142	B
<silence>	3142	B
oh that's good yes i've been there	3142	B
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
yes	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
do you usually go out uh with the children or without them	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
 right	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
yes	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
yes	3142	A
yes	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
well i	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
no i-	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh well uh we don't have any children so uh we tend to like to try all sorts of different things and uh we're very attracted to exotic food	3142	A
and uh we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and uh sort of gourmet Mexican and uh things like that	3142	A
as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and uh Chinese and things and and things of that sort now yes of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too	3142	A
and uh we probably go out one to two times a week	3142	A
and uh	3142	A
uh we're pretty much regulars at an Italian local Italian restaurant	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
Momo's	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
i've heard about it i haven't been in there	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
that's- that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me	3142	A
i i like different kinds of food so when we go out i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican restaurant like something other than uh you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and	3142	A
fajitas now	3142	A
yes yes and once in a while things backfire i mean we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that and i'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try we'll try anything just about Ethiopian we've had Ethiopian	3142	A
and uh not in Plano of course but we really we really do enjoy going out and uh and i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
yeah i think that we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant how do you usually find a a new restaurant	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh so do we	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
right	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh we have found uh a number of restaurants either through D and the Friday paper and sometimes the the Observer which my husband usually picks up	3142	A
and also through coupons when a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons and you know when they say you know buy one get one free	3142	A
it's hard to resist so we'll go in and very often we'll find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they give they they no longer give coupons we'll we'll uh we'll stay there	3142	A
but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper- through the newspaper reviews	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
i mean it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that	3142	A
it's very expensive to go out to eat	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
so yeah that that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
yeah	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
yes	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
oh absolutely	3142	A
and do the dishes	3142	A
	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
oh yes	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
oh my- my- my sister who also lives here in Dallas uh tends to uh chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
but	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
what's your favorite restaurant	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
sure	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
you know we've never been there and that's supposed to be wonderful	3142	A
um	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
ooh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
i would probably like that one or two times in my life i've ever had venison i've loved it but you know just it's just not i don't know people who hunt so	3142	A
	3142	A
uh God that's that's supposed to be a wonderful place well- uh uh uh here in Plano	3142	A
well we tend to go to Momo's a lot- fairly often and uh	3142	A
<silence>	3142	A
sometimes we'll go you know we we also go to Chili's and uh Colter's Bar B Q and and uh	3142	A
we go to little- there is a little Thai place that's over on park that we go to my husband particularly likes that	3142	A
we go into Dallas a lot and because we're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently and uh we'll go down to uh Blue Mesa Grill for Mexican food and	3142	A
oh	3142	A
<silence>	3100	B
okay	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh not with my parents although my parents are now in their early seventies	3100	B
and uh fortunately they have to this point been very physically healthy and very self sufficient	3100	B
and they really looked after themselves and i think considered what they want done as they get older and maybe less able	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
well the it it's more that they've established- they when they retired and we're from South Dakota	3100	B
so they retired from the rural farming community into Sioux Falls which is the biggest city in the state	3100	B
and set themselves up near medical facilities and i- i can't say i can tell you what they've uh decided as to okay because i think some of that is that	3100	B
maybe you think ahead somewhat but you don't uh book those facilities yeah	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
well have they do they recognize the coming and try to make the decision themselves	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
yeah that is one of the options but uh that is so related to the family situation of the children and	3100	B
uh you know i guess not that it's happened in our case in my family because it well i have seen it in their generation it what you do is first see your parents go through it with their parents	3100	B
and i would say well at this point um you could say been through all that because i have no no grandparents left uh and it's	3100	B
you see all the different options and you see that they all can work uh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
well if they're uh that's the thing if they're physically able it is a much more pleasant more caring uh situation to be in the home of one of the children	3100	B
uh the other side of that is that if the children are no where near where the uh parents had spent their life then in a sense you you have no friends at the new place	3100	B
uh in this that you are unless that you develop new friends and uh the best thing is kind of a combination where	3100	B
uh the at least one of the children if not several are uh uh back in the area where the parents uh had spent their years and then	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
yeah	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
yes well it's it's not an easy choice because it's uh but uh it's something that we all face and we uh	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
yeah but the way society changes it makes it so that uh what was acceptable for our parents and their parents	3100	B
uh may not be as workable for us it it's certainly a problem as we as people live older of course as long as you can live a healthy life uh	3100	B
the uh the care is is not near the issue it becomes when you start having the physical problems	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
yes	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
right	3100	B
<silence>	3100	B
	3100	A
okay	3100	A
you there well have you had	3100	A
this with one of your parents yet	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
what what is do they want done that's interesting that they've already said	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
	3100	A
now my parents are seventy nine and eighty one	3100	A
and they're they're still	3100	A
taking care of themselves but	3100	A
when they were your parents age they were doing much better now it's gotten to where it's just barely and we know it's going to be probably	3100	A
anytime you know that that we're going to have to	3100	A
change them from their home or something you know	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
no my stepfather is one that's always had a horror of nursing homes and don't ever put me there now my mother on the other hand i don't think would mind you know	3100	A
uh they live in a small town uh a hundred and twenty miles northeast of Dallas and uh	3100	A
and so the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their	3100	A
advantage but uh i guess you know i don't know how long i have a brother and two stepsisters but	3100	A
we really haven't really discussed it that much either we should have by this point you know at seventy nine and eighty one but i guess we're just waiting to see what happens and then i guess we'll make a make decisions then	3100	A
and uh but my stepfather's health is is failing bad you know i don't know if he has starting of Alzheimer or	3100	A
or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery he's been going down hill you know	3100	A
and uh so anyway i uh by this time we should have probably made some decisions but we haven't so i- i can see a lot of friends	3100	A
here in the neighborhood too uh one's mother just got to where she couldn't take care of herself anymore in Florida as far as you know eating meals and	3100	A
all that kind of stuff she just wasn't doing it you know so she has come to live with her daughter in the neighborhood	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
i've almost been surprised the last three or four years with my friends in the neighborhood as many	3100	A
mothers it's always been mothers have come to live in the home but then maybe they'll have a stroke or something and and then then they'll go to the nursing home but they go to the home first	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
that would make it easier yeah if if you were but like you say then to uproot them_1 and take them_1 to another state or something	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
but uh in some of the cases i was talking about_1 in the neighborhood though they have been up rooted from another state but then but then maybe things	3100	A
had gotten where they live that they never really saw anybody much any more anyway you know	3100	A
too uh they you know get to where they don't get out that much anymore	3100	A
maybe especially_1 if they hadn't always lived in that area they're moving from	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
right	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
	3100	A
<silence>	3100	A
right and of course one thing we haven't even discussed that makes a big bearing on what you do is the cost	3100	A
you know if the parents if they were- are going into some kind of of nursing type home you know that	3100	A
helps helps them uh you know do they have the money to pay for it or are the children going to help out to make up the difference	3100	A
you know if there's two parents that might be three thousand	3100	A
<silence>	3146	A
hi Nancy well do you do a lot of dining out	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
well we do some- some dining out um i i do a lot of cooking so um	3146	A
mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and i i we don't go out too often as a family um unless it's like a fast food kind of thing	3146	A
but um but we do enjoy dining out one of our favorite places here in in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe i don't know if you have you ever been there	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
um well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and uh	3146	A
have you the- now that's down in uh Highland Park it's Highland Park Village did you like it	3146	A
oh i love it	3146	A
	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
oh it is it's fabulous it really is good	3146	A
Atlantic Cafe is down on i believe it's on McKinney	3146	A
um and originally- originally the two the the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the- the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe and then they they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific	3146	A
and i loved them both i really do i think they're wonderful	3146	A
that's our favorite you know what we'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is Houston's have you been there	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in and	3146	A
as long as you know that it's okay but they have i think one just about the best prime rib	3146	A
um anywhere in the area i love it	3146	A
and my husband really likes their ribs so it's hysterical we go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't even look at the menu i know right away what we what we want yeah yeah	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
was it	3146	A
really i've never- i've i've been there for like you know lunch but i've never been there for dinner and it was good yeah	3146	A
oh that's great that's great another nice place for for prime rib is Baby Doe's	3146	A
Maxwell's nice have you been there	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
 oh and i didn't think we ate out very often Baby Doe's is nice and one place i'd never been that i would really like to go to	3146	A
uh is Lawry's i've heard that's real good Lawry's Prime Ribs	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
i've i've never been there but i've heard it's real good	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
yes yes actually they have one in Richardson that i've been to uh they have real nice lunches have you have you been there for lunch or yeah	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
really	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
really	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
the specials	3146	A
have you ever- been to Biffin's	3146	A
i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place	3146	A
over near Plano Super Bowl and uh i've i've not been there	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
i've been there	3146	A
that was nice	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
oh i've heard of it where where it's made it's like it's like a it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag and it's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something	3146	A
yeah	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
oh	3146	A
 oh	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
oh	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
oh i bet it was i bet it was	3146	A
the last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day and we took another friend with us and	3146	A
uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves and so we had they had uh like a	3146	A
berry assortment it was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom	3146	A
and you know they they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the	3146	A
plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it was really really relatively simple but oh it was good it was really good	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
you can't find them yeah yeah yeah yeah you know i- i'm originally from Connecticut and uh	3146	A
i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and i was really amazed you know the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real	3146	A
real pretty	3146	A
but they lacked the service and they lacked the atmosphere- the just the i don't know the restaurants down here seem like they have uh	3146	A
i guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good	3146	A
and i thought i would really miss that	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
 and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it	3146	A
<silence>	3146	A
ooh really	3146	A
	3146	B
okay	3146	B
	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
no um we don't although we enjoy it um we do it more when we have company come um what about you	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
i've heard of that but i haven't been there um where about is that	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh okay i i've been to Cafe Pacific	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
right	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
yes um	3146	B
before- before we moved to the area my brother uh lived in Dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and we all ate there and oh their seafood was wonderful	3146	B
now where is the Atlantic Cafe	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh okay	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
no um but i've heard that's really good too and	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh okay but-	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
 you know right away what you want	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
well we really enjoy prime rib too and uh actually the the Steak And Ale out here um	3146	B
we've gone to uh	3146	B
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night and uh the time we went the prime rib was really good	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
yeah yeah	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh i've heard about that too but no we've uh i guess we eat out even less than i realize	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
yeah	3146	B
yes i'd i had heard that too um	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh okay	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
yes uh primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes but uh	3146	B
during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup and- or salad	3146	B
entrees and accompaniments and dessert and uh the my husband and i like veal uh a lot and their veal dishes have been good we've tried	3146	B
different ones when they've had them	3146	B
as one of the	3146	B
um-hum	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
i yes no	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
right and	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
i haven't either uh one place and i've only been there for lunch but um i went with a friend and we met her husband um down on Greenville down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's	3146	B
oh i we just we- it was and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but um	3146	B
and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert uh which was a chocolate sack i don't know if you tried but or something-	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
yes	3146	B
it yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry	3146	B
uh puree and we shared one the three of us and it was plenty because it was very rich but uh i wished i'd had a camera it was beautiful	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
uh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
yes yeah	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
oh	3146	B
it sounds wonderful	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
well that's uh one of the things the- that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant uh i love fresh berries and their	3146	B
uh their fruits are always exceptional i don't i'm know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market uh you can't find them like that and	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
i would too because well i guess because we don't go out very often when we do go out um	3146	B
in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess and uh it is it's a whole experience of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
yeah	3146	B
<silence>	3146	B
um that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful it's called Cafe Max and it's at Plano Road and Campbell	3146	B
they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three	3146	B
	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
yeah are you native to this area	3124	B
oh okay	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
yeah	3124	B
yeah it seemed like well you know last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in April and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until May	3124	B
kind of like pushed the season back a little farther and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity and it just tried to rain i mean i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago and it was trying to rain which	3124	B
seems strange to have it raining in July normally we don't have too much uh humidity or or uh rainy time when it's past June	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
right	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
well yeah see i i lived in uh Ohio mainly i lived in uh Pontiac just a little while before i came down here and	3124	B
you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade	3124	B
you know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out	3124	B
you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do	3124	B
what part of Michigan were you living in	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
okay yeah yeah	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
what brought you down here	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
uh so you teach in Plano schools	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
oh okay	3124	B
okay	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
well yeah i think a lot of people were uh leaving Michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus you know the the little joke about will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light	3124	B
	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
well you know i i said i lived in uh the Pontiac i didn't live in the city of Pontiac i lived to the west of it uh	3124	B
i forget the the county but you know where all the lakes are around there	3124	B
i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes it was real close to where i worked it was only like four miles to work	3124	B
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that you know in the summer you feel like you're you know on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and everybody's you know out enjoying the water and such and	3124	B
uh in the winter time the lakes froze over you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes there's lots of really small ones out there	3124	B
you know like maybe a mile two long that's enough to uh do some boating and was lots of fun	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
um	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
yeah yeah	3124	B
but it was yeah just lots of little lakes and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake but i just thought that was grand and i think a lot of people	3124	B
didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them but there was quite a few lakes all around there it seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where i was	3124	B
i said i wasn't close to downtown Pontiac i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from from the city limits and it was really nice out there	3124	B
we had uh Pine Knob you know to go skiing and stuff so there were things around there really was pretty nice	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
right right in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
yeah yeah	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
oh yeah yeah	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
yeah yeah we used to have a Christmas time uh some of our relatives would come up from Alabama and i think most times we would have snow around Christmas and the kids when they were young would just go nuts	3124	B
you know because they were from Alabama where it never snowed and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally	3124	B
	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
my first winter here i i came down in uh early eighty two and	3124	B
there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December before- couple days before Christmas it lasted only a few hours like by noon it was gone	3124	B
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow and i was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke ha ha	3124	B
they said no really there's snow and there was but a very short time and the weather got warm so quick just melted it all away	3124	B
course when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
yeah	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
	3124	B
<silence>	3124	B
oh yeah i think it's fun even the couple of ice storms i've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit i mean	3124	B
sometimes the ice is pretty bad but if you get on the the uh grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you can you know not slip and fall i mean first	3124	B
	3124	A
well the weather has been certainly has been hot and it's been humid i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high	3124	A
for uh this late into uh well it's not really late into the summer but the the humidity has hung around all of June	3124	A
no i grew up in Michigan so uh but i've been i've been in Texas for fifteen years	3124	A
so uh but you know i know the summers get hot but it certainly uh this humidity has just really hung on there	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yes	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
oh that's right that's right i can remember it not it's really August that it happens you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry and it just gets so dry and the earth opens up	3124	A
i can remember the first year i moved here and it didn't rain i moved here like in late August and it didn't rain	3124	A
from August until December and i went home and told them that it just doesn't rain in Texas i mean it was great after growing up in Michigan and not and all you know every day was cloudy almost every day was cloudy and i you	3124	A
you sort of forget how much it did rain and coming here and then it didn't rain it was just wonderful	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
oh yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
that's right that's right	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
that's right oh	3124	A
oh i grew up in Dearborn	3124	A
which is a suburb of of Detroit you probably know where that is because i know where Pontiac is so uh	3124	A
anyway yeah oh a teaching job	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah i did i did for a while uh-huh so i'm home with home with two children so uh so new career	3124	A
new career but uh anyway so that kind of uh well i had been down here to visit so i finished school and said hey let's you know find a place that has a nice job and uh	3124	A
 that's how it worked out	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
oh yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
	3124	A
oh well it's a nice place you know i mean it's it's a nice that's a nice place though	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
okay sort of	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
that's right that's right Lake i think Lake Whitmore is the only one i have real memories of	3124	A
which is	3124	A
well i think it's i think it's toward Ann Arbor so it's	3124	A
probably out that direction but that's the only one i probably could name after all these years so	3124	A
but uh	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
oh	3124	A
right right	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
sure sure and don't- isn't that where they have a summer music festival there too	3124	A
uh	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
that's right that's right i know we used to we we didn't do a lot of it but we did	3124	A
we did so those are always fun and Alpine was it Alpine was another ski slope that we went to so uh	3124	A
it was nice i always tell people	3124	A
that in the winter we use we used to uh my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on you know make a pond in the backyard for us	3124	A
so but uh you know we probably did some ice skating on it but then it chipped chipped and you know it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven but uh	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
oh	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
oh oh right right if only it would make nice snow here in Texas we'd be okay at Christmas time	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah yeah	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
yeah yeah i know	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
no that's not fun either so uh i i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets so	3124	A
but uh well we have our house is kind of on a little hill so uh we get the sled out and uh the kids go down the hill-	3124	A
the hill on the sleds when it's icy i mean they just go down the ice yeah if it's cold we say okay out you go i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there	3124	A
<silence>	3124	A
<silence>	3132	B
um most of my hobbies include three- three little girls	3132	B
	3132	B
they keep me pretty busy	3132	B
i uh we're home schooling	3132	B
so i um am real involved in learning how to teach and teaching and that kind of thing	3132	B
um i'm also we're expecting a baby in August so i've been trying to get some things in the house organized for that	3132	B
and have repainted a couple of chairs and repainted a dresser and some of that kind of thing um	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
um yeah we do different things uh i sew so uh i haven't had a lot of time for it for a little while but um	3132	B
that's one thing that we do do some of um i	3132	B
oh yeah yeah um i	3132	B
have i can do lots of things and i enjoy lots of different things i don't have a lot time for most of them but when i do i like uh i like art i like uh	3132	B
 the sewing um	3132	B
 let's see what else	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
i can do you know lots of different things like cross-stitch and different things but i just don't spend that much time on it uh quilting	3132	B
i've made quilts for the girls' beds and things like that um	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
yeah something to cover them and keep them warm	3132	B
that's right	3132	B
um	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
i think it could be i do a little bit of gardening	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
yeah	3132	B
it's more tedious	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
oh what do you do	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
oh wonderful	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
huh	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
i would love for my girls to take piano lessons but we've been unemployed for a while so i haven't had a chance to do that so	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
oh	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
you're more interested- interested in the instruments then in voice	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
the T I thing oh that's neat	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
uh-huh i've enjoyed music too um i was in choirs from fifth grade on i think and	3132	B
and uh had just a little piano a little violin	3132	B
i even had a little bagpipe at one time	3132	B
yeah in in ninth grade our high school is Northern Highlands in New Jersey	3132	B
and they uh they- they just that year they began teaching bagpipe for the to put together group for	3132	B
it was fun it was interesting	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
yeah	3132	B
	3132	B
but uh	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
we all enjoy music too um i don't know if they want us to specifically to do more on the craft side or	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
probably not	3132	B
	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
yeah cause-	3132	B
i don't i don't know how long we've gone but	3132	B
<silence>	3132	B
okay nice to talk to you too	3132	B
okay thank you bye-bye	3132	B
	3132	B
 well hi Nola this is Vic uh do you have any hobbies that uh that you really participate in	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
oh	3132	A
	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
is that right	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
oh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
do you have uh as part of your home schooling do you have any like uh handicraft type things that you've done with with your children	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
 do you actually sew some clothes for them and that sort of stuff or have you before	3132	A
oh that's good	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
right	3132	A
um	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
well that's nice	3132	A
something they can keep for a long time and enjoy later on	3132	A
keep them warm that's always beneficial too	3132	A
yeah	3132	A
 well i think most of my hobbies are i don't really have any handicrafts that i can speak of i've done some woodworking type things but uh uh	3132	A
i don't really consider yard work a hobby either i guess it's uh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
yeah i do some of that and i i must admit that i do enjoy a certain amount of it i guess it's when it's a requirement such as mowing a lawn that it becomes somewhat less of a hobby	3132	A
yeah but um	3132	A
 i'm interested in music so i do a few things in that regard	3132	A
well i uh uh my children are uh learning to play the piano	3132	A
and it's been ages ago since i played but i still like to sit down and and play around with the piano myself some	3132	A
and i have twelve year old daughter that's	3132	A
far surpassed any ability that i ever have had	3132	A
um	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
yeah and uh also there's an instrument of all things called a recorder	3132	A
uh and i- i play that some just by ear i don't and music on that	3132	A
i used to play the clarinet and i still have one or actually recently just got another one and uh i play it from time to time as well	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
well i am in a a church choir in fact it's that organization that uh it is doing this fund raising using uh	3132	A
uh the T I thing for that- for that- for that as a matter of fact and that's that's why i'm enrolled in this is our choir is doing it so that that i can pass a good bit of time and i do enjoy that a great deal	3132	A
um and i bike i bike ride i guess that's really the closest thing to a bonafide hobby that i have	3132	A
just a sort of combination between bicycling and exercise or hobby and an exercise so that's probably the extent of my hobbies	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
um	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
did you really well that's different	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
oh you had to play the	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
yeah	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
i bet that was	3132	A
that's very different	3132	A
uh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
well i'm not sure that it really matters a whole lot at all	3132	A
 that's sort of been my interpretation of of these conversations um	3132	A
	3132	A
in fact i think we probably uh	3132	A
<silence>	3132	A
have talked long enough	3132	A
would be my guess so	3132	A
yeah oh i'm sure it's been adequate	3132	A
so i enjoyed talking with you	3132	A
and and good luck with your children	3132	A
all right bye-bye	3132	A
	3132	A
	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
right that a that a a a a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not depend- and and uh	3162	B
not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective well i- i i certainly haven't thought much about this but	3162	B
	3162	B
i was trying to remember back it seems to me that that you know when i studied civics in school or stuff that this	3162	B
the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't wasn't so much and i'm i'm trying to	3162	B
figure out whether that's i'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state	3162	B
	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
yeah and	3162	B
uh i guess- i guess uh and i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some	3162	B
 Supreme Supreme Court decision perhaps that said that uh that uh as part of the trial by the peers that i had to include the sentencing or too or whatever i'd yeah but i	3162	B
yeah i- i certainly wouldn't be uh uh worried about that i guess in terms of the uh	3162	B
uh you know having- having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and uh unbiased uh	3162	B
in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury i guess i guess i uh	3162	B
 would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in a trial system that that's just a such a tradition that it's a that it's got to be a unanimous jury that uh	3162	B
i don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else uh you know uh two thirds or three fourths or whatever but uh	3162	B
and and i- i- i certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority um	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
yeah yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
 whatever yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	B
	3162	B
well and and i'm i'd i'd i know it is i know it is where i where i work but i'm not sure that that's	3162	B
that that's necessarily required uh you know by law that it has to be paid um	3162	B
i suspect that's a that's a	3162	B
benefit of a bigger company but but there are certainly some	3162	B
	3162	B
 some that some that wouldn't uh yeah	3162	B
<silence>	3162	A
okay	3162	A
um well it's not such a bad idea to think about judges uh	3162	A
you know taking the idea of uh	3162	A
uh sentencing in into their hands versus you know the jury especially if it's a highly publicized case	3162	A
such as uh you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read uh certain	3162	A
uh things in regards to cases like the Dahmer case in Milwaukee and stuff so it's it may be an idea to think about	3162	A
you know cost trying to find a jury so you can- get a jury as far as	3162	A
um they may say they're not biased but deep down they are against- against this person or whatever so um i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about so	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
exactly	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
	3162	A
catches you off guard doesn't it	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
i didn't think they were either i thought the sentencing was done by the judge and it's either guilty or not guilty	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
changes	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
oh sure yeah yeah	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
exactly exactly	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
exactly	3162	A
uh-huh	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
kind of how i you knows in certain cases i can see them going uh uh just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict	3162	A
uh simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small	3162	A
um maybe uh you did a crime that was uh	3162	A
burglary or whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized but when you get into these highly publicized cases	3162	A
where everybody knows details whether it's through the National Enquirer or whatever	3162	A
um it's the idea that person might initially have this thought well jeez this person's guilty no matter what i'm not gonna listen to the facts or and and	3162	A
con their way into uh getting past the lawyers and and getting through that but um also there's the aspect of cost and i i'm not quite sure how much cost it does	3162	A
take for uh the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's uh very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what	3162	A
you know being that i'm not in the that area i really don't know but i wonder	3162	A
if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial	3162	A
and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at least- give them the time off	3162	A
from work uh whether it i think it's with pay if i remember jury duty is with pay	3162	A
and uh it's not it	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
hm	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
paid right	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
some that may decide not to	3162	A
<silence>	3162	A
hm	3162	A
	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
well uh i agree that they have problems but i- i'm afraid i'm very much against universal health um my daughter is uh	3153	B
uh stationed in England right now and of course you know they've had uh group health uh over there for some time um	3153	B
i was over there last- uh a year ago when my granddaughter was born	3153	B
and uh she had some problems and uh i was horrified from beginning to end first of all they are about fifty years behind	3153	B
they don't have and their medical technology the doctors since they aren't responsible really to each patient don't feel they have to sit down and talk to you about the problems	3153	B
when they want to do something to a patient whether the patient is a few days old or eighty or ninety they do it they don't ask permission	3153	B
my daughter went um upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didn't even know they were going to do surgery on the baby uh	3153	B
yes it was it was really terrible that's why i went over there i mean she was she cried she called and was you know really you know upset um the day we were leaving the hospital finally	3153	B
um we were getting all ready to go home and finally you know the baby was okay and everything was fine and the doctor that had been working with her poked his head in the door and he said by the way he said in six weeks he want you to come back uh	3153	B
for a test- uh uh a test that we want to do on on her um for uh uh	3153	B
multiple sclerosis	3153	B
and he turned around and left	3153	B
and we just kind of looked at each other and said what	3153	B
uh for what and i i tried for fifteen minutes to find the doctor and he was unavailable	3153	B
	3153	B
	3153	B
 well the the thing is these are the HMO's that they have now which are cheaper and you can in my daughter- my other daughter belongs to an HMO or they used to thankfully they've just changed um you don't	3153	B
you only get a choice of doctors that are in your area not necessarily of doctors that are good or not uh see i i've worked for i worked for Johns Hopkins for two years	3153	B
uh at the hospital there and i've worked for a private doctor for two years and um	3153	B
	3153	B
get him out of there she said well he hasn't done anything wrong it's just that he has poor judgment and i thought oh gosh i mean you're the doctor telling you this you know um	3153	B
some horror stories like that but then when with the HMO um the they sent her to a pediatrician that had one gentleman that was uh	3153	B
uh in his late seventies	3153	B
and an Indian doctor that she couldn't understand and that had no patience with children	3153	B
and you know it was kind of that was kind of a bad experience too so when they changed she finally got	3153	B
you know a good pediatrician but uh uh it it it's	3153	B
it's just a little scary when you don't have as much when you can't just go say hey here's a good doctor i'm going to go to this doctor you know um	3153	B
and i i fear that the doctors are going to not be as you know right now they're in a lot of fierce competition so they they keep up to date you know at least most of them the good ones	3153	B
um i- i i don't know i just fear that uh that it may go downhill if we do indeed you know change to something like that uh	3153	B
no it doesn't uh also	3153	B
uh we uh my husband was a civilian but we were uh stationed overseas for a while and so i had to go to	3153	B
myself and the children had to go do military doctors huh wow now that's another story you know so but it's the same	3153	B
same thing i mean these doctors didn't want to be here okay they were fulfilling their military obligations and you know they uh of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they uh	3153	B
well enjoy the field but um the- i have found	3153	B
uh through people that i know that have HMO's that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking	3153	B
i mean not speaking but like Indian doctors you can't understand them because of their their um uh accent	3153	B
uh or uh Chinese or and i have nothing against them in fact i went to a doctor for years that was a Chinese doctor but i could understand what he was saying	3153	B
you know so i just it just this is a bad subject for me to be on only because i've had some real bad experiences and i've known some people that have uh	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
 been	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
right well i'll tell you now what you do	3153	B
is you go uh to the doctors and just meet them	3153	B
and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you give him	3153	B
i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um uh if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that uh	3153	B
is uh uh	3153	B
is usually pretty good but uh uh you know you- i'd try him out	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
yeah oh it should- okay see that's it	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
yeah so that's see that's what scares me about going into universal health	3153	B
okay i mean you could you could really be in serious trouble if you wait to see one of the ones that you feel are better if uh uh you know if we went to that and that was all there was	3153	B
um uh	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
oh well they don't it would it would still be like it is now um the ones in your area	3153	B
you know and that would be closest to where you live uh and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume um	3153	B
but uh but also now in England how they work it is you go to see a regular MD	3153	B
if he determines that it's necessary then he'll send you to a gynecologist or a surgeon or you know you can't just go there	3153	B
uh	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
yes	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
um-hum	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
yep	3153	B
<silence>	3153	B
um hum	3153	B
that's right and uh i mean you know that could potentially be um	3153	B
rather	3153	B
	3153	A
all right um how do you feel about the health insurance problems	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
wow	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
oh my God what a terrible thing for her to go through	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
ah	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
right	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
right	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
oh	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
	3153	A
ah	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
right	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
that doesn't give any incentive	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
i guess so	3153	A
i just joined an HMO i just got a new job and i haven't heard i haven't been i haven't even actually paid for it or actually started my coverage yet but that's what they have is HMO and	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
well what they told me at at work they told me that uh	3153	A
	3153	A
so	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
how would they decide who get's which doctor	3153	A
	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
oh i see local	3153	A
	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
right that the same for the HMO and and because the doctors work for the HMO the people i work with are telling me you know HMO's are great if you're generally healthy	3153	A
and you just go for the checkup every year or whatever it's just three dollars but if you have a problem then it's real hard to get the doctor to refer you to a specialist because they're told you know not to because_1 it cost the HMO money	3153	A
<silence>	3153	A
	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
oh well that's we rent a lot of videos too um we saw i have two little babies and we saw one movie recently and that was um The Terminator movie um then which i didn't like after all	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
well i don't either it on all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie he doesn't he maims them	3155	B
 so	3155	B
um-hum he he uh i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part in the movie so	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
oh i haven't seen that one yet	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
uh-huh	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
oh	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
yeah well it's	3155	B
with all the commercials uh and everything i haven't that's one we wanna see i i wanna see uh Dances With Wolves but we haven't seen that one yet either on video	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
yeah three that's what i heard too	3155	B
yeah we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it so we saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone Oscar	3155	B
supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy which was an interesting movie but not very funny	3155	B
unfortunately-	3155	B
did she	3155	B
well it was it was an amusing movie it just- i guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to uh at the house watching it with with no one else around so	3155	B
	3155	B
oh	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
um-hum	3155	B
my son just turned two and so The Little Mermaid is now our favorite movie	3155	B
we've Little Mermaid and Peter Pan i think are are his two favorites that we've got	3155	B
 so	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
oh i haven't i didn't hear that was coming out	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
well they just had uh The Rescuers movie that was a Disney movie wasn't it i think i heard that was just one was just out he's uh he doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet but he likes to uh	3155	B
to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the movie- in the movie so -that's	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
 well i well- tell you ever since- my my kids are just small babies and i tell you we we really want to go a lot and uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it	3155	B
sometimes	3155	B
so	3155	B
um-hum that seems to happen i noticed that Dances With Wolves was playing at the uh Granada Theater	3155	B
and uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie i thought that might be kind of fun to do	3155	B
and of course you need a babysitter for that definitely but uh you know i'd really like to get out to the movies more often course it's so expensive now too	3155	B
that you can't hardly afford it i i don't- know we get discount tickets	3155	B
where my husband works but other than that it just seems like it's so expensive and then the popcorn and everything else you almost can't afford to do it	3155	B
no matter what well we did actually get we went on vacation couple months ago and we got to go see What About Bob	3155	B
that was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray	3155	B
that was fun	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
oh he's a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist and Bob is his patient	3155	B
and Bob follows him on vacation it's kind of	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
um-hum um-hum	3155	B
um-hum	3155	B
yeah that's the one	3155	B
<silence>	3155	B
	3155	B
must have left an impression	3155	B
	3155	B
	3155	A
i really haven't seen any movies lately so when the computer picked this one i was a little bit surprised but i think i haven't been to the movie theater here in about oh six months but um	3155	A
you know the last movies that i've seen were probably on video	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
yeah	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
yeah now i haven't- i haven't seen The Terminator movie but and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it i don't particularly care for that sort of stuff	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
yeah right yeah he maims them_1 pretty good doesn't he	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
yeah uh-huh i- i saw uh Sleeping with the Enemy oh um i saw it uh oh couple weeks ago i rented it and um	3155	A
 watched it and i was i was pretty disappointed in it because i- i was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense and i was pretty disappointed in it now it's- it's a good movie but i guess uh that they built me up too much	3155	A
 for my expectations in it there	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah now i haven't seen it either but uh i've heard that it's real long that it's a good movie but it's long like three hours	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
that's right that's right	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
Oscar	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A

um-hum	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A

<silence>	3155	A
uh-huh yeah it's fixing to come out on video and boy i can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out but	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
right	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
um-hum well i'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
yeah	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
that's right and then they go to the dollar movies	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
yeah that does sound fun	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
right	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
that's right	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
golly i don't think that i've ever heard of that movie	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
 oh that's the that's the one where they burn down the house or something the house explodes	3155	A
oh okay	3155	A
okay yeah another movie that i wanna see if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is um oh i just forgot the title of it um	3155	A
<silence>	3155	A
oh it's supposed to be a real scary one	3155	A
 um	3155	A
darn well here here's another one that i've seen i saw um	3155	A
i can't remember the title of it either um yeah it really did it's it's uh	3155	A
 okay	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
uh-huh	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
i am too yes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
uh-huh	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
oh that's good	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
and how old is your baby	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yes well i walk two and a half to three miles every night	3181	A
my husband and i were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago and he lost sixty two pounds and i lost twenty one	3181	A
so we've decided to maintain our weight that we will do this exercise walking program and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school we have a little path that we do	3181	A
and uh except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been we try to get out um every every night	3181	A
and he plays racquetball twice a week but i'm not into that so i think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
right that's right i know my kids are into sports and a lot of times tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty so we will just go out after that	3181	A
so my kids luckily are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
no my husband never was either until he lost the weight that was his decision he had arthritis in his hips and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise	3181	A
so once he got motivated now he's ready to walk every night and our dog has lost a little weight he walks every night too	3181	A
so he gets excited when he sees us put on our our shoes our walking shoes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
making time for it	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
i know i do too	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
right	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
no i never do either even if i have my dog with me you know it's nice to have another person there but	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
mostly it's my husband and sometimes it's my kids	3181	A
oh	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
uh-huh	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
me too i did the dance step when i lived up in Michigan and it just wore me out i would leave totally exhausted i never lost any weight and i got to the point i dreaded going in	3181	A
so walking seems to be a good solution for me and it doesn't cost anything	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yes	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
that's the one time in the day my husband and i can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and	3181	A
hm yep	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yep	3181	A
<silence>	3181	A
yep that's all i do too okay	3181	A
	3181	B
all right well i'm not a big exerciser but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight	3181	B
and so basically at this point i'm i'm a real walker	3181	B
are you i don't do that oh i guess i'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips you know and keep their arms up i don't do that	3181	B
i mostly just take a a walk around the block or with my baby or you know and i have to do that at least once a day	3181	B
if it if it's going to make any effect on since i have to eat	3181	B
the same as i did before i can't neglect that because_1 of the baby either	3181	B
she just uh	3181	B
well she was premature so she's about nine months now though golly- times goes fast	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
oh that's great	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
oh my goodness	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
uh-huh	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
uh-huh	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
yeah exactly	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
well i think that is just wonderful now as far as i'm concerned i have several other children and so	3181	B
um i think at this point to fit it into to to other things it's kind of a task you know um	3181	B
	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
yeah now does your husband usually go with you then oh see now that's really nice because mine's at meetings sometimes and and he's not really into it so i have to	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
i think that is so wonderful	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
i bet	3181	B
i think that's really really good and and you know it- i think this after you've done it a certain amount of time it kind of does get to be a routine it's not like when i first started it	3181	B
you know that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there but now if i haven't done it in a day or two or something i really notice	3181	B
that i haven't done it in you know and i like the time because my kids sometimes they come with me and sometimes they don't	3181	B
and when they don't i i really notice you know it how fun it can be when they come so um i like to have somebody come with me	3181	B
um i know most of enough- enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home around this block area so it would- it's not real dangerous but still i don't like to go alone so	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
yeah	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
yeah you know	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
well i think that's great i'm and well sometimes when i	3181	B
i take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise i i really think	3181	B
i do i was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing um	3181	B
i found real quick that wasn't for me	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
yeah yeah	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
<silence>	3181	B
yeah need something or they can wait till you get back home well i think that's great	3181	B
	3181	B
	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
and well that's interesting isn't it yeah	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
right	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
 what did you think about that idea	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
hm they've not really given it attention either yeah	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
right	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions they uh	3161	B
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because_1 they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing	3161	B
so i i would hate to have that responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address	3161	B
i uh	3161	B
i guess i it it frightens me to think of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer and	3161	B
many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other	3161	B
whether it's through	3161	B
prevention or or treatment or you know	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves	3161	B
so it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
just change our priorities-	3161	B
right just change our priorities a little bit and	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
right	3161	B
<silence>	3161	B
 the AIDS issue is	3161	A
is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how	3161	A
can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are	3161	A
on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending	3161	A
as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more people- mean more people than AIDS	3161	A
and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer	3161	A
so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh	3161	A
i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that	3161	A
whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh	3161	A
it's just one big PR campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS	3161	A
and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those	3161	A
well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded	3161	A
and uh having thought about that for a while	3161	A
 well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i got- i got to thinking	3161	A
the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood antigen- antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood	3161	A
and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years	3161	A
so it's not really cure for- yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major	3161	A
uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it	3161	A
through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever	3161	A
how they fund whatever um illness they wish it's- it's kind of hard to	3161	A
to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or	3161	A
<silence>	3161	A
right	3161	A
<silence>	3161	A
right	3161	A
<silence>	3161	A
that's true	3161	A
you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh	3161	A
i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a	3161	A
a unfair advantage as they were but	3161	A
the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money	3161	A
uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but	3161	A
we have such an affluent -society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's	3161	A
yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but	3161	A
