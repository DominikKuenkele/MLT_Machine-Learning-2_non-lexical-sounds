um-hum	3763	B
uh baseball	3763	B
well i've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers	3763	B
uh	3763	B
more so with uh	3763	B
uh their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that that closely	3763	B
but uh since- you know since i live here so close to Arlington uh	3763	B
that's the team that i've been kind of following	3763	B
um-hum	3763	B
right	3763	B
well i think that uh	3763	B
you know with uh	3763	B
so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um	3763	B
you know i think	3763	B
i'm not real sure about that- do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's uh	3763	B
yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit	3763	B
yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five million- that's a lot of money	3763	B
yeah they are	3763	B
um-hum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to	3763	B
i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh	3763	B
uh pay him what his salary's going to be	3763	B
uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent	3763	B
and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway	3763	B
but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the six- you know the six million dollars a year this year	3763	B
uh-huh	3763	B
oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him	3763	B
yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh	3763	B
Pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the Rangers are concerned i think	3763	B
i think they need some definitely need some pitching	3763	B
uh	3763	B
and so i you know i	3763	B
um the pitching coach	3763	B
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was going- was helping out uh	3763	B
his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh	3763	B
oh you don't like Howse huh	3763	B
oh Tom Grieve	3763	B
yeah i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet	3763	B
but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they	3763	B
that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and	3763	B
um	3763	B
you do huh	3763	B
that's contrary to uh popular belief you know	3763	B
oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know	3763	B
they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and	3763	B
and uh	3763	B
yeah	3763	B
are you there okay now tell me your favorite team	3763	A
yes	3763	A
okay i think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed	3763	A
so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers	3763	A
what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do	3763	A
well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his	3763	A
yes and the Rangers go up a little bit um-hum	3763	A
i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest	3763	A
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous	3763	A
no	3763	A
that's right	3763	A
what i saw on the news today that Buechele- Buechele was back just to visit	3763	A
i'm awful sorry he's not still	3763	A
oh i'm sure it was	3763	A
Pittsburgh yeah	3763	A
yes sir	3763	A
well what do you think of Howse	3763	A
who is the coach for the pitchers	3763	A
yes	3763	A
his assistant	3763	A
um-hum	3763	A
i really wish they could	3763	A
see fit to get rid of Howse	3763	A
no no i really don't	3763	A
and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of Howse and i'm not fond of Grieves	3763	A
yeah	3763	A
well i'm just gullible enough that i think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right	3763	A
and i'm sure well	3763	A
oh i know i know so but i would like so much	3763	A
for these Rangers to get their act together and give um	3763	A
oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs	3763	A
i understand	3763	A
well	3763	A
i just oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and let's us have-	3763	A
do work in a large organization now	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
oh yeah that's pretty big	3724	A
i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees	3724	A
i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um	3724	A
besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss	3724	A
yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one	3724	A
right everyone's so integral	3724	A
um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too	3724	A
well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know- in a larger	3724	A
really in health care uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh vacation and	3724	A
and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits	3724	A
uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without	3724	A
um-hum um-hum	3724	A
right that really gets prohibitive	3724	A
yes i've heard that too	3724	A
it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um	3724	A
my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't	3724	A
he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the security of an organization's benefits	3724	A
it- it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand	3724	A
um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it	3724	A
the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical	3724	A
yeah	3724	A
you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh	3724	A
a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer	3724	A
so as as of this date my husband and my kids are free because_1 they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if	3724	A
exactly	3724	A
um well i- i work in a actually it's sort of an odd situation right now but uh	3724	B
i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization	3724	B
and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago	3724	B
but it's it's not really a large organization but uh nearly- nearly five hundred people	3724	B
yeah how about_1 yourself are you	3724	B
that's	3724	B
uh-huh	3724	B
hum	3724	B
yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh	3724	B
ooh yeah i i think it it's probably- the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah-	3724	B
yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's	3724	B
it's generally important	3724	B
but	3724	B
um um-hum	3724	B
what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things	3724	B
yeah	3724	B
yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent	3724	B
yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean- it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses	3724	B
and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations	3724	B
also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization	3724	B
and uh	3724	B
i you- you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them_1 i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um	3724	B
um typically let's see uh typically the myself i- i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in to- for them to be covered but it was pretty economical	3724	B
um especially relative to just buying your own health care package	3724	B
yeah and so you know- so that's that's handy uh you know i think that it- i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead	3724	B
uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary	3724	B
and which is which is pretty amazing	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
right are	3724	B
oh well um-hum yeah that's good- i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think	3724	B
um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
oh uh-huh copayment uh uh-huh	3724	B
right	3724	B
yeah i- i mean i	3724	B
typically- you- typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um	3724	B
you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping	3724	B
well how do you feel about um putting an elderly family family member in a nursing home	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah oh i agree i it's it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel um	3702	A
i- i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families	3702	A
and yet i understand um well we may be facing that with my grandmother she lives- is living near my parents out in California	3702	A
and they this year they moved her into a um retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care	3702	A
but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and	3702	A
it's it's difficult because i know my mother feels really um torn about it she doesn't want to	3702	A
to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the the place is like um	3702	A
i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and	3702	A
um and yet it's a real burden to her to have to to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah i uh i was thinking you know it might	3702	A
i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there	3702	A
um because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's it's been negative where the	3702	A
and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time	3702	A
then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've i've been to other places where you know the people have told me um this is a really good place the people here really care about us so	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah well no um but all the years that i've been alive she has um for the last thirty years or so	3702	A
it's Central California	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
yeah well this is Fresno uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
i'm not too happy about the idea although	3702	B
i do realize that sometimes it becomes necessary to do that or to have round the clock kind of health- care available in the house	3702	B
which often is is not that um easy to to do sometimes it really is easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be given	3702	B
i'm very happy that in my life so far i have not had to do that kind of a thing um	3702	B
my own mother lived with us for some years and uh just died peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life and uh i never had to face that personally	3702	B
and uh what do you think you might do in such a situation	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
oh	3702	B
oh yes	3702	B
i see	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
uh-huh	3702	B
that's right um-hum	3702	B
yeah people are just not as home as much as they used to be um sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet and	3702	B
um and therefore uh they have to leave the older person all the by themselves or with the care of somebody else and some of the diseases that uh older people have uh do require more intensive surveillance	3702	B
so uh it it isn't easy i suppose one of the	3702	B
uh best things if you are considering a nursing home is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations i know i always trust the opinion of a	3702	B
close friend uh above just what i might read about a place if somebody i knew and cared about liked a place and said no this was good and	3702	B
we were happy about the personnel and the care et cetera and so forth i would it certainly would go up in my estimation	3702	B
and uh sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best uh place is um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
yeah	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
well there's hope i guess uh has uh your grandmother always lived in California	3702	B
oh	3702	B
i see yeah	3702	B
yeah what part of California is that	3702	B
oh i see we used to live out there in the San Jose area so uh you know i'm kind of familiar with the state of California and like it very much yeah	3702	B
but um uh it's uh it's a difficult situation uh sometimes also when you get involved in the	3702	B
in those residences for the elderly the retirement homes and and also uh maybe even the nursing division of a residence home	3702	B
um it's tremendously expensive and sometimes they ask you to uh	3702	B
um well where are some of the places you've been	3794	B
um-hum	3794	B
well i've been a lot of different places uh	3794	B
Hawaii Japan Europe	3794	B
and and-	3794	B
most of the fifty	3794	B
i haven't been to Alaska yet	3794	B
yeah i thought we might go up on the uh inland ferry that goes up there from uh from British-	3794	B
right	3794	B
yes	3794	B
oh yeah it's a long desolate stretch but well desolate in that it's all uh the same scenery after a while just like driving in the desert you know after a while it all looks the same	3794	B
huh	3794	B
no no	3794	B
well actually Hawaii is getting cheap too because uh	3794	B
with the economic uh	3794	B
situation- uh situation we're in they've lowered the prices uh quite a bit	3794	B
where do you stay when you go to Virginia on the beach	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
yeah i bet	3794	B
well if he's a landscape architect he ought to like Washington DC in the daylight hours	3794	B
your dad's in the military	3794	B
retired- retired	3794	B
well being from uh living in Texas you probably like cool weather on your uh vacations at least we do	3794	B
uh	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
well usually vacation time July August September it's time to go somewhere else	3794	B
oh yeah	3794	B
um	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
no no i haven't	3794	B
yeah i saw the Sixty- Sixty Minutes also last year we went to uh the Oregon coast and- and that is really beautiful	3794	B
and it's also unlike California completely because it's cool enough that you don't have uh the surfers much because they need protective clothing you know	3794	B
and- and uh there's really uh several nice places to stay along the coast there	3794	B
we stayed at what was called the uh kite capital of the world what was the name of that city- place	3794	B
Lincoln City	3794	B
and it is really nice uh we a very nice place on the beach and very reasonably priced compared to California particularly	3794	B
so- in fact most of the	3794	B
that's right most of the Californians that uh want to stay on the coast apparently the families and so forth they come up to Oregon and Washington coast to stay because it's much uh more economical	3794	B
yeah we've we've been up that way and well this that trip we also went to uh Vancouver and out to uh Victoria which is very nice	3794	B
well you got you haven't been to California either then	3794	B
well if you go to California don't go to Los Angeles unless you really want to just see the movie stars set up and so forth	3794	B
but uh San Diego and San Francisco are both very nice right	3794	B
i don't know about you but i haven't had any trouble having any fun on vacation	3794	A
i can't think of any place i wouldn't want to go to take one	3794	A
oh i know a real good place is Virginia	3794	A
it's real nice	3794	A
it has mountains beach whatever you want	3794	A
have you been in any great places lately	3794	A
oh now i haven't been there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
you plan on going	3794	A
oh yeah now i'd like to go uh to Canada on the boat	3794	A
my parents went not long ago	3794	A
or to Key West have you ever been to Key West	3794	A
is it pretty	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
oh no	3794	A
no i've never been huh is it very expensive	3794	A
not compared to Hawaii huh	3794	A
really	3794	A
well that's nice to know	3794	A
well that's good	3794	A
um yeah i've been to Virginia Beach and i've been up to the uh homestead in hot springs in the mountains it's real nice	3794	A
and uh oh let's see i've been to Charlottesville through Monticello uh my husband's a a landscape architect and he uh he really liked that and to see Thomas Jefferson's home	3794	A
yeah now we we went there went there to stay at the Army Navy club with my dad and that was real nice that was real nice	3794	A
uh no he used to be he he's a retired attorney now uh but he was the uh he was uh uh	3794	A
in the reserves for quite a long time and uh he's active in something right now i forgot what it is	3794	A
but um i he's somehow connected still with it	3794	A
yeah sometimes- sometimes you know when it in when it's getting really hot in Texas you know you want to go someplace cool	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
have you ever been to Arkansas	3794	A
now i've i've been but not to way up at near Branson oh i hear it's just booming up there now	3794	A
up around Silver- Silver- Silver Dollar City have you been there	3794	A
i heard on uh what was it Sixty Minutes or something a lot of the country western um people are starting to build their nightclubs up there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
really	3794	A
how about population is it very uh crowded	3794	A
hum	3794	A
oh	3794	A
oh i bet	3794	A
really i bet but- but it's not as crowded either	3794	A
huh	3794	A
yeah i'd like to go up around Washington sometime to see	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
well i think the furthest west i've ever gotten is the Grand Canyon	3794	A
no huh-uh no	3794	A
oh i won't	3794	A
no no no	3794	A
really	3794	A
i know my grandparents have been to San Francisco years ago and they said it was real nice-	3794	A
well i could do with a lot less than that	3782	B
i live in Dallas	3782	B
oh good well i live in Plano in that case	3782	B
oh yeah i do yeah	3782	B
yes	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
i know	3782	B
and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i don't know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and that's how it started with uh four percent five percent	3782	B
and all of a sudden here we are now	3782	B
and it's horrible	3782	B
well	3782	B
it's true but they did without it all those years	3782	B
and they keep talking about the state tax and they'll probably put one in and they'll have this too so	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
well i hope it doesn't but you know how it goes so	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
raise them	3782	B
oh	3782	B
oh well it will	3782	B
probably the first season	3782	B
but they're funny about things like that here	3782	B
they really are when i came here you couldn't buy beer couldn't buy a drink nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know	3782	B
so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
oh that is	3782	B
oh	3782	B
hm	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
that is	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
hm	3782	B
oh yeah that is	3782	B
uh uh they well they do a little bit but um	3782	B
it's it's like next to nothing i've seen it it's on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
it costs what	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
really	3782	B
God	3782	B
yeah so you haven't been here very long	3782	B
you haven't been here very long	3782	B
two years	3782	B
um-hum	3782	B
uh yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
no i don't i'm a nurse i work down at Presbyterian	3782	B
yeah oh it is you know they're supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least that's what i heard that you could- could get to do ten calls	3782	B
and this is like the seventeenth	3782	B
yeah so it's great	3782	B
so what do you think about the uh income taxes	3782	A
where do you live	3782	A
okay i live in Dallas too	3782	A
okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i-	3782	A
yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax	3782	A
it i think it's like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there	3782	A
Washington DC was only six percent	3782	A
and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half	3782	A
it was only four percent	3782	A
really	3782	A
um-hum um-hum	3782	A
what	3782	A
since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because_1 Virginia does have a state tax	3782	A
um-hum hm	3782	A
yeah it	3782	A
if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset	3782	A
because_1 i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck	3782	A
uh every two weeks and uh if that comes back in	3782	A
i'll be pretty mad because_1 sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know	3782	A
so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax	3782	A
yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes	3782	A
and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing	3782	A
they're putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because_1 of that yeah they said uh to build okay	3782	A
apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds	3782	A
and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds	3782	A
well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes	3782	A
but it seems like it would pay itself off	3782	A
so you know what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know	3782	A
yeah so you know	3782	A
yeah things like that you know	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
no huh	3782	A
um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe	3782	A
but uh like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties	3782	A
and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh	3782	A
on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up	3782	A
you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year	3782	A
and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year	3782	A
but that gets real expensive	3782	A
do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know	3782	A
um	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks	3782	A
so it's only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your property- personal property tax	3782	A
for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess	3782	A
that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out	3782	A
what's that	3782	A
i've been here about two years now	3782	A
but uh in the two years i've i've been here i've been through i've had two cars	3782	A
so i've never really like you know	3782	A
i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax	3782	A
on the car other than what i paid when i registered- uh registered the car	3782	A
so that's the only thing i can really think of	3782	A
so so do you work for TI or you just doing this	3782	A
okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool	3782	A
oh do they really	3782	A
yeah i- i don't know how the thing works uh	3782	A
oh really all right you	3782	A
yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be	3759	B
i haven't had any real uh recent problems with that i've been a little bit leery i have mail ordered uh a uh video camera from New York	3759	B
and i was worried that that might uh cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
just can you hold on just one sec	3759	B
i got a six year old that's going out of off of his mind he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
do you buy um do you buy much mail order	3759	B
do you buy much mail order	3759	B
uh-huh have you had any problems with that at all	3759	B
oh uh-huh	3759	B
oh yeah	3759	B
well some some places are good about sending them_1 out by UPS or or other ways but	3759	B
i think most of the time i uh maybe it's just the kind of shopper i am i will uh decide on the kind of thing i want and	3759	B
try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and and generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but	3759	B
uh maybe it's the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i'm saying	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh well at least they're	3759	B
trying to uh give you some kind of concession there	3759	B
i'm trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back	3759	B
i bought some clothing i don't know if you get these Lands' End catalogs	3759	B
they uh make mail order clothing and most of it's very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years	3759	B
and um they've been very good with the exception of one that had the uh button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it	3759	B
and uh	3759	B
no they're real good in fact i've had the shirt for uh actually i probably had it for over a year	3759	B
and the only reason i called them_1 on it is because i'd had similar shirts that held up for several years	3759	B
and uh they said uh regardless that you've you know worn it for a year or over a year we'll uh take it back and give you a new one	3759	B
huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
right	3759	B
well i think that's uh that's really just good business you know	3759	B
if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do you've got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back	3759	B
you know that's like i've seen on this mail order if they were uh skin flints about it and wouldn't take it back	3759	B
i mean they they uh depend on that kind of a reputation so much	3759	B
you know	3759	B
oh yeah this they're sporting aren't they uh-huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
uh-huh you said you'd bought uh cars recently what kind of cars have you {boughten}	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
uh-huh you haven't had any problems with it though huh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
what's your feeling about American versus foreign and	3759	B
did you hear the topic Carol	3759	A
right	3759	A
oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been	3759	A
you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted	3759	A
you know for a good part	3759	A
yes	3759	A
oh	3759	A
i think i think the only problem i've had in the last two or three years is i was- i was in Germany a couple of years ago and	3759	A
bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didn't receive everything but you know that's you sort of take that chance you buy something like that	3759	A
pardon me	3759	A
oh a little bit	3759	A
no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands	3759	A
i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item	3759	A
you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and	3759	A
two days after i bought them i picked them_1 up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh	3759	A
get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over	3759	A
he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference	3759	A
which i thought was fair	3759	A
sure	3759	A
but overall i think i'm uh	3759	A
no	3759	A
right	3759	A
any trouble getting it back	3759	A
sure	3759	A
i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they don't have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything	3759	A
so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
oh absolutely	3759	A
yeah mail- mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk	3759	A
right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if you're dissatisfied with it in anyway and they're very easy get along- get along with and they don't mind taking something back	3759	A
i bought a Lincoln	3759	A
and uh	3759	A
up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit	3759	A
it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now	3759	A
no not really you know it's like the old uh saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true	3759	A
but they don't build them like they used to but	3759	A
uh just about_1 um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last ten or twenty years	3704	B
and um i guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field	3704	B
that uh of course when i was growing up not very many women went to work at all most everyone was at home	3704	B
and some of my friends whose mothers were teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their mothers weren't at home	3704	B
yes and uh but nowadays it's just so common	3704	B
a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that i've had children i've stopped uh working	3704	B
that it's kind of embarrassing when i go to a store and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work number please and then i don't have a work number to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
yes	3704	B
that's true	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right	3704	B
right	3704	B
no and it wasn't like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it's it's pennies but for them it's just a socialized behavior	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
that's true that's probably true	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right me too	3704	B
well that's good in in in our homes we all have a lot- uh much more high tech compared to the people ten twenty years ago	3704	B
right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right we	3704	B
load up on all of the conveniences and they're not special to us anymore just a	3704	B
necessity and there's the people who don't have televisions are	3704	B
are uh you know unusual in our society	3704	B
um-hum um-hum	3704	B
what was the topic	3704	A
i said uh	3704	A
right- right	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah	3704	A
yeah really	3704	A
uh oh	3704	A
there there was a stigma attached to it	3704	A
and- and a necessity	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
uh-huh	3704	A
yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i- i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work	3704	A
yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i- i thought well	3704	A
you know in a lot of different ways i- i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much it's changed i mean uh	3704	A
uh i live in Houston but i'm i'm in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami it's i mean honestly English is almost a second language now	3704	A
uh you know with all the uh influx of uh South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh	3704	A
i- i guess a majority in Miami you know of- course in Houston uh you've got the people from Mexico so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh	3704	A
the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh	3704	A
you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and- and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country	3704	A
plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh	3704	A
you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted	3704	A
uh you know thirty years ago uh a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event	3704	A
and- and- and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i i'm not sure of that	3704	A
oh yeah	3704	A
that's right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event	3704	A
and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month they'd have a stroke	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
oh well- and you know microwaves	3704	A
oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have three televisions you know and i really they're two well	3704	A
one of them_1 is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in six months i mean it's there you know	3704	A
and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones	3704	A
um	3704	A
that's right that's right	3704	A
yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh	3704	A
issue i've run across a few people before that- that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know people look at them_1 yeah like yeah you know but-	3704	A
and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not	3704	A
okay Carolyn what kind of dress do you have to wear when you go to work	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
uh well in my company we do have to dress up and they don't say that you have to um dress in a dress for women but they strongly urge it	3701	A
so it's it's kind of an unwritten law	3701	A
right	3701	A
exactly it's puts puts forth a better image it's uh my company doesn't usually have casual days we had our first one in four at least since i've been there which is four years not too long ago and	3701	A
i didn't feel comfortable dressing like many people came in like warm ups and no and i	3701	A
yeah and i don't feel i- i wore you know a nice pair of pants and and blouse but i- i- i just couldn't feel comfortable in my warm ups around everybody at work	3701	A
oh well it was just recently so i don't know if they'll do it again the way some people looked i would doubt it	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
i don't know i it just seems if you want to get ahead or even if you just want everybody to think of you you know as a a professionally you you don't just want to have the real casual look all the time	3701	A
well we've got two hundred people in our office but we're the corporate office so um it's it's relatively large but i mean i have a job very much longer so i- i don't want to say too much	3701	A
exactly we have to hold the image for everybody	3701	A
i would like to you know i dress as nicely as my budget allows	3701	A
and and you know i mean it's it's a lot better than some people there and it's not as nice because i don't have the money of others you know what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
so you don't work with many women	3701	A
and i work with all women	3701	A
and my husband does well not all but the majority and my husband he works in a bank and he works with all women	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
at least at the lower levels you know	3701	A
okay	3701	A
what about season to season do you change	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
exactly i- i do the same and that's what basically keeps my wardrobe i may wear a few really warm dresses in the winter but i don't i don't change a whole lot because it's it's we're environmentally controlled you know	3701	A
you end up wearing the same thing	3701	A
below the knee	3701	A
i- i- i don't have nice knees they're kind of knobby so	3701	A
on the knobby side i what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
halfway up the knee	3701	A
you must have better	3701	A
oh okay-	3701	A
oh okay	3701	A
i- i- i'm thinking halfway between the knee and your say your hip	3701	A
well it that it is but i know a lot of women who who do wear those skirts and they have been reprimanded in our company before	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
also i was going to just mention that i wear what you know my my wardrobe- my wardrobe how should i say it i wear what i can fit into	3701	A
oh yeah fat months thin months you know	3701	A
exactly the same for me but i'm working on it but i'm not doing a very good job at this point	3701	A
i haven't gotten serious yet	3701	A
that's right that's right but i'm so used to eating now it's hard to get out of the habit	3701	A
uh i can actually wear anything i want to however i generally wear uh suits or dresses	3701	B
how about_1 you	3701	B
well the company that i work for uh we it's very casual we don't see any people there's a plant out in the back and then i'm in the office section	3701	B
and we always had casual day on Friday which meant you could wear jeans or whatever you wanted to which to me dressing down is you know like wearing pants and a jacket or something	3701	B
but uh	3701	B
even though i don't have to dress during the day you know in anything that dressy i still feel better i feel more professional when i'm dressed up	3701	B
you're kidding that's casual	3701	B
uh-huh	3701	B
would i assume that perhaps they did that one time and that was it	3701	B
well that's what i always thought actually uh the gals in our customer service department quite honestly came in every day in what i considered casual but	3701	B
um-hum do you work for a large company	3701	B
well and it and it affects uh you know being in the corporate office how you have to dress too do you	3701	B
do you tend to dress up toward your superiors as the books kind of	3701	B
i understand	3701	B
um-hum	3701	B
uh i have never i really have not worked for very many companies that i had a female role model	3701	B
um the we have some i'm sure in our corporate office but i've not met them yet but uh the last few jobs i've had well there was two jobs ago there was a girl in the office uh that i tended to try to emulate somewhat but uh	3701	B
no not too many	3701	B
i've	3701	B
do you really	3701	B
majority	3701	B
i'm sure that's true i used to be in banking and you're right the majority of the people there	3701	B
uh	3701	B
exactly-	3701	B
what oh someone never mind that's a call coming in but	3701	B
we'll pass that	3701	B
um i probably get a little bit more casual in summer	3701	B
in then in that i would wear a more casual top under some of my suits	3701	B
than i would wear in the winter	3701	B
but our offices are rather cold so i i'll tend to try to dress warmly too	3701	B
well tell me another thing	3701	B
uh how do you wear your skirt lengths	3701	B
well i they go from everywhere to just like halfway up the knee to uh mid calf	3701	B
not halfway not halfway up my leg halfway up my knee	3701	B
okay my half of my knee might	3701	B
uh and my	3701	B
really	3701	B
you mean you have fat days and thin days	3701	B
well right now i'm having a fat month i know half of my clothes don't fit me since the holiday season	3701	B
well we have to get all of this junk food out of the house from Christmas	3701	B
well	3701	B
yeah	3750	B
oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time	3750	B
except for what i call living now which is which is very close to camping yeah you know i i camped in the Boy Scouts and uh	3750	B
you know my dad and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because_1 i was in construction	3750	B
and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it	3750	B
and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous	3750	B
so my buddy and i we just camped and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it	3750	B
course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's a couple of years older than me and uh	3750	B
he graduated and went off to college and and during- during summer we'd camp out at the lake	3750	B
and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in the morning go skiing	3750	B
you know in in the afternoon you know it's still four o'clock you got four hours of day light good skiing left	3750	B
and uh it was great	3750	B
but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really	3750	B
oh yeah well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago we didn't have a phone	3750	B
and they didn't have phone lines i mean there was you just couldn't get a phone	3750	B
and uh we're on the we're third from the end on the electric string	3750	B
so uh and we're at the end of the mail route like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas	3750	B
but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home	3750	B
one of these twelve by forty eight's that got repaid	3750	B
and uh i swapped them_1 a Cadillac for it and uh put it out here on the land figuring i'd build a house some day you know i'm in construction and uh	3750	B
you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know	3750	B
and uh i came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was packed everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving	3750	B
and i said where she said out to the trailer and i said oh no she said yep i said okay	3750	B
so we've been uh roughing it out here about three years but it's not bad i we got color TV and microwave i mean you know it's not horrible but it's it's a lot like camping	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
sure	3750	B
became civilized	3750	B
yep my mom goes camping you know she she takes her uh motor home	3750	B
and but you know she has a lot of fun	3750	B
and mostly it's just a way to she she goes to dog shows see she shows dogs and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel	3750	B
and so she you know takes the motor home	3750	B
and she made a deal with my dad that she'd take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing and she but if he'd buy her a motor home so he did	3750	B
but as far as as camping my wife and i had plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the you know Highway One there in in California	3750	B
uh as soon as we get this house finished i'm gonna need a vacation	3750	B
okay so you enjoy camping	3750	A
yeah uh-huh	3750	A
uh-huh	3750	A

um so my dad loved fishing and camping so we'd go up first we went up just uh with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot dogs by the fire or whatever	3750	A
but then later my mom and dad got a camper so uh we've kind of moved up yeah a little bit in the world	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
no	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah oh that's a that'll be pretty that's really pretty out there	3750	A
so a lot of nice places	3750	A
Mark i was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time	3737	A
really have you had lessons guitar lessons	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band	3737	A
well and bad hours too	3737	A
huh well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i don't play very well but uh i wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as um	3737	A
i usually	3737	A
you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's Christmas time or a birthday or uh we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some	3737	A
um crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
that's true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
hum	3737	A
sounds like it	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
that's awful	3737	A
that's pretty funny well i uh since my kids started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a Pilgrim feast and things and so i've done some	3737	A
right so i've done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um	3737	A
it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at school and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest and read	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
hum	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
well and there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing	3737	A
hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um	3737	A
you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need	3737	A
uh-huh i like that	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
and it's	3737	A
right and it's functional so that you're always needing you know it's nice to do your Christmas cards	3737	A
yeah sounds good	3737	A
yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like um we've done a lot	3737	A
too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the garage a lot	3737	B
uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they weren't very good	3737	B
and uh so i didn't really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there	3737	B
yeah i was i was in several bands when i was	3737	B
some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because_1 they were all a little pig headed and	3737	B
self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves	3737	B
yeah yeah that too	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store	3737	B
so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself	3737	B
um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh	3737	B
if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that	3737	B
but uh	3737	B
it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything	3737	B
my my dad's gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh	3737	B
he didn't get it finished because_1 he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh	3737	B
he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over	3737	B
it's like Dad you're doing it wrong	3737	B
you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
and Halloween and	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah i i work- i work out of the i work at a Renaissance festival down in Waxahachie and uh	3737	B
i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh	3737	B
it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and	3737	B
kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it	3737	B
yeah like my mom sew has sewn for years and years and years and years and years	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah yeah	3737	B
one one one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy	3737	B
i i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and	3737	B
yeah you can do it yourself- do your Christmas cards and invitations and things like that	3737	B
or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall	3737	B
uh i i live in Richardson just outside of Dallas it snowed- snowed just-	3737	B
are you Bob	3751	A
oh okay i am in Waco	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
right down the street	3751	A
oh credit cards my favorite subject	3751	A
oh do i uh	3751	A
yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them_1 a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off	3751	A
and so then you have no money so you use a credit card	3751	A
so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is	3751	A
do you use them a lot	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
oh	3751	A
yeah yeah well that is a good idea	3751	A
that through a Visa	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
huh	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
yeah that is my problem i don't try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know so i have got myself	3751	A
exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now	3751	A
but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them	3751	A
so it is kind of strange	3751	A
oh yeah exactly like the government in	3751	A
in debt for	3751	A
yeah yeah	3751	A
have they put the cap on the interest rates	3751	A
i didn't know if they actually did that or not i know they were i know they were considering it	3751	A
uh-huh yeah	3751	A
funny how that works isn't it	3751	A
i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety	3751	A
i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it	3751	A
because of the economy yeah	3751	A
exactly	3751	A
i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting	3751	A
yeah i have a credit union	3751	A
yeah they do uh-huh	3751	A
yes i do yes i do a matter of fact	3751	A
uh i work for Channel six	3751	A
it's it's an NBC affiliate down here	3751	A
oh really	3751	A
oh okay where do you work what is your	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
so you probably work with uh	3751	A
uh what is the boy from here	3751	A
you ever work with Davis	3751	A
Davis Iron Work yeah	3751	A
oh okay and uh what else	3751	A
yeah well i live actually in Hewett	3751	A
yeah right outside so that is where Davis Iron Works is	3751	A
uh	3751	A
i don't think i have seen that one i am sure i pass by it or something but i am not sure	3751	A
huh Prime Air	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
okay	3751	A
have you ever been to Marlin	3751	A
i think it is Marlin or Mart they have uh	3751	A
uh a place i guess that would be similar to Prime Air it is called H G H or something like K G H or	3751	A
i can't think of i can't think of the name but	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
oh yeah	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
uh-huh oh i don't like that drive i make that drive sometimes we have stories out there but	3751	A
huh oh really i know	3751	A
oh goodness they they are bad at Hewett too on eighty four they are real bad that is where i got my last ticket	3751	A
so of course i couldn't pay that on a credit-	3751	A
i am in Plano where are you	3751	B
is that right oh okay	3751	B
you mean you use credit cards	3751	B
i bet you used them all up over Christmas	3751	B
and then your are in debt	3751	B
i understand that	3751	B
well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because_1 you get	3751	B
Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way	3751	B
so	3751	B
as long as you pay it off every month it doesn't cost you anything	3751	B
so	3751	B
that is what i	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
but uh	3751	B
i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh	3751	B
if i can get away with paying them_1 off every month it is alright if i don't then it gets expensive	3751	B
well you shouldn't do that you you- you- never- you- you- you never get out of the hole that way	3751	B
kind of like the federal government right	3751	B
never- never get out of debt	3751	B
and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right	3751	B
so	3751	B
no	3751	B
no	3751	B
just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so	3751	B
thou- thou who doesn't need credit gets cheap credit	3751	B
well i think so because the	3751	B
that's right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you	3751	B
we have a Master Card or Visa too	3751	B
you got that one	3751	B
who who do you work for	3751	B
oh	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
i do a lot of work down in Waco a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh	3751	B
Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there	3751	B
GNK	3751	B
Davis Iron yes yep matter of fact i just saw them last week yep	3751	B
are- are you in that part are you in the south part of town now	3751	B
oh yeah okay	3751	B
you know	3751	B
you know uh Parker Machine Tool down there	3751	B
Bobby Parker	3751	B
there is a place in Hewett called it is a new company called Prime Air	3751	B
that is in Hewett just around the corner from Davis Iron Works	3751	B
yeah they make uh	3751	B
humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for you know hospitals homes something like that it's a new kind-	3751	B
uh yeah	3751	B
oh really	3751	B
huh	3751	B
i will have to stop in there i went i have gone through there uh my oldest son goes to A&M and	3751	B
he is working on his Master's- the Navy sent him there for his Master's mostly in Engineering so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty five	3751	B
that is about the last time i have been through Marlin and Mart	3751	B
there is always a state trooper down there you have got to drive careful	3751	B
between Mart and Marlin they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour	3751	B
huh	3751	B
uh-huh	3751	B
okay_1	3713	A
uh do you cook quite a bit	3713	A
that's good practice though	3713	A
i know when i was single it was uh i wouldn't cook much of anything i think one night i sauteed a pound of mushrooms and that was dinner	3713	A
but uh well right now my husband and i live in uh uh subdivision that we have a dinner club {thingy}	3713	A
and what we do is once a month we'll meet at one house and the host will prepare the entree and provide the drinks and then every one else brings something	3713	A
and then it rotates from month to month you get together with four couples so you only host one time	3713	A
it is really nice but uh	3713	A
well	3713	A
we haven't but i think that'd be great you know do Mexican one time or Chinese the next time thinking the next one we get into that i'll do that	3713	A
but basically the host so far have just been picking you know what we have and then they'll let the people know and they'll uh uh ask people to bring something to compliment it but personally i like to prepare something that i could have done ahead of time	3713	A
because i can't talk and cook at the same time uh if i try you know i- i leave ingredients out but uh	3713	A
we're suppose to be hosting next time i'm thinking of about having beef stroganoff because i can do that ahead of time	3713	A
and	3713	A
really	3713	A
now- now is this one of the dishes that you cook	3713	A
it's really simple so don't don't let it uh	3713	A
what do you cook when you go home	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
no what is it	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
that doesn't bother me anyway so	3713	A
oh you sound like my husband he's a garlic freak too	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
do you uh stir fry	3713	A
do you have a wok	3713	A
well i'd call them up	3713	A
probably works just as well	3713	A
that's something you know we don't do all that often and every time we do it i think why don't we cook this way more often because it is healthy you get a lot of vegetables and everything	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
soy sauce	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
uh-huh	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
uh not really actually uh i live by myself and so most of my cooking is pretty basic you know just for myself but i cook when i go home my mom doesn't like to cook so	3713	B
i cook all my parents' meals when i go home and that's about_1 the only opportunity i like to but i just you know	3713	B
hard to get motivated to cook for yourself	3713	B
yeah	3713	B
oh	3713	B
oh	3713	B
that's pretty nice	3713	B
well what kind of things do you usually have i mean do you do you usually have like	3713	B
you know ethnic food do you try a different thing every time or	3713	B
oh sure	3713	B
oh yeah	3713	B
oh yeah my mom does that and freezes it a lot of times	3713	B
yeah	3713	B
huh-uh	3713	B
one of my mom's bailiwick	3713	B
i was going to say i kind of i do not know i do	3713	B
odd things i guess	3713	B
um i guess last time i was home was at Christmas and i cooked um	3713	B
i bought some really good beef tenderloin at um Ralph's in Snider Plaza	3713	B
and um i had i my parents have a deep freeze so i bought like oh God i want to say it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze and so i cooked one of them you know and	3713	B
basically have you ever used that DV sauce	3713	B
it's like um	3713	B
a meat a beef enhancer or something like that	3713	B
i mean it might not i- i haven't really looked at the ingredients and it may be one of those things where if if	3713	B
it may have MSG in it i really haven't really looked i do not think it does but it might but	3713	B
uh you know i kind of like sprinkle some of that on it and then take like	3713	B
you know pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them_1 down into the meat	3713	B
and then yeah and then bake it you know and it it always turns out really good i mean course you know the better the the the quality of the meat the better it turns out but	3713	B
you know and if you can leave it out on the counter for a little bit and you know to soak in the the garlic and everything you know that works pretty well but you know that's kind of that's kind of basic and i can do some Chinese and junk like that but	3713	B
some sometimes um i had one but i loaned it to somebody and they never gave it back	3713	B
so i kind of just use a skillet really	3713	B
oh yeah	3713	B
sure and the easy see now that would be an easy thing to do for the dinner party because you could do that in advance you know you i would just get like um	3713	B
you could use do chicken or beef either one and you know kind of chop it up into about inch cubes you know and the marinade i think that is like um	3713	B
oh like a cup of water and maybe three tablespoons of	3713	B
soy and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worcestershire- Worcestershire Worcestershire- or whatever sauce i can't pronounce it	3713	B
i always call it Lea and Perrins because_1 i can't say the name of it and uh garlic and chopped green onions and then you know chop up all of your meat like the night before and stick it in a tupperware dish with the	3713	B
you know with the stuff and let it marinade over night and then just strain out you know the juice and um	3713	B
you know then then you know stir fry the meat and um you can get the cans of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and	3713	B
you can put mushroom	3713	B
think of the job benefits you have	3789	A
the dental insurance	3789	A
um do you work for TI	3789	A
okay hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
hum	3789	A
yeah	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
hm that does sound pretty bogus	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
hm	3789	A
that sounds kind of strange	3789	A
who's your- who's your dental care through	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
um	3789	A
ours is through uh Cigna	3789	A
and it's not too bad i mean i haven't	3789	A
i haven't been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits	3789	A
and uh they haven't- been bad they haven't uh they've been pretty good how about_1 your uh do you have an HMO or	3789	A
you you went to like a regular plan	3789	A
oh okay	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
did it get expensive or	3789	A
um-hum um-hum	3789	A
um-hum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh i personally i- i think HMO's are {scammy} now just because_1 uh it's only five dollars a visit every time i go that's not bad okay and it's five dollars prescription	3789	A
every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway	3789	A
but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking	3789	A
you know and	3789	A
so if i go to make a like i- i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache- i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor	3789	A
and they wouldn't let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just- just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and i'm	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
well i was just really annoyed with them_1 because_1 i uh i- i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you don't give me an appointment i'm just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill	3789	A
before anything happens they're like well wait another day and call us back and i'm like i don't wanna wait another day i want an appointment now	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
yeah it's it's real handy once you're you know if you like my roommate broke his arm	3789	A
and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that	3789	A
and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like	3789	A
i don't know i'm i'm only twenty four years old you know i don't really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years i've only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical	3789	A
so you know for me	3789	A
you know i don't i don't see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know	3789	A
so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible	3789	A
i guess i could've done pretty good with the five dollar visit	3789	A
so	3789	A
wow that's a lot	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
hum yeah Kaiser's- expensive i mean i think it's uh this year it's like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars	3789	A
yeah that works- that works out pretty handy	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
no yeah	3789	A
it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best	3789	A
well i- i think uh so far they've been pretty- pretty good except the medical uh	3789	B
not not the medical the dental insurance	3789	B
yeah i- yeah i think um	3789	B
i know i went to have a tooth pulled	3789	B
and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldn't uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing condition	3789	B
you know how you wait you wait as long as you can	3789	B
sometimes to- to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it really- i- i just thought that was that was pretty bad	3789	B
and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell- fell off and uh	3789	B
they paid for the the cap but they wouldn't pay for the build up	3789	B
and i didn't understand that either	3789	B
uh well uh it's it's a part of Aetna	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
well i had an HMO up to this year i switched	3789	B
yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh	3789	B
you know because	3789	B
yeah it's gotten expensive because_1 right now i'm i'm only- i only have myself so i don't have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
really	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
right	3789	B
right	3789	B
right	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah that was a problem that i had with them_1 toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and	3789	B
and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away	3789	B
and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them_1 i got okay but uh and i didn't go back	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah that's what i thought about later i would've probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
right	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah after i really thought about it some more the i- i really could've done that but um	3789	B
i was hospitalized uh	3789	B
uh about_1 three years ago i had some surgery	3789	B
and Kaiser was really good for that because_1 i didn't have to pay any of it at all	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
wow	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
well my uh my Kaiser premium	3789	B
would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year	3789	B
and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
so i went back to Aetna because i- i won't have to pay anything	3789	B
and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick	3789	B
you know	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
where in California you live	3708	B
okay i was down that way once but i don't think i remember that is it on the coast	3708	B
i went all the way down to Imperial Beach once that's far as i went	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yes i guess we're gonna talk about camping is that right	3708	B
okay	3708	B
well yeah my wife and i like to camp um usually just on short trips like a weekend or long weekend	3708	B
and we generally go to uh State or National parks	3708	B
uh-huh yeah well we don't really care for fishing anything that that resembles work uh so we just uh what we do is hike and take pictures that's about all	3708	B
well Texas has a pretty nice system of state parks we've got um state parks just all over the place on different kinds of terrain and most of them	3708	B
uh	3708	B
well Texas has every thing from desert to uh swamp so i don't think they have too many	3708	B
they don't have too many swamps in Arizona i don't think i don't think i've uh seen too many swamps in Arizona	3708	B
now we may do some camping- camping in Arizona though i've got uh my uh brother and sister and father all live in Sedonia now Sedonia yeah	3708	B
what is it	3708	B
Mayer	3708	B
oh yeah uh	3708	B
i- i think i remember going through there is that between Prescott and Jerome or over the other way	3708	B
uh-huh well it be	3708	B
yeah i think i do remember a little wide place in the road called Mayer well anyway they uh everybody there says that you know there are places you can camp uh right around Sedonia there are	3708	B
yeah	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yeah well we we do we like actually we like to get off uh where there aren't too many people around	3708	B
we did find a nice uh prospect uh down on the gulf	3708	B
um there's a uh national wildlife- wildlife refuge called Urandus i don't know if you've heard of it that's where the whooping cranes go in the winter or at least where a lot of them go	3708	B
and uh there's and island right off that called Matagorda and uh you can take a ferry boat out there and it's uh completely uh pretty much anyway complete wilderness island	3708	B
sort of like a big sand bar you know you wanna make sure there aren't any big storms coming	3708	B
but uh then you can uh take a uh take a little bus across the island to the to the gulf side rather than the bay side and uh	3708	B
it's really nice out there lots of sea birds	3708	B
all at once or all at once	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yeah well i sort of like to feel less tied down rather than more tied down when i go camping and	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
well i really like Arizona i like uh uh couple times this last year i've made it up to Jerome just to enjoy the altitude and everything and it's really	3708	B
neat up there somehow	3708	B
i met the town historian	3708	B
uh it's near National- it's near uh San Diego it's called National City	3708	A
yeah it's just a little rinky-dink town but	3708	A
most people don't go there it's really not a good neighborhood	3708	A
yeah it's nicer down there	3708	A
unfortunately i need to be near near the naval base so	3708	A
my choice of living quarters is limited so um are you ready to begin	3708	A
right	3708	A
okay i'll push the button hang on	3708	A
{alrighty} there we go	3708	A
so do you go camping at all	3708	A
yeah my husband and i like going for the long weekends we usually like going up to one of the camping grounds that have a lake near it	3708	A
because_1 we like to fish and camp	3708	A
yeah i- i like hiking unfortunately around here there's not too many spots to do stuff like that	3708	A
yeah i'm from Arizona and they've got a lot of it there too	3708	A
they've also got desert desert uh i don't know what you call it but	3708	A
sites in the desert they have a special name for it	3708	A
i don't think i'd like the swamp but mountains and deserts	3708	A
huh	3708	A
no it's pretty much dry	3708	A
oh really do you know where Mayer's at	3708	A
Mayer outside Prescott	3708	A
yeah	3708	A
over the other way it's actually if you blinked you'd miss it	3708	A
oh there's a lot of beautiful camping places around Sedonia and they're getting they're getting more of them_1	3708	A
they're just doing it slowly but surely	3708	A
but um i like the rustic kind of camping	3708	A
yeah	3708	A
uh-huh	3708	A
oh that'd be neat	3708	A
really	3708	A
right	3708	A
that sounds like it'd be nice	3708	A
yeah unfortunately my husband and i haven't been able to go camping because_1 i just had two kids two- two boys and	3708	A
huh	3708	A
well no no i spaced them out about a year a part	3708	A
but until they get a little bit older we really don't want to take them_1 out camping with us	3708	A
yeah when i go camping i like to get out and hike and do things and when you have little kids you really can't do that very much	3708	A
right that's the object of it you know get out and feel free and do things you don't normally get to do	3708	A
but um yeah we haven't got to go lately but when we go we we're from Arizona so when we go back on vacation next year we'll get to go	3708	A
which should be nice	3708	A
it is actually	3708	A
well i suppose we both have credit cards	3781	B
yeah	3781	B
well i do use them um	3781	B
i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i- i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to	3781	B
um	3781	B
but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh	3781	B
they all can build up	3781	B
uh i think they're handy i just get	3781	B
uh i don't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks	3781	B
when you go shopping	3781	B
well do you use credit cards	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
your grandmother huh	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
that's good	3781	B
oh that's that's wonderful	3781	B
well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing it's really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building	3781	B
but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
um yeah	3781	B
well that's good i'm looking right now i'm kind- kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them_1 have gotten higher	3781	B
and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a	3781	B
Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didn't write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think it's eighteen percent or something so	3781	B
think i want to find something that has a lower rate	3781	B
no i haven't	3781	B
is is that the one from Sears	3781	B
okay	3781	B
okay	3781	B
uh-huh oh	3781	B
oh they give you money back for using your credit card	3781	B
oh i didn't know that	3781	B
hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards	3781	B
i worked with- at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take	3781	B
until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so	3781	B
you know now they'll take the Discover but i still don't know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard	3781	B
but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and	3781	B
American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two	3781	B
um-hum yeah i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldn't be able to use them	3781	B
but uh i- i do like my Dillard's i have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop	3781	B
and i do- do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores	3781	B
but	3781	B
well yes no not too much more about credit cards	3781	B
okay well	3781	B
good talking to you Beth	3781	B
good luck	3781	B
you too bye	3781	B
um-hum yeah they seem to be a part of life	3781	A
yeah how do you use them	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah i use a few i um	3781	A
i watched my grandmother go into debt on them and so i've and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so	3781	A
basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um	3781	A
i generally and my husband it turns out i've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month	3781	A
so that we don't pay any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
yeah yeah that's what i feel	3781	A
so	3781	A
um-hum it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them_1 in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come but sometimes i forget and	3781	A
so you know a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um	3781	A
yeah have you ever used Discover card	3781	A
yeah i'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off but you know	3781	A
um i think Sears originally put it out but it's um it's pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take Discover	3781	A
and there's no annual service fee which is good you know and then um	3781	A
they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back	3781	A
yeah basically that's it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but i'm not sure	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah i think it's best to keep the number down that you have	3781	A
so	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
well do you have anything else to say or	3781	A
okay i don't think i do either so well it was good talking to you	3781	A
okay have a good evening bye-bye	3781	A
do you	3707	B
how old is it	3707	B
uh you you're you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think	3707	B
well	3707	B
i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh i've had dogs through the years right now i've got two	3707	B
and three cats but	3707	B
uh and uh my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix and we watched it this summer for two to three months and it wasn't trained quite fully either	3707	B
and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog	3707	B
i don't know i i'm old fashioned and when i got my my dogs when they when they did something i hollered at them_1 and threw them_1 outside they say that's not the way to do it now but you're just supposed to	3707	B
no just just you- put them_1 outside i guess unless you catch- catch them_1 in the act	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
no you- no you don't wanna do that but uh	3707	B
does- does- does it just wanna sniff around and	3707	B
does it just wanna sniff around and play when it's outside	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
have- have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
that's nothing huh	3707	B
well it it it'll it'll catch on pretty soon i'll i'll i'll {betcha} i i have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever and she's gone the other way because she's so old she doesn't have much control	3707	B
so we're battling with that problem and she still feels good uh she can't hear worth a darn or see very well but she's got a great appetite and she knows we're there by smell	3707	B
she'll be sixteen in May	3707	B
and yeah but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years so we're putting up with all her accidents	3707	B
um-hum	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
does it oh	3707	B
uh-huh	3707	B
uh you know maybe you need- you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes	3707	B
oh	3707	B
well you know where we went we went to the junior college Richland	3707	B
and we took my my daughter was living at home then and she took our Golden Retriever or not the Golden Retriever the Norwegian Elk Hound over there and	3707	B
it it it's a pretty good class and they did pretty good except this dog is she's just pretty she's not smart so she didn't learn a lot but it i think it calmed her down a little bit and she's used to being around other dogs now	3707	B
i think it was like a six week program	3707	B
uh i think it was one night a week for like six weeks and uh you know it was a group class outside	3707	B
it was fairly reasonable too	3707	B
yeah they're pretty- they're usually a high strung dog aren't they	3707	B
um our our friend has a	3707	B
uh we have a Sheltie Collie a miniature Sheltie	3707	A
yeah it's about oh about_1 six months old	3707	A
and we're trying- we're we- we live in an apartment so we don't have a yard so it has to stay- stay- stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it	3707	A
it's about six months	3707	A
really	3707	A
but they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs but i guess every one one every one one of them_1 or or every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because_1 this one isn't	3707	A
um-hum	3707	A
yeah	3707	A
so how'd y'all how do you what's the best method	3707	A
right	3707	A
stand outside with them_1 until they	3707	A
well we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult and	3707	A
you know you don't wanna you don't wanna spank it or scare it or anything like that so	3707	A
yeah we we try to take it	3707	A
you know it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside and you know and then it runs right inside and it does it huh	3707	A
yeah a lot of times and you know it it won't it's whole job outside and it comes inside	3707	A
uh yeah we've tried that and uh	3707	A
you know there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go so and he chews on plants and all that but you know that's natural for a little puppy huh	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
oh that's sad	3707	A
huh	3707	A
how old is it	3707	A
man that's sad	3707	A
oh of course not	3707	A
i couldn't	3707	A
that is really sad what what's the deal we- we try to we're trying to take it on walks now you know	3707	A
and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash	3707	A
and so it i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it i mean it just goes like a mad dog i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and	3707	A
it's you know i mean it's not even close to even being trained on a leash	3707	A
um-hum well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they	3707	A
sometimes misuse- misuse their	3707	A
license or whatever you know and they treat them_1 bad	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
uh-huh	3707	A
how long did it take	3707	A
every what	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
well Sheltie Collies are you know timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and	3707	A
yeah yeah and uh if they're not accustomed to something they they're really scared so	3707	A
family with children or	3741	A
oh do you	3741	A
so what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them	3741	A
that's true and then you just get to spoil the grandkids and send them home right that's what my mom always says	3741	A
yeah i have one little daughter she's just a year and a half	3741	A
and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like	3741	A
she's not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing her attention span's only a couple of minutes i think and then its on to the new little mess	3741	A
i'm sure you remember those days	3741	A
but and we try and sit and read to her she's really good she'll bring us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff but	3741	A
i can't they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else	3741	A
or else she loses her loses a attention- the attention's not that interesting to her for very long	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
uh	3741	A
uh	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
oh yeah	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
uh-huh and it	3741	A
yeah i- i uh my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and	3741	A
i i've carried it through i love to read now and and uh that's why we've we've made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we don't you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that	3741	A
that uh it's something good to do but	3741	A
yeah it's it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and it's the same one over and over and over again it seems like but	3741	A
but i guess like you say she it's something so she at least she gets in the habit	3741	A
but	3741	A
yeah we uh my wife works at a day care part time and she's able to take her with her there but she she works with a lot of kids whose parents you know it's they drop them_1 off at six in the morning and then pick them_1 up at six at night and	3741	A
then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder	3741	A
you know there's	3741	A
there's a lot to be said with- with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids that's for sure	3741	A
other than just you know putting them in front of the TV or something like that	3741	A
i have a kind of a hard time with that but	3741	A
it's uh i think it's fair to say you get more of a there's a lot more love and they don't have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the parents are spending time doing stuff with them	3741	A
so	3741	A
how many children did you have- do you have	3741	A
three and how many grandchildren	3741	A
eight oh that's good	3741	A
yeah we uh my mom and dad just well they have three grandchildren now each of my brother and sister each we each have one but	3741	A
they're they're fond of like i say they like to keep them_1 for a couple of hours but boy when they send them home with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death	3741	A
they like them_1 but	3741	A
uh they they're looking forward they like i say they've been looking forward to the time when they could just send them_1 home with their with their parents as opposed to having to keep us all the time	3741	A
so	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
yeah well how do you do	3741	A
how did you do that i mean you know as far as having to tell them_1 no or slapping their hands or something like that that's that's what we struggle with	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah well that's the important thing and they probably appreciate all you did for them_1 so	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
we're just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my mom is just you wait you know you'll get all that you ever gave so i could be in trouble but	3741	A
i say they they're a handful that's for sure we i just last night uh she	3741	A
uh yes in fact i'm i'm i've got grandchildren	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
uh spending uh	3741	B
oh just visiting back and forth fortunately when your children get up in their thirties	3741	B
they finally grow up you get to enjoy them	3741	B
right right right	3741	B
yeah do you have children	3741	B
oh	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
oh yeah	3741	B
oh yeah yeah	3741	B
um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah i- i think one of the very most important	3741	B
was i- i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to read to them	3741	B
uh and get them to love books	3741	B
before they ever start to preschool	3741	B
uh	3741	B
i was very fortunate in having an older sister who read to me constantly and uh so i was i went to school in the days before public kindergarten	3741	B
but uh uh i had practically all the fairy stories read to me before i started to school so	3741	B
uh i uh i made great strides and i i'm sure you'll experience the same thing	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
oh yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah yeah	3741	B
um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
i have three three yeah	3741	B
uh eight	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah yeah yeah	3741	B
i i think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause some days when you're feeling pretty good you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder then on days when you don't feel well	3741	B
what do you mean you didn't do this	3741	B
oh oh gee i- i- i- i did a lot of the wrong things i'm sure	3741	B
but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if	3741	B
i i tried to keep as few rules but well really about the only rule i had was they couldn't play on the top bunk and they had to confine their eating to the kitchen	3741	B
so	3741	B
yeah yeah and uh so	3741	B
uh	3741	B
i don't know they all turned around- out okay so	3741	B
well i- i think so and um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um well i have i have two kids in school and	3757	B
and in comparing it with people who live in other parts of the world one of the things that- things wrong is that our our schools our kids seem to go to school less	3757	B
of- of the year than than kids in other countries	3757	B
um it seems like uh the long summer break is something that	3757	B
only	3757	B
uh only occurs in the United States	3757	B
um do you have any kids in school	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
well some of the- some of the uh schools are trying to go to more of a year around system	3757	B
and uh i guess there's pros and cons to that too i know if if if it happened here i would hope that uh you know i have uh two children that are two years a part i would just hope they were in the same system so	3757	B
if you wanna take a vacation you could	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
it could it could one of the other um things is that um	3757	B
uh there's been a lot of talk about uh American schools uh getting behind in science compared to uh lot of European schools and and Japan also	3757	B
that their schools are teaching uh more of the science sciences and putting out better	3757	B
uh graduates when in math and science uh for the future you know technology in various countries	3757	B
and that's not a favorite subject for either of my my kids it's probably not	3757	B
for anyone but it just seems like uh those are the criticisms criticisms you hear over and over about the the the American public school system and this is probably why a lot people go to private schools instead	3757	B
some of the some of the people that i work with uh they're they're some from various parts of the of the world and and uh course everybody likes to think their system's the best but the the ones in	3757	B
England and and then Germany seem seem to uh have some logical points about	3757	B
you know why do why do kids need a three month break in the summer	3757	B
and i i think that dates back to	3757	B
when America was agricultural and nature and and children needed to help on farms and it's been quite a while since that's been the case for most part now	3757	B
and it seems though that's one of the things that ought to to change	3757	B
uh i'm not i'm not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and	3757	B
and uh Christmas time for the other you know the other one	3757	B
and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with uh families going on vacation	3757	B
tends to make some crowds	3757	B
did you go through the public school system	3757	B
uh uh uh yeah i did too and everyone else in my family but seems like uh	3757	B
uh if people can afford it the number of people go the private school route but that's of course not available to to the average person with	3757	B
yes uh-huh	3757	B
that i have mixed feelings about that too i guess whether or not they miss the social interaction a part of it	3757	B
yeah that that would help	3757	B
yeah uh-huh	3757	B
yeah the i i think that's why a lot of people go to the home schooling they they disagree with what they're exposed to either for religious reasons or or other reasons	3757	B
um	3757	B
the other thing that's happening now i guess is is	3757	B
well Tom what do you think about our public school systems today	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
no i don't	3757	A
so i'm a little bit out of it i can look back to my to when i was in school which is getting further and further away and also i have a niece and nephew that are in school out in California and i hear a little a bit about from my sister about	3757	A
things going on yeah	3757	A
yeah they're moving to that out there	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
uh-huh i hear that they that in at least in the system that's going out um in California where that i'm familiar with that they do put families on the same schedule	3757	A
so seems like that could get a little difficult to do that but	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah yeah	3757	A
yeah well i hadn't thought about those things but those are problems um	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
right	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah there's no need for it anymore	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
right yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah i did	3757	A
right i know a lot of people that are home schooling their children you know just teaching them at home and	3757	A
and for lots of different reasons you know	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
i know that a lot of them um they hook up with like a home schooling system and they get together the kids get together for lots of activities and outings and stuff like that	3757	A
yeah i think that helps yeah i wonder too i have mixed feelings about it but um	3757	A
i know that uh you know i spot when i thought of problems in the school system it's not really the fault of the school system but there's a lot of	3757	A
you know it's just uh	3757	A
i don't know kids are exposed to a lot that you can't shelter them eventually- eventually but it's hard at a young age some of the pressures and	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
it was Lee right yeah Lee what-	3765	B
i'm Bob	3765	B
you know the Arabs world doesn't do a lot of the things i like but they don't have too many repeat offenders- offenders in drugs and murder and a few other things	3765	B
you steal they cut off the hand you steal again they cut off both hands it takes care of it quick	3765	B
it takes care of it quick	3765	B
uh two wrongs don't make a right	3765	B
yeah	3765	B
yeah in Texas uh some private enterprise built a few prisons or jails	3765	B
and with- with the hope that the over flow from the county or the state would kind of get to them_1	3765	B
but uh see the evidently the counties and the cities are too scared to use them_1 because_1 of the expense but uh they're having trouble now paying their bills because_1 they're not getting any customers	3765	B
i don't understand that	3765	B
years ago i sat on a rape trial and we let the guy off wasn't enough evidence although i'm sure he did it	3765	B
um-hum	3765	B
i think you need to get tough with them_1 and quit calling them_1 i don't think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor manual-	3765	B
and as tough as you can make it no coddling no kissing their and nothing- nothing just say hey you committed a wrong and you're going to serve some hard hard time	3765	B
and uh	3765	B
there in San Francisco you have a interesting place called the Delancy Street House have you heard of it	3765	B
hum	3765	B
we was talking to somebody the other day over there in Japan uh	3765	B
they have a very low crime problem	3765	B
and one of the things they do to them_1 in Japan is they publish the name and address	3765	B
and families of the person convicted of a crime and there is such embarrassment to the family that they have to move out of the neighborhood and move to another part of the country	3765	B
well- well our family sense of family has eroded i'm afraid in this country but	3765	B
i don't think it'll work here but over there the the way they're doing it it seems to be effective	3765	B
i've heard that i've heard that no i haven't	3765	B
uh	3765	B
terribly expensive yeah	3765	B
it's Lee	3765	A
uh and you're Bob	3765	A
uh	3765	A
i've been uh	3765	A
thinking about the topic and i think it's uh	3765	A
going to be interesting to see what happens as the criminal justice system	3765	A
responds to the tremendous	3765	A
i guess over load in	3765	A
uh cases they say that these drug cases	3765	A
alone are swamping the criminal justice system	3765	A
i've	3765	A
i've heard that i've heard that uh	3765	A
yeah i've even heard that the other end of the continuum some judges who are arguing that uh because the system is so over loaded that	3765	A
uh they recommend decriminalizing some of these things because the courts can't possibly handle all the cases	3765	A
i think its going to be very interesting because its uh	3765	A
it's really become a major expense for us as a society	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
well you know the other-	3765	A
the other thing that i think is interesting about this is that they've been experimenting for years in the civil justice system with alternatives to courts where you can rent a judge and i'm wondering whether we'll eventually go to renting a jury	3765	A
um and finding ways uh like The People's Court to try some of these cases	3765	A
i think uh the expense is is enormous have you ever sat on a jury	3765	A
yeah well it's uh	3765	A
it's it's a major undertaking i mean people have to give up their work and and a lot of their time	3765	A
and uh i- i just think it can overwhelm us pretty easily uh when i hear what people are saying about just the sheer volume of the cases	3765	A
well there are a lot of people who think that that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh	3765	A
it's push come to shove time as far as i can tell in terms of the sheer volume of this stuff	3765	A
yeah oh yeah it's well known and and it's consistent with what you're talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess	3765	A
you know we're going to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system	3765	A
um	3765	A
it's gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh	3765	A
the topic is an interesting one because of the um	3765	A
uh the price you pay for freedom i guess	3765	A
you know the the requirement that that people be given a trial and and	3765	A
and then then the issue becomes what do you do once somebody's found guilty i suppose	3765	A
yeah-	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
yeah have you uh in Dallas uh seen the newspapers ever print the names of people who were uh uh uh picked up as johns uh in under cover operations	3765	A
they they they've done that in San Francisco and uh you know it's gonna be interesting to see how all these things change as as we look at the cost of it because	3765	A
um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybody's entitled to a lawyer but not everybody's entitled to a doctor and we must spend	3765	A
i don't know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we're talking about are going to contribute to change and i don't know uh	3765	A
okay what do you think	3719	A
right um-hum	3719	A
yeah the class sizes are too large and they don't pay the teachers enough	3719	A
like in Dallas they have too many administrators they're top-heavy	3719	A
and uh they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the	3719	A
the text	3719	A
having um mistakes in them_1	3719	A
and uh a lot of them_1 aren't like the history books aren't historically correct they they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened	3719	A
well i think they need to	3719	A
do whatever they can like um i think	3719	A
um Massachusetts put a priority on education and and um	3719	A
bringing in industry and recruiting	3719	A
and they made a lot of difference in that state and in Texas i think we're like twenty ninth in spending	3719	A
you know and they put through this Robin Hood bill but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly	3719	A
and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to um make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because_1 most of the time the teachers spend	3719	A
disciplining the the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now	3719	A
so	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
yeah	3719	A
and uh i i think they changed the way the ladder is now that it takes a longer time for- for you to qualify for a higher salary and uh it's it's um	3719	A
it's more subjective than it was before	3719	A
so	3719	A
i don't know you know i don't know what incentive teacher has to stay in teaching	3719	A
i just have uh one daughter she's six now she's going to Richardson Public Schools	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
right	3719	A
right but the worst school districts are Dallas Garland Carrollton	3719	A
um Coppell really doesn't matter much it's it's is not at the bottom and the best is uh Highland Park Richardson and Plano	3719	A
she's six	3719	A
yeah	3719	A
and you know and she's learning to read so and she can do a little bit of math now so	3719	A
oh uh Valley View Mall	3719	A
oh yeah there's supposed to all- all the calls are supposed to be from a different phone so	3719	A
that's where i am and they have a lot of pay phones here so	3719	A
you know	3719	A
and i and i don't know uh uh they cut back on the since Mark White passed that bill about	3719	A
cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit	3719	A
because um	3719	A
i was talking to a lady the other day and that that's the first thing she said her her both her children were in band and they'd quit	3719	A
and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend- spend all of his time on band	3719	A
right and he he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the Lewisville School District	3719	A
and uh you know it's just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that	3719	A
everything should be equal you know and there's no reason you already spend all that time in band there's no reason that he should practice more than an hour a day outside of band if he if he even has the energy especially in marching season	3719	A
you know	3719	A
right and and what do you do when you are taking calculus and uh chemistry and physics two and	3719	A
something wrong with our school systems yes	3719	B
nobody wants to go to public schools um	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
just- what do you think can be done about that	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i agree	3719	B
i've got a friend who's uh a very talented teacher and has given it up	3719	B
uh in Carrollton uh just because_1 it's not i mean she just can't stand the paper work um	3719	B
you know it's uh	3719	B
and she's not paid enough she gets more as a filing claims for an insurance company which she's not even trained to do	3719	B
so	3719	B
i think it's real discouraging	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i don't either	3719	B
well do you have children	3719	B
out of the Dallas School District	3719	B
basically	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i don't have any but if i did i don't know that i could i would want them to be in a Dallas School District	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
how old is your daughter	3719	B
so she's just started this year	3719	B
where are you speaking from i can hear a lot of background noise	3719	B
oh	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
wow that is funny	3719	B
well	3719	B
um-hum	3719	B
um-hum	3719	B
and demanded the children right	3719	B
uh-huh	3719	B
hm	3719	B
well that goes along with football though too you know uh	3719	B
all righty	3732	A
so how- what do you think of capital punishment	3732	A
oh does it	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
well i feel that way the only exception i think is qualifies for capital punishment is repeat offenders where the offender actually murders people repeatedly	3732	A
like serial killers or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge and then gotten out on parole i don't think they should be able to get out on parole and do it again	3732	A
that's the only time i think it's really	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
yeah exactly	3732	A
and i think i think those types of people deserve capital punishment	3732	A
but i think they should restrict it strictly for repeat offenders or like i said serial killers because i mean a lot of times- not a lot of times but quite- quite a few times they've convicted innocent people on the first time	3732	A
but you know if they've been convicted like three times you know there something's wrong	3732	A
so i think that's the only time it's really a necessary	3732	A
uh	3732	A
the guilty party	3732	A
right	3732	A
but that's really the only time when i agree with it	3732	A
most of the time i don't think it's a good idea because_1 like you said there have been cases where they've convicted the wrong people	3732	A
just because of circumstances	3732	A
but in Arizona which is where i'm originally from	3732	A
they had a big thing about capital punishment there because we had like two serial killers within six months caught	3732	A
and they had a big thing about whether they should you know go for capital punishment or not but it's not used in Arizona	3732	A
so they had a problem with it	3732	A
unfortunately all the people got was sent to jail for a couple of years until they get paroled	3732	A
unfortunately one of them_1 killed a friend of mine so i was very much involved	3732	A
and when he got out on parole i was like	3732	A
go ahead get out on parole	3732	A
and	3732	A
after that i had i had to tangle with him and the police caught him the second time and they still wouldn't do anything except send him to jail so	3732	A
i definitely believe if they're repeat offenders they should	3732	A
be	3732	A
something to be done with them_1 other than just sitting there for two years and then getting out and doing it again	3732	A
but a lot of states have outlawed capital punishment	3732	A
i don't know which states in general	3732	A
oh really	3732	A
hum	3732	A
huh i didn't know that	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
really	3732	A
hum i didn't know that	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
but	3732	A
i don't know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays it's like i think people have to be off the wall to do them_1 but	3732	A
i still don't believe capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders	3732	A
but	3732	A
i don't know i	3732	A
once i finish law school i'll have	3732	A
more probably more views on it	3732	A
i'll be able to do something about it then	3732	A
oh do they	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
that would be the more humane way of doing it	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
or stuck in a gas chamber until they finally pass on	3732	A
but i know a couple of states	3732	A
still believe in the hanging but	3732	A
i don't i don't go for that either	3732	A
well Texas has capital punishment	3732	B
yep and uh	3732	B
they go through a set of appeals that lasts seven years	3732	B
and uh	3732	B
there are so many cases here like Sixty Minutes is on right now here there are so many cases here where they proved that they've convicted the wrong person	3732	B
that i'm against it they should just give them_1 life in prison	3732	B
right	3732	B
yeah exactly	3732	B
right uh-huh	3732	B
well like in your state Charles Manson	3732	B
or the guy who killed all those children	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
right	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
something's going on right	3732	B
yeah i think so too after after it's gone that far then they pretty well have a	3732	B
enough proof that that person's	3732	B
they can't be rehabilitated- rehabilitated either so yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
right i never heard about those	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
right	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
and that's that's the reason that Ted Bundy supposedly went to Florida	3732	B
that was his primary goal was to to have the death penalty	3732	B
because he started out in Washington and Oregon and traveled all the way across the country	3732	B
they had um	3732	B
Mark Harmon played him they had a movie about it a few years ago	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
and then of course there was a lot of publicity about it um the days before they killed him	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
so	3732	B
and he was really you know he was off the wall so	3732	B
right	3732	B
and-	3732	B
yeah and some of the ways i think that um the way that Texas um executes the prisoners is probably the most humane way they use- they do it by injection	3732	B
yeah instead of you know the electric chair the gas chamber that's	3732	B
you know	3732	B
yeah well they you know they just go to sleep and and then eventually they die	3732	B
instead of being you know fried or	3732	B
or	3732	B
yeah fighting fighting for breath right um-hum	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
okay you ready to discuss the the topic	3738	A
okay the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago	3738	A
are you ready for that okay pardon me	3738	A
okay well uh there's uh it's kind of an interesting- interesting topic and one that i think is quite fascinating because	3738	A
uh couple of years ago i guess uh not very not many- not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the United States but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was	3738	A
basically in a	3738	A
you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing	3738	A
you know you had the the Russians against the Americans the Communists against the Free World	3738	A
and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where	3738	A
uh couple of years ago we had uh America uh was a one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned and now we're	3738	A
having a very tough time in a recessionary period we're also have a very humongous trade deficit and uh	3738	A
and that's kind of frightening also you know a couple of years ago ten fifteen- fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life	3738	A
and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every you know every couple years and possibly five- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime	3738	A
and so i think uh	3738	A
you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and a lot- and uh	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
true	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yes yes	3738	A
true true	3738	A
um-hum well do you do you think that's good or bad	3738	A
you think that's great	3738	A
that something- yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn	3738	A
and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and	3738	A
when that's over with that's that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular	3738	A
um education and and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to to expand ourselves also	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yes i agree with that i agree with that so i i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn	3738	A
learn how to adapt learn how to grow in the in their college or whatever education they might take so that that's good that's good	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yeah i i- i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress uh for those people that are laid off and also for those people	3738	A
that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place	3738	A
and it affects-	3738	A
what's the topic	3738	B
okay	3738	B
you bet i'll let you lead out	3738	B
i'll let you lead out	3738	B
i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also	3738	B
so if you look at Russia and what's happened over there i think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing	3738	B
i think was i look at the economic problems in the United States right now one of the things you wonder is what's that going to do to us	3738	B
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i mean i think it's great that you can have three or four different careers in your life i think it must've been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years	3738	B
so i think that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing	3738	B
and the uncertainty of whether you're gonna have a job is not as good but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs	3738	B
i think it's great	3738	B
oh yeah	3738	B
i think one of the problems with with education in as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education- education is prepared to help people make those changes	3738	B
it still seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession	3738	B
and not giving them_1 the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think's gonna be a hard thing for for people to face	3738	B
yeah	3738	B
there probably needs to be some training on how to to to to adjust to these changes as they come about	3738	B
i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them_1 even ideas of how to make those changes now	3738	B
so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them	3738	B
um-hum	3738	B
no i don't no	3785	B
not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
and do you have any children	3785	B
uh-huh	3785	B
yeah	3785	B
yeah yeah	3785	B
i think it's probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than it's realistic that that the school system can provide	3785	B
and in conjunction a lot of um school districts' funds have been cut because of at least in California that's the case it's probably the case elsewhere too	3785	B
i don't even know if it's just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it it's a matter of	3785	B
well it's kind of a philosophical- philosophical expectation about who's responsible for discipline you know it's	3785	B
it	3785	B
you know you- you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and	3785	B
in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for what's important in terms of values and i think that's probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess	3785	B
i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
maybe TV's a bigger um	3785	B
competitor for their time	3785	B
and when we were kids	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
yeah	3785	B
that's a good point just learning the discipline to to to study	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to speak- speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home	3785	B
our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are	3785	B
well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um	3785	B
i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco	3785	B
in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um	3785	B
i have to really do the research to find out	3785	B
whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that	3785	B
it's really the the expense is a real issue when you think about	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
well i don't know how it is in your community i know that um	3785	B
in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually it's not so much in the city actually it's outside more in the east- Oakland or east bay	3785	B
um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that they're getting getting what they want in the public schools so they're almost like public-	3785	B
school teacher or do you have anything to do with anything in schools or	3785	A
no huh	3785	A
no uh not a lot i've got a couple of friends that work uh as teachers or you know in in different school districts and different things but uh	3785	A
i	3785	A
i have a daughter that's only eighteen months though so we haven't got exposed too much to that but	3785	A
you can sure see where it seems like uh	3785	A
there's a lot of concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education i- i kind of wonder i don't know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or exactly what	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
for them to get	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
sure	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
well they've been cut yeah i just it seems like more and more with uh more families having to resort to you know to two incomes and stuff there's not the time that they spend and so they like you say they expect the the schools to do more of it but hell there's only so many in hours a day	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
oh you know i think that's a good point it's really a good point	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
yeah i uh you know it seems like i remember on school nights you know i was never outside past eight you know maybe nine o'clock at the very latest	3785	A
whether i was in doing homework or not you know i may not have been but yet there was that influence in the home to where i was at least you know getting prepared for the next day or whatever and and you're you know you're right in saying you don't see a lot of that there's out running around and uh doing a lot of different things that	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
TV and Nintendo	3785	A
yeah that's probably true there's a lot more uh	3785	A
yeah that's true i know you know i didn't appreciate i	3785	A
i was you know fortunate to where i could i kind of breezed through high school without too much problem stuff and and didn't really learn how to study that much until i hit college	3785	A
but boy i sure wish now that i had picked that up earlier because_1 you know took me a couple of years in college before i really started getting the grades going and	3785	A
you know it affects your whole life especially when you hit college if you don't you know do as well as you can it can it can follow you for quite a while so	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
to sit and study and i don't know it's it's you know i only have the the one daughter and she's quite young but it makes you a little nervous to	3785	A
know what they have to deal with you know in the future and get prepared for them_1 but	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
do you have any children at all or	3785	A
oh yeah	3785	A
same boat	3785	A
yeah have you uh have you ever considered private schools at all or	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
yeah that's true that's true yeah i- i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh	3785	A
sometimes i wonder if they can get that same thing in a in a private high- school or	3785	A
or not	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
do you have gang problems	3772	B
well i'm a school principal	3772	B
um-hum elementary school	3772	B
well its elementary school	3772	B
elementary but i have gang problems	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
i'm in a part of Dallas where there's a lot of gang activity and my i have through the sixth grade	3772	B
but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old	3772	B
and they get recruited	3772	B
so uh	3772	B
we we have really very significant problems	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
yeah	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
its its surprising to me that it's that true there because the only time i've ever been to Utah	3772	B
i spent a week on the Brigham Young campus at a workshop	3772	B
and it was very uh	3772	B
dramatically different that the people you saw than what we see here because you had no minorities you know and	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
but of course you you have a lot of parents that are not really parenting much	3772	B
you have that in Utah	3772	B
you have that in Utah	3772	B
because i would think that big Mormon influence there would uh	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
well i- i work in an an area of town like my school	3772	B
is about seventy five percent Anglo and that's very unusual in the in the Dallas Public Schools	3772	B
but it's very it's like the lowest socioeconomic Anglos	3772	B
yeah it's it's what in the South we call poor white trash	3772	B
and then the other uh significant percentage i have is Hispanic	3772	B
and course that's growing	3772	B
but the kids that i have	3772	B
the biggest discipline problems with are Anglo children	3772	B
and i i've got lots of Anglo children who are just	3772	B
not really wanted by anybody	3772	B
well and for example i have a boy now he checked out today	3772	B
he's fourteen he's in the sixth grade he lived with his mother in Mississippi he had been to he thought ten or twelve schools in Mississippi	3772	B
then his mother now his mother and father aren't divorced but they don't live together in a long time his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child support for his children	3772	B
that they couldn't afford to keep her children anymore so they sent them_1 here	3772	B
and here he was with his father and his father's pregnant girlfriend	3772	B
and they pawned all his personal belongings like he had a Nintendo and a VCR and some stuff they pawned that	3772	B
and he's just been tearing my school up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to Mississippi	3772	B
and today they checked him out to send him back to Mississippi	3772	B
now those kids	3772	B
yeah but	3772	B
yeah but those kids are	3772	B
ready fodder for gangs	3772	B
sure they belong gives them_1 something to belong to gives them_1 identity gives them_1 importance	3772	B
gives them_1 a certain security	3772	B
and um	3772	B
so i guess most of what happens happens in Salt Lake which is just about twenty miles south of us and that's quite a bit bigger and	3772	A
they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like LA a little bit but	3772	A
yeah it's there they- they say its getting a lot bigger uh	3772	A
oh are you so you're right familiar with all that i bet	3772	A
oh it's a what	3772	A
oh yeah	3772	A
oh at- that young huh you're kidding at which-	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah so they're getting started	3772	A
oh you're kidding	3772	A
i'll bet	3772	A
my wife was just uh talking to her mother and uh i guess they said they had an F B I come- guy come to there she she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know gang and stuff like that and	3772	A
and uh that you know it some day it'll eventually past but right now they say there's all kinds of kids getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street and that's get it's getting pretty darn scary i've got a little eighteen	3772	A
it	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
yeah that's true	3772	A
yeah i think we've probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldn't say we're anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but	3772	A
it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the the gang related things they put them_1 in jail and then they they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around L A or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but	3772	A
you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at ten eleven o'clock just roaming the streets and	3772	A
i just never remember that when you know it's been a while since i was in junior high or high school- or even elementary school but	3772	A
you just- i just you were never out past eight or nine o'clock on a school night you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and	3772	A
yeah that's true and you know and i think when it come	3772	A
pardon	3772	A
yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i	3772	A
yeah with with that with that Mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the two parent income or the two income families and and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the the values taught in the home that you used to get	3772	A
and and the kids are left to to to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i I really think that's what you're missing- we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught years ago to	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yo yeah	3772	A
i would think so yeah	3772	A
oh really	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
oh really	3772	A
huh not by their families or anything	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
sheesh	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
oh jeez	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
jeez	3772	A
huh	3772	A
you're kidding you know and that and it's so sad because_1 you i mean sure it's the kids doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah	3772	A
oh yeah	3772	A
the people show them_1 some interest show them_1 some love and	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
okay now what is your favorite TV show	3766	A
well can't you find anything else to um to replace	3766	A
so you don't watch Northern Exposure	3766	A
oh okay you're having to be in reruns for that one have you seen Brooklyn Bridge	3766	A
that is one of it's so clean and so laid back and i'm awful tired of	3766	A
some of the things that they have on TV but this thirty minute story is i would certainly recommend that you try it	3766	A
it-	3766	A
oh okay	3766	A
well	3766	A
and i think it's a shame that our life has to be i mean so many of the tragedies that we have on the movies or on TV no we need something lighter than that have you seen um	3766	A
hm i'll Fly Away	3766	A
yes yeah	3766	A
well	3766	A
um it's not	3766	A
i don't know it it's clean it there again you don't have the violence	3766	A
and um i'm surprised it's even still on because coming at seven o'clock in the evening that's when the children want to watch	3766	A
and that is not part of it	3766	A
so um	3766	A
oh	3766	A
well i'm let's see i believe Texas lost last night is that correct	3766	A
well you don't have to	3766	A
well don't you ever forget that Oklahoma is not bad but Oklahoma	3766	A
Oklahoma State though is the better of the two so	3766	A
that's right um-hum i'm a transplanted Texan- Okie um-hum	3766	A
well we've from somewhere is correct so i hope you can find enough TV to keep you happy this winter	3766	A
well i have recently retired and i find that this is the most boring thing in the world is to sit and watch TV	3766	A
oh you don't well	3766	A
well	3766	A
it's	3766	A
oh it's nice to have the noise sometime it's nice that you don't need that noise	3766	A
do you work out of the home	3766	A
oh	3766	A
okay	3766	A
i was an accountant at the medical school here for the food service	3766	A
and it was a very heavy desk and a very busy desk and i'm awful sorry that i'm no longer gainfully employed but they're	3766	A
well it was Newhart and it's gone now and i miss it real bad	3766	B
uh yeah i think so i like the new Home Improvement sitcom i like any- i like most of the sitcoms if they keep me entertained for a half an hour	3766	B
i do watch Northern Exposure and also for for ever how many years it's been on TV i've been watching Knots Landing	3766	B
no i haven't seen that one yet	3766	B
uh	3766	B
i don't know my wife- i don't know but you know my wife watches all those Rescue 911 Unsolved Mystery things	3766	B
drives me nuts	3766	B
i just don't even like to be in the room when all of those are on it's like too much real life	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
i'll Fly Away i think i watched that that's where there there's a lawyer and he has a black nurse or a nanny	3766	B
i watched that once when it- i think when it the first episode and it just didn't grab my attention	3766	B
i felt like it was kind of they were trying to copy To Kill a Mockingbird without all the suspense or something	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
right	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
actually it's	3766	B
the best time of the year for me for watching TV is is starts around Christmas and will end in April and that's for the college basketball	3766	B
um really get involved in that my wife played basketball when she was in high school and college so that's something we can both watch and keep up with which is pretty interesting at time	3766	B
you know i'm not sure if Texas won or lost i can't i don't even keep up with them or either my uh son goes there i just don't keep up with them_1	3766	B
no my favorite teams are back east and they seem to be the best ones anyway so	3766	B
it's	3766	B
yeah well Oklahoma's doing good this year it	3766	B
yeah that where you are from Oklahoma yeah	3766	B
well aren't we all are from somewhere	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
well there's always actually i'll probably watch too much TV and and	3766	B
uh i think that probably effects me too from- just from watching too much	3766	B
so yeah well i'm at home all the time myself and uh i don't work	3766	B
and i never ever turn the TV on during the day	3766	B
uh just just something i i can't do i won't do and when someone else is here during the day and and like my son's been out of school for a month drives me nuts when he turns that thing on during the day	3766	B
well	3766	B
uh no- i have a medical problem and i don't haven't worked for three years so	3766	B
so that that just i just stay home and	3766	B
run errands do chores keep you know do the house work for my wife she still works and uh that sort of thing	3766	B
what kind of a job did you have when you were working	3766	B
yeah well	3766	B
Kathy you you know i'm i was thinking about basketball teams and um the funny thing is when i was in college at BYU i followed the school team and um	3718	A
and then when i graduated and we got married and everything i really kind of lost interest in following teams have you been following any	3718	A
oh no i know they're always having um i mean i can't believe the amount of money that the players make in the first place and i mean i know that they have a short um career and everything	3718	A
that's true it's really a lot but uh my sister always gets um season tickets to the Utah Jazz and um	3718	A
so she watches their games a lot and and everything but i don't believe we've ever been involved with any team that you know makes it to the play-offs	3718	A
too much	3718	A
uh-huh	3718	A
you did	3718	A
well i was at uh BYU when they made it to the play-offs and i think they played Notre Dame or something	3718	A
um for the big game i can't remember now that was so seems like it was eons ago it was like ten years ago i think and um i remember-	3718	A
um isn't that the one that was like the star player was Danny Ainge i think he started playing for the Boston- Boston Celtics after that	3718	A
and um and um and there was another the center	3718	A
it's been so long i can't think of anyone's name but um i i was there that year and enjoyed that game and uh but mostly like i say i haven't been following the teams and don't know who's got what record	3718	A
i haven't played uh since i broke my knee cap but um i did play in high school i was on our high school girls' team	3718	A
well i lived in Missouri and i went and i played for Parkview High School in Missouri- in Springfield Missouri and i played um a forward	3718	A
and um i enjoyed that then and that's i always loved sports do you play for your ward	3718	A
the problem that is a problem	3718	A
uh-huh	3718	A
no well i was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as opposed to professional because_1 i'd rather play than watch any thing	3718	A
and um so i'm you know like i	3718	A
well i um i have one i don't like his name- his last name was Sampson do you -remember him and he because_1 he came to Houston when i lived there and um to play for the Houston team and he was really	3718	A
i thought a bad sport and uh and i haven't followed like i say	3718	A
um-hum um-hum	3718	A
yeah that's really true but um	3718	A
well and i also don't want to spend so much of my time um memorizing statistics	3718	A
um-hum	3718	A
that's true and and you know i get i have interest in the games but i'm satisfied to watch a score in the newspaper or on you know the sports news report or something	3718	A
right rather than just like you say watch clips from the game	3718	A
no i my both my children are little they're just in kindergarten and first grade	3718	A
so no they don't play and um	3718	A
and my husband loves baseball which i don't really prefer but	3718	A
so we haven't uh haven't don't been into basketball too much but anyway	3718	A
now i can remember even what they were called um	3718	A
no i don't think so no it was the Astros the Astros were the baseball team and the Oilers Rockets yes that's it the Rockets	3718	A
yeah i uh you know we saw a game	3718	A
hi	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
not too much um who is it from the Mavericks that just wasn't there some controversy about one of their players that didn't get to play so now he doesn't he didn't get to play the whole game so now he doesn't want to play at all or something	3718	B
its crazy	3718	B
right but even so i mean i don't think i will make a million in or three million in a life time let alone a season	3718	B
yep	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah yeah we came from Oakland i went to BYU also	3718	B
yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really haven't done much with the Mavericks here	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
did you know let me think who was on that team there was a Dave Callus or a Gordon Breun remember those names	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
Celtics right right	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
right so do you play for your ward team	3718	B
oh oh	3718	B
uh-huh where did you go to high school	3718	B
oh	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
um i kind of stopped playing for my ward because_1 i didn't like the sportsmanship with the stake	3718	B
so i play for a Richardson City league now	3718	B
but as far as knowing anything about professional teams you know when they said to put	3718	B
right right	3718	B
right	3718	B
do you have any players that you like watching	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
it really only takes one player to really give any team a bad rap you know one that	3718	B
publicity bound you know that	3718	B
right	3718	B
yeah that's right	3718	B
you know once it gets into the finals then i i kind of root for one or the other but up until then you know	3718	B
yeah the highlights	3718	B
do you have kids that play	3718	B
yeah yeah	3718	B
oh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
oh did you stay with now what team is it from Houston	3718	B
i wanna say Spurs but is that right	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
Rockets	3718	B
yeah	3718	B

um-hum um-hum well my i have also have a four bedroom house	3775	A
uh we have three bathrooms two upstairs and one downstairs	3775	A
which makes it nice because um it's right off the garage so when Gene's working on his cars he can come in and take a shower without going through the rest of the house	3775	A
and then um	3775	A
i have a it's in a small city of like um eight thousand people	3775	A
and i don't know if you've heard of Modesto that's the closest big city	3775	A
yeah yeah and it's on a cul-de-sac um	3775	A
which makes it nice because there's no through traffic you know about all the cars that come in here are people that just live right in here	3775	A
and uh	3775	A
yeah it makes a lot nicer space i say- i imagine you have little kids right	3775	A
oh okay well i have one also but he's he'll be thirty seven in uh February	3775	A
so but anyhow i have lots of little neighbor kids and they all love me and i just just worship them they can come in my house i have candy for them_1 and cookies for them_1	3775	A
you know so i'm just like their aunt Rosy	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
oh yeah it's	3775	A
but anyhow as far as decorating my house and everything too i've uh stenciled uh practically	3775	A
in every room in my house	3775	A
which um it looked like it would be very hard to do but it ended up being really easy and it just really just makes the rooms	3775	A
you know i stenciled right above the right below the ceiling line on the walls like- it looks something like a wallpaper border but it's actually is a stencil	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
uh-huh um-hum	3775	A
um-hum um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
well you can't afford to have it done you know plus it's fun i enjoy you know going out and working in the yard and	3775	A
you know just doing everything decorating the house up and changing it in fact i just bought a	3775	A
a large bird cage i had seen in magazines how they were decorating them that not that i want a bird i don't want a bird	3775	A
but i have decorated it up with flowers	3775	A
and i got a little nest in there that looks like it's got two little birds in there and i've got some dolls sitting in there	3775	A
it looks really really cute	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum um-hum	3775	A
yeah it's kind of fun to change too isn't it	3775	A
fudgesicle color no	3775	A
yeah it probably goes with a lot of different colors too	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
well you are the first man that i've talked to	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
yes	3775	B
okay_1	3775	B
well it's four bedroom two bath a brick ranch house uh on a kind of a quiet dead end street next to a big wide open field	3775	B
but we're two blocks from everything you need including a small mall	3775	B
and lots of businesses within walking distance but uh	3775	B
Austin's about a million people	3775	B
so it's it's it's it's it's a nice town it's real kind of a laid back place and uh kind of an environmentally conscious city	3775	B
i've heard of it i've never been there	3775	B
yeah i like that feature about where we live that was one of the reasons we bought this house is because_1 there's only six street six houses on the on the street so	3775	B
no no not at all i have uh one kid and he's twenty- almost twenty one	3775	B
uh we still have	3775	B
there are actually no kids right in the immediate neighborhood but uh we just moved here about two years ago and we still have kids from the old neighborhood which is only a few blocks they come to visit they expect brownies	3775	B
yeah they'll they'll stay till you bake a bunch but uh	3775	B
yeah	3775	B
right	3775	B
my wife and i've never tried any stenciling uh we've always thought we she wanted to anyway	3775	B
uh somehow i feel like this particular house doesn't call for stenciling we've done some wallpapering and	3775	B
uh my wife really likes to paint different colors and things so	3775	B
do all of our own uh decorating work and repair work around the house and yard work	3775	B
sometimes it's	3775	B
oh yeah	3775	B
yeah my wife just remodeled since Christmas she's remodeled our bedroom	3775	B
with all new sheets comforters things like that and paint and she did a wallpaper border	3775	B
new drapes uh looks it's just a whole different- different atmosphere in there looks kind of like i like to hang out in there now during the daytime	3775	B
it's just	3775	B
yeah she picked a for the walls she picked a fudgesicle color	3775	B
yeah	3775	B
which well i thought well i don't know if this'll work but when she finished	3775	B
it really looked good	3775	B
yeah i don't think she meant for it to go with anything other than just fudgesicle walls and the ends the white trim	3775	B
um just to give it a little bit different look than what it's always been or been lately anyway so	3775	B
really yeah	3775	B
um i would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this category	3740	A
oh you'll talk about anything right	3740	A
uh me too what kind of books do you read	3740	A
i see	3740	A
we're gonna get along well well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as Stephen King and such	3740	A
well thank goodness believe me	3740	A
have you read The Firm	3740	A
oh that was one of the best books i've read for a long time	3740	A
and um see another one i just read that i thought was really excellent was uh Jurassic Park	3740	A
Michael Crichton or something like that have you read that one	3740	A
no it's about um this multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start a theme park and it's about dinosaurs	3740	A
well they've taken DNA material from dinosaurs and and	3740	A
really recreated dinosaurs	3740	A
and well it's a little far fetched also but um it was really an excellent book it held my interest have you read any of his other things	3740	A
Terminal Man yeah i've seen seems like i've seen the movie	3740	A
i've read a couple of Robin Cook's	3740	A
um-hum	3740	A
well i noticed he had a couple i don't know how recent they are but i think Sphere was one and something else uh another one word title and i thought i might pick up one of those books because	3740	A
Sphere S P H E R E	3740	A
well how about did you read Silence of the Lambs	3740	A
yes i did	3740	A
they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was i- i could not put the book down i	3740	A
you're kidding	3740	A
oh yes	3740	A
i see	3740	A
the movie was wonderful you didn't see it	3740	A
well true it didn't have the impact but i thought that they stayed- uh they stayed very faithful to the book	3740	A
well	3740	A
it's hard to top that book	3740	A
oh really what's it about have you another serial killer	3740	A
oh	3740	A
Two Minute Warning	3740	A
you know i think you're right i think i	3740	A
i'll have to look back and see what else he's written because he	3740	A
really	3740	A
okay	3740	B
but i- i also picked gardening and i mean i tried to talk about that for five minutes i don't really garden very much but books i could talk about you know forever i	3740	B
well mostly fiction and um i- i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories	3740	B
see and um	3740	B
oh you too	3740	B
i	3740	B
yeah well i like uh i- i like a book i could	3740	B
in some way relate to and and that's i don't know it's so off the wall most of that stuff you know you really- i you can't really believe it- i mean you it's hard to to to read it and and really think that this could really happen it's it's i don't know it's not	3740	B
believable to me at all	3740	B
well well that's true i mean you don't have to read a book and believe that you know stuff can happen but i don't know i guess i just go more for realism	3740	B
oh yeah it's very good	3740	B
yeah	3740	B
yeah that was good i read that oh quite a while ago	3740	B
oh by um oh Crichton right Crichton now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing	3740	B
oh	3740	B
uh-huh	3740	B
yeah yeah	3740	B
yes i have but i Terminal Man was that- was that one of his	3740	B
he- he writes stuff his writing- books are similar to Robin Cook's have you read any Robin Cook	3740	B
yeah and they're sort of similar you know the in the you know he deals a lot in you know scientific stuff or you know stuff that um	3740	B
you don't know whether could it could happen or not you know it's just um	3740	B
you know but i mean most of it is good i uh haven't uh i haven't read anything by him in a long time	3740	B
Fear is that what you said Fear	3740	B
oh oh no i don't know i'm not familiar with that no	3740	B
oh oh yes oh yes- you- did you read his other one The Red Dragon yes now uh both of them were terrific	3740	B
well see now i couldn't either now i uh a friend of mine started to read it because_1 you know i told her it's terrific and everybody she'd spoke to said it was terrific she couldn't get into it	3740	B
well she's sort of a lightweight anyway you know her her uh her reading consists of uh have you ever heard of V C Andrews	3740	B
yeah you know stuff like that you know Danielle Steele you know you know stuff like that so she really she couldn't get into this but she i think she said she saw the movie she liked the movie i don't you know	3740	B
yeah the movie was good but i well you know compared to the book right no	3740	B
well they did but um i don't think it was as scary as i expected it to be i- i really you know	3740	B
i- i don't know i just didn't think it was as suspenseful as as	3740	B
i expected it to be i don't know but it was a good it was a good movie	3740	B
yeah well that's true and i'm waiting his new one comes out sometime in the spring i think	3740	B
yes	3740	B
uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well this- this'll be i think his fourth or fifth book	3740	B
and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black Sunday which was a about the uh bombing in the in the Superdome oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that	3740	B
um gee i don't know i think it was called Black Sunday it was about fifteen- well no about ten years ago i guess it uh you know	3740	B
but um	3740	B
that's all he's written Red Dragon that one and uh Silence of the	3740	B
um well i'm glad i got a male because i'm gonna need some help um i haven't really given any dinner parties but um	3715	A
so um maybe you could help me out here in this sense and i keep i keep asking him you know what what what do you think we ought to have you know but i was thinking of like you one of those subway sandwiches those long subway sandwiches and maybe uh	3715	A
um a pasta salad and some chips and some beer and some Coke and um i thought a cake and he said no and so we're just going back and forth so	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
yeah yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah he's i don't really think men care do they	3715	A
yeah that's what he said	3715	A
right	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah yeah so that oh okay i'll guess i'll do something like that but um	3715	A
oh really	3715	A
okay what is that	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
oh really is this an artichoke dip because_1 a friend of mine had that at at one of her parties and it was really good but when she told me it was artichoke dip i was going oh no	3715	A
as i'm not much of a fan for artichoke-	3715	A
that one see i thought that was something else	3715	A
huh	3715	A
huh	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah that's a party- it sounds like the same thing my friend served and it was really good but when she told me it had artichokes in i thought oh God	3715	A
yeah uh-huh it was	3715	A
well my husband loved it yeah he really did	3715	A
oh really huh	3715	A
yeah okay yeah and he wanted uh uh some uh chili dip that i usually make too so	3715	A
oh yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
and no women and children allowed and i	3715	A
yeah i guess so well um let me see we went to a Christmas party and uh a friend of mine had this and it was she had the she was the one that had that dip	3715	A
and another thing that my husband really liked that i and i liked too that i would have never thought of serving and it was really easy	3715	A
um and it sounds- it doesn't sound good but when you all put when you put it together and you taste it it's real- excellent it's um the Mexicorn and	3715	A
and corn chips you mix all that together with a bottle of the Catalina dressing and you and you just mix it all together and you serve it like that and it is really good	3715	A
well i	3715	B
you you could probably probably get uh the sub might work	3715	B
uh the beer will definitely work a lot of that	3715	B
and uh chips and dips will probably work	3715	B
uh not really to be honest with you i mean i i've never i've never really cared i just like little munchies and stuff basically you know just dip chips and dip usually do it if there's enough of it	3715	B
but	3715	B
males usually aren't into meals you know like more than- and not as much as women you know like just sitting around and eat the finger sandwiches and stuff	3715	B
and but uh i've always- i've always you know just had chips dip and beer and just gone for it from there	3715	B
i got a i got a good dip	3715	B
yeah i- i stole it from a restaurant	3715	B
it is uh you get a can of can of uh chopped spinach	3715	B
and you get uh fresh Parmesan Cheese	3715	B
and you get uh uh artichoke hearts	3715	B
okay you get uh a whole can of artichoke hearts	3715	B
you take about out of the i tell you out of the it's about a four ounce can of spinach out of that you take about an ounce and a half to two ounces of spinach	3715	B
okay you stick all of it in a food processor	3715	B
okay you need to get uh	3715	B
and you grind- mix it up real good it's almost pureed	3715	B
to a degree and you heat that up	3715	B
and you take uh i'd say approximately eight ounces of the fresh Parmesan Cheese and you uh put it in there while it's heating up	3715	B
and you mix it up	3715	B
and this is a recipe from Houston's restaurant	3715	B
that i stole yeah	3715	B
yeah	3715	B
yeah this is artichokes spinach and parmesan cheese and that's all that's in there	3715	B
oh i'm sorry and heavy it has heavy cream in it too	3715	B
i forgot forgot about that	3715	B
it has heavy cream in there i- i- i just i fling it every time i do it i	3715	B
mean i don't have anything written down i just kind of know it from i just go by taste and texture	3715	B
i've never really written it down but they never give me any specs on it i've just kind of	3715	B
had a variance of it you know every time i go in and it gets pretty close you've just got to watch how much spinach you put in there you've got to put it a little bit at a time it should be a uh	3715	B
uh uh like- about a guacamole- lighter than a guacamole color	3715	B
yeah and it's served	3715	B
yeah and it's served hot	3715	B
it's served hot	3715	B
it yeah and it's real good i don't know if they'd go for that or not but it's just a real good dip	3715	B
yeah it's a fancy- i think in Houston's it's called a Chicago dip	3715	B
yeah	3715	B
if you ever go there try it that's the stuff	3715	B
chili is usually guys usually go for chili now that you now that you mention it	3715	B
probably go for chili and beer that's always a good gas burner	3715	B
that's right	3715	B
plenty- plenty of ceiling fans going	3715	B
uh-huh	3715	B
right	3715	B
huh	3715	B
so national health care i don't know about you but for me i am voting for the next democrat for the president uh that says he's going to do something about a national health care program	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
yeah i myself uh	3748	A
i haven't worked for three years because of some medical problems and uh if i had not had insurance	3748	A
with the company i worked with at the time i believe i would have died and that worries me thinking cause i know a lot of people that don't have any coverage at all	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
well i i think that paying for it on your own it is like in my case i am up to about two hundred thousand dollars worth of health care i don't think that would have been possible for the majority of the people in this world	3748	A
so but then again there is uh the high cost of medical care is out unreal	3748	A
uh-huh	3748	A
well i think somewhere along the line whatever plan they come up with it is going to have to keep the doctors in a high paying field	3748	A
uh i myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more years and uh he is doing it for the money	3748	A
so	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked out for the people that can't afford it	3748	A
right	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
i found out yeah i uh my mother is on Medicare Medicaid whatever and uh i know it doesn't pay all of her medical- hospital bills and so forth	3748	A
and i think it is kind of a shame that at this point in her life she still has to pay quite a bit whenever she is in the hospital several thousand for you know for a weeks stay if she ends up having to pay	3748	A
uh-huh	3748	A
i know one uh not this Christmas but the Christmas before she was out here and we were out at Smithville which is a little town out east of here and	3748	A
we had to take her to the hospital on a Sunday afternoon for a back problem uh fairly minor she just strained it sprained it but	3748	A
when the bills starting coming in she had already gone home so i got a chance to look at them and i was shocked i mean i had been through a lot	3748	A
i mean with medical bills but when i saw what they did to her that day and it cost about three thousand dollars just to uh get a prescription for some pain pills basically	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
well that doesn't happen i	3748	A
it is weird i was in the hospital for like eight days back in October uh so many mistakes were made during my time there that i uh literally left the hospital in a taxi cab	3748	A
just to get away from the place i was scared as to what they were going to do to me next	3748	A
and when i got the bill it was outrageous uh pills that i had never heard of that i had taken which i know that i didn't i mean i wasn't ill i was just in for some routine stuff and it goes on and on	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
right	3748	A
i think Kerrey is and i think also Jerry Brown from California are interested uh actually the way Bush has been going the last few weeks i think he may be interested uh he he seem to be	3748	A
yeah uh	3748	A
yeah up until just recently i i would have thought Bush would uh you know i still he has done a pretty good job	3748	A
yeah i uh i basically agree uh i have	3748	B
mixed feelings i guess there are some uh	3748	B
somehow there needs to be some controls on the rising costs of of health care	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah if you if you don't have a very good paying job or you are not with a company that provides it it is uh pretty much unaffordable uh to pay for it on your own	3748	B
yeah that is right	3748	B
yeah i have a friend who uh uh is from uh lived at lived in London or lived in London and he lives here now where they do have medical- uh health care uh there and i guess	3748	B
i guess there is some disadvantages too i guess uh uh because of that they there has been a great uh	3748	B
migration of of doctors from there over to more lucrative practices and sometimes i guess it does effect the quality of health care somewhat so	3748	B
i-	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah yeah they don't have i think they don't get into it for any other reason	3748	B
um	3748	B
yes uh i uh agree too and also the uh the elderly a lot of times when they uh reach retirement uh	3748	B
they can't afford any any supplemental insurance beyond what is provided through Medicare and Medicaid and sometimes that is not enough to to cover the costs	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah particularly for people who are on uh on on just living mostly on social security or something like that they don't have enough extra money to pay for that	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah yeah	3748	B
uh in i guess in addition to uh uh national health care policy there uh there has to be some sort of	3748	B
monitoring i guess too of the overall medical field and hospital costs and and	3748	B
uh	3748	B
yeah yeah	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah i am afraid right now there is a lot of i guess you would have to call it just basic fraud in the in in the business cause they know they can turn a lot of these things in and they are not uh questioned at all	3748	B
uh i don't know which one of the uh democratic candidates either either Kerrey or Clinton i guess one of those two i can't remember which is pretty much in favor of some sort of	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
well he's he's probably campaigning i don't know how serious he is but	3748	B
well Nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um yeah i agree i also think that there are more um the people are women stay single longer it seems like	3743	A
yeah i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty two so	3743	A
you know um i know that	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
yeah yeah seems like there uh-huh go ahead	3743	A
oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too i mean that's there're a lot of	3743	A
either divorced or um	3743	A
you know never been married so	3743	A
yeah i agree	3743	A
well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah and it really it's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um	3743	A
i mean i i don't blame anybody when they have to work because_1 um yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah well what do you think's gonna happen in the next generation you think it'll continue yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah it is i think some	3743	A
i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children i guess i see that happening already	3743	A
some choosing it and and they get you know there're people chide them_1 for it you know why aren't you out	3743	A
well of course working	3743	B
including me well what do you think it is	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yes they do yeah they do	3743	B
right	3743	B
uh-huh yeah	3743	B
yeah that's true it's a big change i'm an OB nurse and so i really do see what you're saying there	3743	B
it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients' ages	3743	B
and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young so yeah you're right there's a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties	3743	B
so that's true but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers	3743	B
if they didn't have if they weren't out there working and having their careers	3743	B
they probably would be married and having their children so i guess it's a combination	3743	B
no go on	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of mixed up families that's for sure yeah	3743	B
well just that i think the families	3743	B
the the role in the family and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children	3743	B
um we do it all i really think that and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers	3743	B
have the major role i really do i think they're just	3743	B
they're not doing very much less i don't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides	3743	B
i think that we're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves	3743	B
oh it is	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yeah it's it's difficult and i think that i live in Plano actually so	3743	B
it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better	3743	B
and i really hate that you know i hate to see that and- and i've been here for a very long time	3743	B
but um	3743	B
i don't know now i'm a single parent and i don't have a choice anymore but	3743	B
i used to just work occasionally for extra money but now i have to work all the time and that's really hard and and i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and	3743	B
and leave the kids in a way it's good it's very good to get out with adults and i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and	3743	B
and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's	3743	B
not very smart i think that's difficult on them_1 so	3743	B
well it's gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but i'm not sure how it's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford	3743	B
to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it	3743	B
and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards	3743	B
but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it	3743	B
and they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families it's hard to say	3743	B
uh-huh	3743	B
uh so what do you like best about golf	3779	A
really	3779	A
really	3779	A
yeah i play uh i play probably four or five times a week my my wife and kids	3779	A
don't like it too much but	3779	A
it's such a great game i- i- i play three- you know thirty six holes after work	3779	A
and then uh	3779	A
yeah it does in the summertime in the winter it's too you know but uh you know i go to the indoor driving range all all winter and uh	3779	A
and uh i practice putting and it's it's a fun game	3779	A
oh really	3779	A
that sounds great	3779	A
well i have to do that because i love golf and	3779	A
well	3779	A
Cathy is that your name Cathy um	3779	A
do you-	3779	A
do you uh	3779	A
do you have a favorite golfer	3779	A
professional golfer excuse me my wife is making fun of me	3779	A
yeah she hates it when i you know she thinks it's funny that i got golf as a topic because_1 you know she dislikes it so much so	3779	A
yeah	3779	A
Greg Norman why	3779	A
are you sure you're not attracted to him or anything	3779	A
uh-huh	3779	A
yeah yeah i like Tom he's good	3779	A
yeah i'll agree with you there Cathy	3779	A
yeah he does	3779	A
uh i'd have to say uh	3779	A
i- i still like the Golden Bear you know	3779	A
oh yeah i- i like the senior tour i- i think it's got more personality	3779	A
you know and the names don't change every week you know	3779	A
so	3779	A
sure	3779	A
sure	3779	A
really	3779	A
my kids	3779	A
do you have kids Cathy	3779	A
i'm starting them off young i'm gonna get them oh you got a boy good	3779	A
he does has he got a pretty good stance	3779	A
huh	3779	A
oh	3779	A
huh	3779	A
well that's true	3779	A
that's true he's out getting some sunshine anyway	3779	A
i like to watch golf my husband plays golf and i've i've really become	3779	B
fairly acquainted with the game it's pretty interesting to watch i think my favorite part of the game is the putting part	3779	B
uh-huh do you play	3779	B
oh my	3779	B
well i've already	3779	B
good heavens	3779	B
it must stay light out there pretty well	3779	B
in the summer- well yeah in the summer uh-huh	3779	B
um-hum	3779	B
there's a place here in Dallas it's called Dave and Buster's	3779	B
and they have a laser well it's like lasers golf game	3779	B
where there's three beams and you take your clubs and you hit the ball and they give you a screen of what you would be seeing from where you lie	3779	B
it's really a lot of fun and it's it's fairly comparable to some of the nicer golf courses around here the nicer public courses the price of it is	3779	B
if you're ever in Dallas you'd have to go to Dave and Buster's	3779	B
it is a very fine game i think it teaches a lot of goodness- a lot of good um	3779	B
attributes	3779	B
to people	3779	B
yeah you got it right	3779	B
do i have a favorite golfer	3779	B
oh talking about golf on the T I thing	3779	B
uh when you start up on golf	3779	B
well you probably picked it though on your list of of topics to speak about	3779	B
um i would say that my favorite golfer is Greg Norman	3779	B
there's just something about the way he plays golf he just approaches the ball	3779	B
so confidently	3779	B
and the way he hits he's just really he's got kind of a funny swing but beyond that he's really he seems a very confident player and he does	3779	B
he does play fairly well	3779	B
what about yourself-	3779	B
well that may be too he's he's not the most attractive guy on the on the tour i'll say that but uh	3779	B
i guess after watching	3779	B
for so long for so long i've been i've been watching and hearing about golf from my husband for	3779	B
six years six and a half years or a little more	3779	B
and after a while you get to where yeah you start watching who plays well and who doesn't i think Tom Kite is another good player	3779	B
he's got a real ugly stance but	3779	B
he does he he does play real well and he he seems to almost always win	3779	B
so he's so that's got to say a lot for him right there that he just wins quite often	3779	B
what about yourself who is your favorite player	3779	B
even on the even on the senior tour	3779	B
well yeah well the guys have	3779	B
the there's one thing that's true yeah you can always count on Lee and Chichi and Don January and	3779	B
and uh oh yeah the Golden Bear out there hitting them_1 up	3779	B
putting them_1 in	3779	B
uh-huh yeah i have a young boy	3779	B
uh-huh oh he already plays golf he's not eighteen months and he golfs around the house	3779	B
uh-huh	3779	B
no he's horrible but but he loves	3779	B
to he's got a a set of three little plastic clubs and little plastic balls and he takes his club and he whacks the ball around the house and he whacks the cat and then he'll get a big play ball and bounce it around with his club	3779	B
but he really enjoys taking them out and he likes to watch his daddy practice swing and putt around the house so	3779	B
yeah i'm i'm already a golf widow and i don't mind it i mean i know where my husband is when he's out	3779	B
and he's in a very wholesome environment while he's out there so	3779	B
yeah	3779	B
it's	3779	B
yeah i've been with i was with uh TI for uh thirty four years so obviously i found something worth worth doing there and have prejudices about uh what i want	3786	B
yeah uh where do you work	3786	B
oh	3786	B
yeah they uh	3786	B
i'm not sure what the category's supposed to be uh but it was what	3786	B
something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company	3786	B
uh	3786	B
other other than salary didn't it say yeah	3786	B
well i'm i thought it said other than salary but yeah	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with Chance-Vought before i joined uh	3786	B
there and ironically i left Chance-Vought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some	3786	B
thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company	3786	B
and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh	3786	B
then it became Dallas County's largest employer oh	3786	B
but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh	3786	B
wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh	3786	B
heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time	3786	B
and it's amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them	3786	B
uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing	3786	B
and power and they they just couldn't understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others	3786	B
uh including IBM's that in the technical community salary was never first it was usually about third and yeah	3786	B
right	3786	B
right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort	3786	B
uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes was the salary	3786	B
and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the	3786	B
oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you know because- because_1 they just couldn't believe that that people weren't motivated by money	3786	B
yeah well i'm sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but	3786	B
in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could get- you could get a job elsewhere anytime- any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh	3786	B
in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing	3786	B
-hello okay so you were with TI huh	3786	A
well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right	3786	A
i uh work for myself i sell uh metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh uh	3786	A
oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i can't really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time	3786	A
and uh i think most people don't necessarily realize the cost of them_1 and they're somewhat probably getting out of hand	3786	A
well	3786	A
i think uh	3786	A
oh the way i got-	3786	A
right well no it didn't necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess	3786	A
such as	3786	A
well i i imagine that's what they're referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh	3786	A
and they grew up around you didn't it	3786	A
uh-huh	3786	A
yeah	3786	A
um-hum	3786	A
right right	3786	A
well i think as long as it's comparable with you know the job or can	3786	A
that uh you aren't being picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i	3786	A
yes yes	3786	A
well-	3786	A
right	3786	A
well i i wouldn't say they aren't motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are	3786	A
equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh	3786	A
yes	3786	A
right	3786	A
right	3786	A
oh okay	3771	B
um well you're in quite a um interesting city for um crime drugs and all kinds of things that we hear about aren't you	3771	B
oh i see uh-huh	3771	B
uh-huh i see	3771	B
um	3771	B
yeah	3771	B
well it's probably- each city i guess has its own specific type of difficulty	3771	B
oh there's a lot of homicides in Dallas that seems to be	3771	B
uh well a lot of it is drug related but i- i think that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms bearing uh you know personal arms bearing	3771	B
uh and it it seems to just lend itself to instantaneous um if you're don't feel good about a certain thing there you go and the crime is committed so uh	3771	B
um	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
oh i see um-hum	3771	B
i'm not sure i know sufficiently about the ins and outs of the law to um	3771	B
know exactly what that brings about you know the the appeals and things like that as far as the people being um retrialed and maybe get an alleviated sentence	3771	B
it does seem though that the jail capacities are stretching to the fullest and uh	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
oh	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum that's right	3771	B
um	3771	B
uh-huh	3771	B
that's right i believe that	3771	B
um-hum um-hum	3771	B
oh my in the parking lot oh yes uh-huh um	3771	B
um	3771	B
it's very difficult to know what the answer is and uh along with that there's a lot of poverty- poverty a lot of homeless and	3771	B
and a lot of um i guess um discrimination is still around and	3771	B
i- i suppose until somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things people are just going to take an extreme uh measure and um uh protect themselves in one way or the other	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
uh-huh	3771	B
oh	3771	B
oh i didn't know that	3771	B
oh that's very strange	3771	B
because uh discuss crime in America and what we might be able- uh do to uh help stop it	3771	A
oh yeah well actually i- i- i live in Houston i'm in Miami on business	3771	A
uh but i've i've been down here quite a bit for the past oh six months on and off	3771	A
and yes there is plenty of crime in Miami uh but you know um i don't know that it's any worse than Houston	3771	A
and i know there's plenty of crime in Dallas too	3771	A
yeah	3771	A
yeah i have uh i was talking with some with- with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the United States but i'm almost of the opinion	3771	A
that the only way that a change is going to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh	3771	A
have a a swift and and sure justice that uh you know do away with some of these automatic uh appeals when uh i think that guilt is proven	3771	A
well in in Houston it's absurd they are letting uh uh people that have been convicted three times for armed robbery	3771	A
for example and this was they had a big article in the Houston newspaper about it	3771	A
because of the overcrowding they're being released from Huntsville they're given two hundred dollars and put on a bus for Houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer	3771	A
less than twenty percent or twenty- ten percent it was a ridiculously low low number actually do ever report to a parole- parole officer	3771	A
and the vast majority of them_1 are then caught again go through the courts back to jail well it's ludicrous and absurd	3771	A
and i- i just don't think that you know we as a society can afford to continue to have these people that are repeat offenders being paroled after serving	3771	A
a a fraction sometimes you know a quarter of their sentence	3771	A
but uh i- i don't know it's uh i don't own a gun	3771	A
and uh i you know i believe and i adhere to the thought that	3771	A
you know if you so often i mean it's it's having a gun leads to tragedy	3771	A
and at the same and at the same time	3771	A
i think i have thought before what would i do if i were accosted	3771	A
you know	3771	A
a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in Houston and was robbed	3771	A
broad open daylight in the parking lot	3771	A
so anyway it it is it's a scary situation and i really don't know what this what the answer	3771	A
yeah i've i'm i'm a firm believer though that uh our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence	3771	A
uh and- and knowing that the parole uh will come uh uh just in a short matter of time not only that we have people in jail now that i mean if had a program on Sixty Minutes i mean that they have telephones	3771	A
in their jail cells it's absurd	3771	A
yeah so i mean i don't know	3771	A
yeah i don't know it's yeah	3771	A
oh yeah i got three how about_1 yourself	3727	A
oh you've got uh young children then	3727	A
oh my goodness that's great	3727	A
what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or	3727	A
two boys	3727	A

i don't blame you well-	3727	A
well	3727	A
well we got two boys and a girl also- well we got two boys and a girl well uh	3727	A
yes yes so maybe- maybe maybe you'll get lucky and get a girl this time	3727	A
well our boys one is uh	3727	A

kind of	3727	A
well it's a program for	3727	A

i got a brother-in-law just got back from a trip to Alaska	3731	B
and uh he said that was quite a bit of fun uh i guess the salmon are pretty good fighters and uh they went uh out in the you know more of the deep sea fishing as well caught a fair amount of halibut	3731	B
and they say the halibut are are a pretty good fighter too	3731	B
they're an odd fish i don't know if you ever seen- i guess they lie on the flat on the bottom of the ocean and they only have one eye or or just a small eye on the other side	3731	B
as halibut	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
do they put up a fight or not	3731	B
once you get them over- to over to the side of the boat because_1 they're they're pretty pretty weighty fish are they yeah do you net those or i guess you have to huh	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
you know i've never eaten catfish are they good eating	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
is that right	3731	B
kind of an ugly looking fish are they great big whiskers on them_1	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
oh yeah	3731	B
taste a little better yeah well these trout that we catch are real good i- i quite enjoy those uh they this place where we go with uh with my six year old they uh filet them for you right there for only like ten cents a fish i mean it's well worth it	3731	B
so you just fry them up right	3731	B
okay uh	3731	A
what kind of fishing is there up in Utah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
well i was i was raised on Alabama coast and i like salt water fishing	3731	A
and Dallas is there's quite a few lakes around here i've	3731	A
done some fishing from the shore i don't have a boat which you really need to get out into the lakes uh you know really do any good	3731	A
i've	3731	A
i've caught a few striped bass from the shore some of the small ones	3731	A
and then catfish and stuff i haven't done a lot since i moved to Dallas	3731	A
oh	3731	A
off and on for ten years we were here	3731	A
six years and my wife got homesick we moved backed to Alabama Mobile spent about eight months and moved back to Dallas because_1 the	3731	A
wages and all were better up here	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
right	3731	A
yeah i did that a couple of times the company i had worked for in Mobile they had a	3731	A
couple of bunch of us guys got together and we and chartered a boat and	3731	A
went out caught red snapper and one guy caught a ling	3731	A
and i caught a few what they call trigger fish	3731	A
but the it wasn't	3731	A
yeah and we'd constantly getting our lines tangled up with people- people fishing on both sides of the boat so	3731	A
it was one uh fish were good but it was kind of a hassle	3731	A
um	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
um	3731	A
okay well we we catch flounder on the coast which is about the same thing	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
uh well they hug the bottom they	3731	A
they don't run that much but they they	3731	A
somehow they hug the bottom and it's kind of you find- it's a pretty good struggle to put them_1 in you know pull them_1 in once they get	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
uh	3731	A
i've caught i've caught one on a hook with live shrimp i've	3731	A
caught several of them_1 in cast nets	3731	A
yeah about yeah you would have to net them_1 to get them_1 in the boat because_1 they really have a small mouth and all	3731	A
but i've i've fished mostly you know	3731	A
when i was on the coast in the in the bays and stuff in a little you know plywood skiff	3731	A
and	3731	A
well the water's kind of brackish so i	3731	A
i catch a mixture of salt water and fresh water fish right with	3731	A
right on the coast you know i catch	3731	A
catfish in the bayou and go	3731	A
a half a mile and catch a you know salt water fish	3731	A
yeah they they real good they	3731	A
and so that i guess	3731	A
you know people on the coast and all consider them that's the best around	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah they they	3731	A
yeah they are and they're bottom feeders if you	3731	A
if you get them_1 out of real muddy water then they got a muddy taste to them_1 but if you	3731	A
you know catch them_1 out of clear running water they they're pretty good	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
what kind of hobbies do you find yourself involved with	3733	A
huh	3733	A
yes	3733	A
ah uh woodworking um very little actually uh	3733	A
no um	3733	A
oh no they- they uh they they suggested a variety of possibilities and of whatever hobbies- hobbies you can come up with uh no uh	3733	A
my hobbies kind of vary from time to time depending on what kind of time i've got uh i spent twenty years as an auto mechanic	3733	A
and i i enjoy working with with cars uh i've built a couple of race cars uh	3733	A
uh yeah um	3733	A
also- i do enjoy woodworking- uh	3733	A
uh cabinet cabinetry type woodworking	3733	A
um	3733	A
i've done some model building and	3733	A
different things like that um	3733	A
right now hobbies pretty much tend to be on hold	3733	A
with a twelve week old baby and	3733	A
full time student hobbies are a extreme luxury	3733	A
you say- you say you uh sing with a group in a community college	3733	A
what sort of music do you work with	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
yes	3733	A
that sounds like a lot of fun	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
those are usually the best sorts	3733	A
i you you say show music like Broadway musical type show music	3733	A
okay	3733	A
hum	3733	A
-those are wonderful shows	3733	A
oh yeah yeah	3733	A
yeah well the the chances are these are all all things they're very familiar with and just the chance to have some entertainment and some some variety in their life	3733	A
at- at retirement homes i mean even still there are variety there- there're a lot of	3733	A
retirement homes that try to make it sound like it's a real you know luxury condominium setup but- still the you know the bulk of the people living there tend to be living pretty restricted lives	3733	A
so something like that can be a lot of fun	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
uh-huh	3733	A
oh yeah	3733	A
oh that sounds	3733	A
well i find myself involved in um singing with a group at the local community college	3733	B
and also embroidering and especially cooking i like to uh cook and uh have been in charge of various events	3733	B
and sometimes i embroider when i have really a bit of spare time	3733	B
now it seems you're interested in woodworking	3733	B
what kind of woodworking do you do	3733	B
uh oh	3733	B
i thought that's what they said um-hum	3733	B
oh i see um-hum	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
i see	3733	B
um-hum um-hum	3733	B
oh you have	3733	B
oh my	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
yeah	3733	B
oh my uh-huh	3733	B
uh-huh	3733	B
uh yes um	3733	B
well we we work with show music and with uh opera arias and actually we're very fortunate to have a um	3733	B
former opera singer uh from New York who is relocated to	3733	B
Dallas and uh she has taken over the the vocal music department at one of the community colleges here in Dallas and uh she both gives private lessons and has um	3733	B
a variety of classes especially on Saturdays for um people that are interested and what i found- i've been going over there for about three or four years now	3733	B
and what we found is that there winds up being a core group of us that um keep on coming back	3733	B
and uh we give performances at the college and at the uh Botanical Gardens in the spring time and at various retirement homes and things of that nature	3733	B
and you can um select whatever things you want to work on for the semester and she'll help you with them and give you um lots of good points and uh it it's a very	3733	B
enjoyable group uh it's not um overly formal that you have to worry it's not professional but it's good and i enjoy it very much	3733	B
yeah uh-huh	3733	B
right uh-huh i've i've personally done some things from Camelot and from My Fair Lady you know things like that um	3733	B
uh and uh some of the people really are just very	3733	B
fine singers we kind of enjoy one another	3733	B
so uh and and when we go out to those retirement homes or the nursing homes	3733	B
the people are very very appreciative which also makes you very happy that you're able to kind of pick up somebody else's life also so	3733	B
right um-hum	3733	B
yes	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
oh yes	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
yeah	3733	B
i i really uh that's really what we have found and also um a lot of the people are very knowledgeable	3733	B
uh in in the field of music they're just very knowledgeable about a lot of things and they'll come and talk to you afterwards and um	3733	B
you better know your onions but uh it it is something i do enjoy very much so and the other thing i like to do is	3733	B
uh cook i have um uh	3733	B
uh planned uh menus for various organizations and this year i was asked to take care of uh several luncheons and dinners up at my children's school	3733	B
and the next thing that we're getting ready for is a big faculty luncheon and we're gonna give them Italian food	3733	B
really	3729	B
you know i just did last week as a matter of fact um i'm wondering if their subject is more uh products by mail or things that you buy at the store but um	3729	B
i bought something through the mail through a merchant through a company that's generally got pretty good products and	3729	B
i was really impressed with the way they handled the return policy they sent UPS to our door to pick it up free of charge which is such a an unusual always have to go to the	3729	B
post office or some place to return it usually	3729	B
it was Hannah Anderson the children's um clothing	3729	B
do they	3729	B
it really is	3729	B
it took a while because it was the holiday weeks um	3729	B
it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive we're we're fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but	3729	B
it would've probably been an inconvenience if if it had been a home pickup and and we hadn't been here but they were also willing to pick up at work	3729	B
it was defective we returned it for the same thing um in a little larger size but it seemed that it was stitched uh around the collar such that the second time she wore it it uh it ripped	3729	B
and and i think that's unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that um	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
yeah	3729	B
exactly yeah and it it's unfortunate you really cannot depend on the the department store's name for that necessarily i don't know if you have Nordstroms in Dallas	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably carry- carry overall pretty good merchandise you you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store	3729	B
yeah surprisingly	3729	B
no	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
um you know i don't know that i bet they probably do but i i'm not sure that i've	3729	B
associated some of what i've seen as lines that they always carry as their own brand or just something that they've um gotten at a at a lower uh price because it's a large volume some of their children's lines	3729	B
i tend to look there for kids' things because they don't they they sometimes have things that you can't find elsewhere because_1 they have a pretty large variety but not often for myself	3729	B
not that much actually i used to i think before i had a child and because you end up paying for the shipping and handling and everything um	3729	B
and you don't always have the convenience of returning it if it's not right uh i- i tend less often to do that today than i might've ten years ago	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
exactly	3729	B
um-hum um-hum	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider it you	3729	B
you find that it's a lot more inconvenient to have to arrange for returning it if it's by mail	3729	B
yeah it is funny you know i'm also amazed at uh	3729	B
that i read about those i don't know anybody who does this but that people buy clothes and wear them and then think that they can return them	3729	B
that's what	3729	B
uh-huh was this Spiegel by any chance	3729	A
don't know that one i know Spiegel does that and yes and uh to me that's very impressive to think that	3729	A
but well and did you have any problem obviously had no problem with returning it	3729	A
oh well	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
did	3729	A
did you return it because it was defective or because you just didn't like it	3729	A
huh	3729	A
well i know what you mean because a couple years ago i remember i was in one of the nicer department stores and looking at it was one of the designer T-shirts or some sort of thing like that and the thing	3729	A
it was very expensive you know as they always are and it was a piece of junk you know stitching was terrible i think that they were trying to just you know play on a name	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
no we don't i've been to one of the Nordstroms in um uh New York	3729	A
nice store	3729	A
do you really	3729	A
do you have Lord and Taylor there	3729	A
um uh we're originally from Saint Louis and we came down to Dallas and they have Lord and Taylors here and i look at a lot of their house brands and i am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands in some of the stores	3729	A
does Nordstroms carry their own house brand	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
do you shop by mail quite a bit	3729	A
it's not as inexpensive-	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
that's the only problem that i see because uh my sister gets tons of catalogs and passes them on to me and i look at things and they have some gorgeous clothes but the problem is that	3729	A
you can't always go by sizes you know you'll go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different manufacturers and they all fit you know differently but uh that's the main thing is that i can't tell	3729	A
whether the thing is going to fit or not	3729	A
and so i tend not to mail order	3729	A
but	3729	A
i-	3729	A
well personally i always try on before i buy anyway i just it amazes me when i talk to people that they buy like they buy a bunch of clothes and they don't try anything on they take them home	3729	A
oh okay well that's a different story right	3729	A
i hear about that too and that just appalls me i mean that's stealing really	3729	A
my name is Ferrell	3752	B
where are you calling from	3752	B
Miami i'm in Utah	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
yes it is definitely	3752	B
sure go ahead	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
i uh have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years	3752	B
and uh i'm almost convinced there's a lot of it has to do with environment uh	3752	B
she taught in a poor area poor area here in Utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the S A T scores	3752	B
in all the districts of the state	3752	B
and uh	3752	B
the district we're presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from from home	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah well you know you see these documentaries on uh on Japan for example and the uh rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week	3752	B
uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do	3752	B
now we have that to a to a degree here that's only because we have a little bit of a of a problem that's i guess peculiar to Utah and we have a a high population of young young people	3752	B
young children one of the larger uh uh student teacher ratios you know average class size is probably thirty five or something like that	3752	B
and that poses another problem where the you know just the individual attention that's needed sometimes uh is lacking because of the you know the shear numbers of it and what they've gone to is a year round program here where	3752	B
uh in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round	3752	B
but you have uh you go like for uh eleven weeks and you're off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these these four periods rather than than the classic summer vacation	3752	B
these are just mostly the elementary grades however	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
oh	3752	B
regardless of where they live huh	3752	B
oh	3752	B
oh that's that's interesting it's kind of like uh turning it over to the private sector to some degree	3752	B
and the the supply and demand works yeah	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
that's an interesting concept	3752	B
yeah yeah i i the stories you read about the competency and the literacy of the high school graduates for example	3752	B
i can't believe it you	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah their their awareness of the of the uh current events and geography like you were mentioned early	3752	B
uh uh i just find it	3752	B
are you ready-	3752	A
i'm calling from Miami	3752	A
Utah well we've got a long distance connection tonight	3752	A
you ready to start i am	3752	A
well you know the first thing i thought about whenever uh i don't have children but i um have a friend who's a school teacher and uh	3752	A
she has told me some horror stories but uh other than that i was thinking about um the the fact that uh so many uh kids nowadays can't even identify on the map on a globe where they are	3752	A
and it's just astounding to me	3752	A
um	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah and i think you're right i think an awful lot of it has to do with uh the kind of emphasis that uh	3752	A
the the children get uh at home on education because um uh this friend of mine who's a school teacher was telling me she said uh you know uh	3752	A
that she has uh uh kids that uh are are Indian and Pakistani uh Oriental you know some of them who uh have only been uh in the United States maybe for two generations	3752	A
that uh she said their English is excellent uh their their social- social skills are good and uh you know why is it that uh that they can be such model citizens and uh yet	3752	A
you know other young kids- uh uh kids who have you know been uh born and uh bred here in the US uh just don't seem to get it	3752	A
right	3752	A
yeah i'm beginning to wonder if maybe um year round school would not be a bad uh a bad thing	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah well i don't know i uh i uh	3752	A
i don't certainly don't have the answer to it i know that uh um in Houston uh for example where i'm i have some friends who uh uh	3752	A
were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that uh uh they want their kids to go to	3752	A
and uh	3752	A
yeah right and uh the idea of running a a school	3752	A
sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful uh uh uh less successful get less money uh	3752	A
yeah the	3752	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3752	A
but i don't know if that's the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way	3752	A
oh it's a nightmare	3752	A
well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write	3752	A
it's scary	3752	A
uh-huh	3752	A
all right Miss Kathy so uh what do you do do you do it regularly and so forth	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
well uh i have been so busy working i just retired about two weeks ago	3767	A
thank you my exercise basically has been what walking that i can get in	3767	A
which hasn't really been quite enough but i could very definitely tell the difference when i have two or three hours off and i run around on campus i'm retired from Penn State University	3767	A
and when i have an afternoon to walk around on campus i- i very definitely uh see a difference	3767	A
and it it i know that walking is good for you and uh i keep reading that it's much better for you than running because of the uh actions of the joints and so forth	3767	A
but uh tell me about_1 um your exercise did you take your exercise because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or whatever	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
how many how many hours a week do you estimate that you perform these things	3767	A
an hour a day uh-huh	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
do you ever have time when you don't get this exercise in and notice that your weight goes up or anything like that	3767	A
oh it's so you you can tell the difference	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
i- i understand what you're saying well what about eating do you uh	3767	A
do anything about the the type of food you eat is that uh or do you just eat a normal balanced meal to go with that	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
yeah that that does keep you busy	3767	A
so you well uh	3767	A
well there're just two of us now my three children have all moved out	3767	A
so uh diet wise uh i'm trying to keep us on a low	3767	A
uh weight the low fat type of a diet my wife has high cholesterol	3767	A
so i'm trying to keep that down and and i do notice that when you go through	3767	A
periods uh such as Christmas and so forth where you eat out more often than normal if you don't get the exercise in your weight weight goes up	3767	A
and uh for me exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing -that weight down	3767	A
and-	3767	A
no it's up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say walking around on campus picking up mail and and doing things like that	3767	A
and running- running downtown uh during my lunch period	3767	A
well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in and	3767	A
yes	3767	A
do you we have a bicycle in the house	3767	A
uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do	3767	A
have you ever tried one of those	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
uh-huh -well i was thinking with you say you have four children	3767	A
with four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you	3767	A
well very good	3767	A
well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh as i say i've just retired so i'm just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and i'm	3767	A
considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control	3767	A
no i have one lives in Amsterdam Holland and uh one lives in uh	3767	A
near Warrington Pennsylvania and the other one is in New Jersey	3767	A
so	3767	A
well i- i have done research at Penn State i've i've uh not a teacher i've done research in under water acoustics	3767	A
it's been a noisy subject	3767	A
um yeah i do i play basketball on uh a city league and	3767	B
volleyball and	3767	B
how about_1 you	3767	B
oh congratulations	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
huh	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
yep	3767	B
um i do it purely for enjoyment in fact when i've started exercise programs that i felt like i had to do you know a system of doing so many sit ups and that i haven't stuck with it and haven't enjoyed it either one so	3767	B
i decided that i would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what i like more than just individual	3767	B
um whatever	3767	B
um probably	3767	B
at least an hour a day	3767	B
yeah do and i have four children so that keeps me busy too and they're all involved in	3767	B
sports mostly soccer so we	3767	B
once they're out there i you know i get out there and kick it around with them sometimes	3767	B
of course of course	3767	B
oh yeah not so much with weight as much as just not you know you feel sluggish and you get into that cycle where you don't want to exercise and so you don't and then you the the vicious cycle where	3767	B
