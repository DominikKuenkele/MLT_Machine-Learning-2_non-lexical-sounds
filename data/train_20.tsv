um-hum	3763	B
uh baseball	3763	B
well i've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers	3763	B
uh	3763	B
more so with uh	3763	B
uh their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that that closely	3763	B
but uh since- you know since i live here so close to Arlington uh	3763	B
that's the team that i've been kind of following	3763	B
um-hum	3763	B
right	3763	B
well i think that uh	3763	B
you know with uh	3763	B
so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um	3763	B
you know i think	3763	B
i'm not real sure about that- do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's uh	3763	B
yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit	3763	B
yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five million- that's a lot of money	3763	B
yeah they are	3763	B
um-hum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to	3763	B
i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh	3763	B
uh pay him what his salary's going to be	3763	B
uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent	3763	B
and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway	3763	B
but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the six- you know the six million dollars a year this year	3763	B
uh-huh	3763	B
oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him	3763	B
yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh	3763	B
Pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the Rangers are concerned i think	3763	B
i think they need some definitely need some pitching	3763	B
uh	3763	B
and so i you know i	3763	B
um the pitching coach	3763	B
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was going- was helping out uh	3763	B
his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh	3763	B
oh you don't like Howse huh	3763	B
oh Tom Grieve	3763	B
yeah i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet	3763	B
but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they	3763	B
that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and	3763	B
um	3763	B
you do huh	3763	B
that's contrary to uh popular belief you know	3763	B
oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know	3763	B
they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and	3763	B
and uh	3763	B
yeah	3763	B
are you there okay now tell me your favorite team	3763	A
yes	3763	A
okay i think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed	3763	A
so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers	3763	A
what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do	3763	A
well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his	3763	A
yes and the Rangers go up a little bit um-hum	3763	A
i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest	3763	A
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous	3763	A
no	3763	A
that's right	3763	A
what i saw on the news today that Buechele- Buechele was back just to visit	3763	A
i'm awful sorry he's not still	3763	A
oh i'm sure it was	3763	A
Pittsburgh yeah	3763	A
yes sir	3763	A
well what do you think of Howse	3763	A
who is the coach for the pitchers	3763	A
yes	3763	A
his assistant	3763	A
um-hum	3763	A
i really wish they could	3763	A
see fit to get rid of Howse	3763	A
no no i really don't	3763	A
and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of Howse and i'm not fond of Grieves	3763	A
yeah	3763	A
well i'm just gullible enough that i think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right	3763	A
and i'm sure well	3763	A
oh i know i know so but i would like so much	3763	A
for these Rangers to get their act together and give um	3763	A
oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs	3763	A
i understand	3763	A
well	3763	A
i just oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and let's us have-	3763	A
do work in a large organization now	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
oh yeah that's pretty big	3724	A
i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees	3724	A
i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um	3724	A
besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss	3724	A
yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one	3724	A
right everyone's so integral	3724	A
um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too	3724	A
well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know- in a larger	3724	A
really in health care uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh vacation and	3724	A
and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits	3724	A
uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without	3724	A
um-hum um-hum	3724	A
right that really gets prohibitive	3724	A
yes i've heard that too	3724	A
it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um	3724	A
my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't	3724	A
he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the security of an organization's benefits	3724	A
it- it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand	3724	A
um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it	3724	A
the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical	3724	A
yeah	3724	A
you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh	3724	A
a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer	3724	A
so as as of this date my husband and my kids are free because_1 they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if	3724	A
exactly	3724	A
um well i- i work in a actually it's sort of an odd situation right now but uh	3724	B
i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization	3724	B
and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago	3724	B
but it's it's not really a large organization but uh nearly- nearly five hundred people	3724	B
yeah how about_1 yourself are you	3724	B
that's	3724	B
uh-huh	3724	B
hum	3724	B
yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh	3724	B
ooh yeah i i think it it's probably- the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah-	3724	B
yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's	3724	B
it's generally important	3724	B
but	3724	B
um um-hum	3724	B
what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things	3724	B
yeah	3724	B
yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent	3724	B
yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean- it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses	3724	B
and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations	3724	B
also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization	3724	B
and uh	3724	B
i you- you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them_1 i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um	3724	B
um typically let's see uh typically the myself i- i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in to- for them to be covered but it was pretty economical	3724	B
um especially relative to just buying your own health care package	3724	B
yeah and so you know- so that's that's handy uh you know i think that it- i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead	3724	B
uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary	3724	B
and which is which is pretty amazing	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
right are	3724	B
oh well um-hum yeah that's good- i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think	3724	B
um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
oh uh-huh copayment uh uh-huh	3724	B
right	3724	B
yeah i- i mean i	3724	B
typically- you- typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um	3724	B
you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping	3724	B
well how do you feel about um putting an elderly family family member in a nursing home	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah oh i agree i it's it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel um	3702	A
i- i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families	3702	A
and yet i understand um well we may be facing that with my grandmother she lives- is living near my parents out in California	3702	A
and they this year they moved her into a um retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care	3702	A
but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and	3702	A
it's it's difficult because i know my mother feels really um torn about it she doesn't want to	3702	A
to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the the place is like um	3702	A
i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and	3702	A
um and yet it's a real burden to her to have to to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah i uh i was thinking you know it might	3702	A
i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there	3702	A
um because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's it's been negative where the	3702	A
and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time	3702	A
then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've i've been to other places where you know the people have told me um this is a really good place the people here really care about us so	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah well no um but all the years that i've been alive she has um for the last thirty years or so	3702	A
it's Central California	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
yeah well this is Fresno uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
i'm not too happy about the idea although	3702	B
i do realize that sometimes it becomes necessary to do that or to have round the clock kind of health- care available in the house	3702	B
which often is is not that um easy to to do sometimes it really is easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be given	3702	B
i'm very happy that in my life so far i have not had to do that kind of a thing um	3702	B
my own mother lived with us for some years and uh just died peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life and uh i never had to face that personally	3702	B
and uh what do you think you might do in such a situation	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
oh	3702	B
oh yes	3702	B
i see	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
uh-huh	3702	B
that's right um-hum	3702	B
yeah people are just not as home as much as they used to be um sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet and	3702	B
um and therefore uh they have to leave the older person all the by themselves or with the care of somebody else and some of the diseases that uh older people have uh do require more intensive surveillance	3702	B
so uh it it isn't easy i suppose one of the	3702	B
uh best things if you are considering a nursing home is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations i know i always trust the opinion of a	3702	B
close friend uh above just what i might read about a place if somebody i knew and cared about liked a place and said no this was good and	3702	B
we were happy about the personnel and the care et cetera and so forth i would it certainly would go up in my estimation	3702	B
and uh sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best uh place is um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
yeah	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
well there's hope i guess uh has uh your grandmother always lived in California	3702	B
oh	3702	B
i see yeah	3702	B
yeah what part of California is that	3702	B
oh i see we used to live out there in the San Jose area so uh you know i'm kind of familiar with the state of California and like it very much yeah	3702	B
but um uh it's uh it's a difficult situation uh sometimes also when you get involved in the	3702	B
in those residences for the elderly the retirement homes and and also uh maybe even the nursing division of a residence home	3702	B
um it's tremendously expensive and sometimes they ask you to uh	3702	B
um well where are some of the places you've been	3794	B
um-hum	3794	B
well i've been a lot of different places uh	3794	B
Hawaii Japan Europe	3794	B
and and-	3794	B
most of the fifty	3794	B
i haven't been to Alaska yet	3794	B
yeah i thought we might go up on the uh inland ferry that goes up there from uh from British-	3794	B
right	3794	B
yes	3794	B
oh yeah it's a long desolate stretch but well desolate in that it's all uh the same scenery after a while just like driving in the desert you know after a while it all looks the same	3794	B
huh	3794	B
no no	3794	B
well actually Hawaii is getting cheap too because uh	3794	B
with the economic uh	3794	B
situation- uh situation we're in they've lowered the prices uh quite a bit	3794	B
where do you stay when you go to Virginia on the beach	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
yeah i bet	3794	B
well if he's a landscape architect he ought to like Washington DC in the daylight hours	3794	B
your dad's in the military	3794	B
retired- retired	3794	B
well being from uh living in Texas you probably like cool weather on your uh vacations at least we do	3794	B
uh	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
well usually vacation time July August September it's time to go somewhere else	3794	B
oh yeah	3794	B
um	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
no no i haven't	3794	B
yeah i saw the Sixty- Sixty Minutes also last year we went to uh the Oregon coast and- and that is really beautiful	3794	B
and it's also unlike California completely because it's cool enough that you don't have uh the surfers much because they need protective clothing you know	3794	B
and- and uh there's really uh several nice places to stay along the coast there	3794	B
we stayed at what was called the uh kite capital of the world what was the name of that city- place	3794	B
Lincoln City	3794	B
and it is really nice uh we a very nice place on the beach and very reasonably priced compared to California particularly	3794	B
so- in fact most of the	3794	B
that's right most of the Californians that uh want to stay on the coast apparently the families and so forth they come up to Oregon and Washington coast to stay because it's much uh more economical	3794	B
yeah we've we've been up that way and well this that trip we also went to uh Vancouver and out to uh Victoria which is very nice	3794	B
well you got you haven't been to California either then	3794	B
well if you go to California don't go to Los Angeles unless you really want to just see the movie stars set up and so forth	3794	B
but uh San Diego and San Francisco are both very nice right	3794	B
i don't know about you but i haven't had any trouble having any fun on vacation	3794	A
i can't think of any place i wouldn't want to go to take one	3794	A
oh i know a real good place is Virginia	3794	A
it's real nice	3794	A
it has mountains beach whatever you want	3794	A
have you been in any great places lately	3794	A
oh now i haven't been there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
you plan on going	3794	A
oh yeah now i'd like to go uh to Canada on the boat	3794	A
my parents went not long ago	3794	A
or to Key West have you ever been to Key West	3794	A
is it pretty	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
oh no	3794	A
no i've never been huh is it very expensive	3794	A
not compared to Hawaii huh	3794	A
really	3794	A
well that's nice to know	3794	A
well that's good	3794	A
um yeah i've been to Virginia Beach and i've been up to the uh homestead in hot springs in the mountains it's real nice	3794	A
and uh oh let's see i've been to Charlottesville through Monticello uh my husband's a a landscape architect and he uh he really liked that and to see Thomas Jefferson's home	3794	A
yeah now we we went there went there to stay at the Army Navy club with my dad and that was real nice that was real nice	3794	A
uh no he used to be he he's a retired attorney now uh but he was the uh he was uh uh	3794	A
in the reserves for quite a long time and uh he's active in something right now i forgot what it is	3794	A
but um i he's somehow connected still with it	3794	A
yeah sometimes- sometimes you know when it in when it's getting really hot in Texas you know you want to go someplace cool	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
have you ever been to Arkansas	3794	A
now i've i've been but not to way up at near Branson oh i hear it's just booming up there now	3794	A
up around Silver- Silver- Silver Dollar City have you been there	3794	A
i heard on uh what was it Sixty Minutes or something a lot of the country western um people are starting to build their nightclubs up there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
really	3794	A
how about population is it very uh crowded	3794	A
hum	3794	A
oh	3794	A
oh i bet	3794	A
really i bet but- but it's not as crowded either	3794	A
huh	3794	A
yeah i'd like to go up around Washington sometime to see	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
well i think the furthest west i've ever gotten is the Grand Canyon	3794	A
no huh-uh no	3794	A
oh i won't	3794	A
no no no	3794	A
really	3794	A
i know my grandparents have been to San Francisco years ago and they said it was real nice-	3794	A
well i could do with a lot less than that	3782	B
i live in Dallas	3782	B
oh good well i live in Plano in that case	3782	B
oh yeah i do yeah	3782	B
yes	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
i know	3782	B
and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i don't know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and that's how it started with uh four percent five percent	3782	B
and all of a sudden here we are now	3782	B
and it's horrible	3782	B
well	3782	B
it's true but they did without it all those years	3782	B
and they keep talking about the state tax and they'll probably put one in and they'll have this too so	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
well i hope it doesn't but you know how it goes so	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
raise them	3782	B
oh	3782	B
oh well it will	3782	B
probably the first season	3782	B
but they're funny about things like that here	3782	B
they really are when i came here you couldn't buy beer couldn't buy a drink nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know	3782	B
so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
oh that is	3782	B
oh	3782	B
hm	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
that is	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
hm	3782	B
oh yeah that is	3782	B
uh uh they well they do a little bit but um	3782	B
it's it's like next to nothing i've seen it it's on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
it costs what	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
really	3782	B
God	3782	B
yeah so you haven't been here very long	3782	B
you haven't been here very long	3782	B
two years	3782	B
um-hum	3782	B
uh yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
no i don't i'm a nurse i work down at Presbyterian	3782	B
yeah oh it is you know they're supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least that's what i heard that you could- could get to do ten calls	3782	B
and this is like the seventeenth	3782	B
yeah so it's great	3782	B
so what do you think about the uh income taxes	3782	A
where do you live	3782	A
okay i live in Dallas too	3782	A
okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i-	3782	A
yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax	3782	A
it i think it's like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there	3782	A
Washington DC was only six percent	3782	A
and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half	3782	A
it was only four percent	3782	A
really	3782	A
um-hum um-hum	3782	A
what	3782	A
since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because_1 Virginia does have a state tax	3782	A
um-hum hm	3782	A
yeah it	3782	A
if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset	3782	A
because_1 i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck	3782	A
uh every two weeks and uh if that comes back in	3782	A
i'll be pretty mad because_1 sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know	3782	A
so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax	3782	A
yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes	3782	A
and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing	3782	A
they're putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because_1 of that yeah they said uh to build okay	3782	A
apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds	3782	A
and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds	3782	A
well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes	3782	A
but it seems like it would pay itself off	3782	A
so you know what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know	3782	A
yeah so you know	3782	A
yeah things like that you know	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
no huh	3782	A
um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe	3782	A
but uh like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties	3782	A
and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh	3782	A
on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up	3782	A
you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year	3782	A
and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year	3782	A
but that gets real expensive	3782	A
do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know	3782	A
um	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks	3782	A
so it's only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your property- personal property tax	3782	A
for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess	3782	A
that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out	3782	A
what's that	3782	A
i've been here about two years now	3782	A
but uh in the two years i've i've been here i've been through i've had two cars	3782	A
so i've never really like you know	3782	A
i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax	3782	A
on the car other than what i paid when i registered- uh registered the car	3782	A
so that's the only thing i can really think of	3782	A
so so do you work for TI or you just doing this	3782	A
okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool	3782	A
oh do they really	3782	A
yeah i- i don't know how the thing works uh	3782	A
oh really all right you	3782	A
yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be	3759	B
i haven't had any real uh recent problems with that i've been a little bit leery i have mail ordered uh a uh video camera from New York	3759	B
and i was worried that that might uh cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
just can you hold on just one sec	3759	B
i got a six year old that's going out of off of his mind he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
do you buy um do you buy much mail order	3759	B
do you buy much mail order	3759	B
uh-huh have you had any problems with that at all	3759	B
oh uh-huh	3759	B
oh yeah	3759	B
well some some places are good about sending them_1 out by UPS or or other ways but	3759	B
i think most of the time i uh maybe it's just the kind of shopper i am i will uh decide on the kind of thing i want and	3759	B
try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and and generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but	3759	B
uh maybe it's the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i'm saying	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh well at least they're	3759	B
trying to uh give you some kind of concession there	3759	B
i'm trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back	3759	B
i bought some clothing i don't know if you get these Lands' End catalogs	3759	B
they uh make mail order clothing and most of it's very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years	3759	B
and um they've been very good with the exception of one that had the uh button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it	3759	B
and uh	3759	B
no they're real good in fact i've had the shirt for uh actually i probably had it for over a year	3759	B
and the only reason i called them_1 on it is because i'd had similar shirts that held up for several years	3759	B
and uh they said uh regardless that you've you know worn it for a year or over a year we'll uh take it back and give you a new one	3759	B
huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
right	3759	B
well i think that's uh that's really just good business you know	3759	B
if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do you've got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back	3759	B
you know that's like i've seen on this mail order if they were uh skin flints about it and wouldn't take it back	3759	B
i mean they they uh depend on that kind of a reputation so much	3759	B
you know	3759	B
oh yeah this they're sporting aren't they uh-huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
uh-huh you said you'd bought uh cars recently what kind of cars have you {boughten}	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
uh-huh you haven't had any problems with it though huh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
what's your feeling about American versus foreign and	3759	B
did you hear the topic Carol	3759	A
right	3759	A
oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been	3759	A
you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted	3759	A
you know for a good part	3759	A
yes	3759	A
oh	3759	A
i think i think the only problem i've had in the last two or three years is i was- i was in Germany a couple of years ago and	3759	A
bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didn't receive everything but you know that's you sort of take that chance you buy something like that	3759	A
pardon me	3759	A
oh a little bit	3759	A
no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands	3759	A
i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item	3759	A
you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and	3759	A
two days after i bought them i picked them_1 up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh	3759	A
get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over	3759	A
he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference	3759	A
which i thought was fair	3759	A
sure	3759	A
but overall i think i'm uh	3759	A
no	3759	A
right	3759	A
any trouble getting it back	3759	A
sure	3759	A
i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they don't have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything	3759	A
so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
oh absolutely	3759	A
yeah mail- mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk	3759	A
right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if you're dissatisfied with it in anyway and they're very easy get along- get along with and they don't mind taking something back	3759	A
i bought a Lincoln	3759	A
and uh	3759	A
up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit	3759	A
it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now	3759	A
no not really you know it's like the old uh saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true	3759	A
but they don't build them like they used to but	3759	A
uh just about_1 um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last ten or twenty years	3704	B
and um i guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field	3704	B
that uh of course when i was growing up not very many women went to work at all most everyone was at home	3704	B
and some of my friends whose mothers were teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their mothers weren't at home	3704	B
yes and uh but nowadays it's just so common	3704	B
a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that i've had children i've stopped uh working	3704	B
that it's kind of embarrassing when i go to a store and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work number please and then i don't have a work number to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
yes	3704	B
that's true	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right	3704	B
right	3704	B
no and it wasn't like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it's it's pennies but for them it's just a socialized behavior	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
that's true that's probably true	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right me too	3704	B
well that's good in in in our homes we all have a lot- uh much more high tech compared to the people ten twenty years ago	3704	B
right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right we	3704	B
load up on all of the conveniences and they're not special to us anymore just a	3704	B
necessity and there's the people who don't have televisions are	3704	B
are uh you know unusual in our society	3704	B
um-hum um-hum	3704	B
what was the topic	3704	A
i said uh	3704	A
right- right	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah	3704	A
yeah really	3704	A
uh oh	3704	A
there there was a stigma attached to it	3704	A
and- and a necessity	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
uh-huh	3704	A
yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i- i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work	3704	A
yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i- i thought well	3704	A
you know in a lot of different ways i- i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much it's changed i mean uh	3704	A
uh i live in Houston but i'm i'm in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami it's i mean honestly English is almost a second language now	3704	A
uh you know with all the uh influx of uh South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh	3704	A
i- i guess a majority in Miami you know of- course in Houston uh you've got the people from Mexico so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh	3704	A
the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh	3704	A
you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and- and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country	3704	A
plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh	3704	A
you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted	3704	A
uh you know thirty years ago uh a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event	3704	A
and- and- and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i i'm not sure of that	3704	A
oh yeah	3704	A
that's right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event	3704	A
and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month they'd have a stroke	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
oh well- and you know microwaves	3704	A
oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have three televisions you know and i really they're two well	3704	A
one of them_1 is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in six months i mean it's there you know	3704	A
and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones	3704	A
um	3704	A
that's right that's right	3704	A
yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh	3704	A
issue i've run across a few people before that- that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know people look at them_1 yeah like yeah you know but-	3704	A
and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not	3704	A
okay Carolyn what kind of dress do you have to wear when you go to work	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
uh well in my company we do have to dress up and they don't say that you have to um dress in a dress for women but they strongly urge it	3701	A
so it's it's kind of an unwritten law	3701	A
right	3701	A
exactly it's puts puts forth a better image it's uh my company doesn't usually have casual days we had our first one in four at least since i've been there which is four years not too long ago and	3701	A
i didn't feel comfortable dressing like many people came in like warm ups and no and i	3701	A
yeah and i don't feel i- i wore you know a nice pair of pants and and blouse but i- i- i just couldn't feel comfortable in my warm ups around everybody at work	3701	A
oh well it was just recently so i don't know if they'll do it again the way some people looked i would doubt it	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
i don't know i it just seems if you want to get ahead or even if you just want everybody to think of you you know as a a professionally you you don't just want to have the real casual look all the time	3701	A
well we've got two hundred people in our office but we're the corporate office so um it's it's relatively large but i mean i have a job very much longer so i- i don't want to say too much	3701	A
exactly we have to hold the image for everybody	3701	A
i would like to you know i dress as nicely as my budget allows	3701	A
and and you know i mean it's it's a lot better than some people there and it's not as nice because i don't have the money of others you know what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
so you don't work with many women	3701	A
and i work with all women	3701	A
and my husband does well not all but the majority and my husband he works in a bank and he works with all women	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
at least at the lower levels you know	3701	A
okay	3701	A
what about season to season do you change	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
exactly i- i do the same and that's what basically keeps my wardrobe i may wear a few really warm dresses in the winter but i don't i don't change a whole lot because it's it's we're environmentally controlled you know	3701	A
you end up wearing the same thing	3701	A
below the knee	3701	A
i- i- i don't have nice knees they're kind of knobby so	3701	A
on the knobby side i what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
halfway up the knee	3701	A
you must have better	3701	A
oh okay-	3701	A
oh okay	3701	A
i- i- i'm thinking halfway between the knee and your say your hip	3701	A
well it that it is but i know a lot of women who who do wear those skirts and they have been reprimanded in our company before	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
also i was going to just mention that i wear what you know my my wardrobe- my wardrobe how should i say it i wear what i can fit into	3701	A
oh yeah fat months thin months you know	3701	A
exactly the same for me but i'm working on it but i'm not doing a very good job at this point	3701	A
i haven't gotten serious yet	3701	A
that's right that's right but i'm so used to eating now it's hard to get out of the habit	3701	A
uh i can actually wear anything i want to however i generally wear uh suits or dresses	3701	B
how about_1 you	3701	B
well the company that i work for uh we it's very casual we don't see any people there's a plant out in the back and then i'm in the office section	3701	B
and we always had casual day on Friday which meant you could wear jeans or whatever you wanted to which to me dressing down is you know like wearing pants and a jacket or something	3701	B
but uh	3701	B
even though i don't have to dress during the day you know in anything that dressy i still feel better i feel more professional when i'm dressed up	3701	B
you're kidding that's casual	3701	B
uh-huh	3701	B
would i assume that perhaps they did that one time and that was it	3701	B
well that's what i always thought actually uh the gals in our customer service department quite honestly came in every day in what i considered casual but	3701	B
um-hum do you work for a large company	3701	B
well and it and it affects uh you know being in the corporate office how you have to dress too do you	3701	B
do you tend to dress up toward your superiors as the books kind of	3701	B
i understand	3701	B
um-hum	3701	B
uh i have never i really have not worked for very many companies that i had a female role model	3701	B
um the we have some i'm sure in our corporate office but i've not met them yet but uh the last few jobs i've had well there was two jobs ago there was a girl in the office uh that i tended to try to emulate somewhat but uh	3701	B
no not too many	3701	B
i've	3701	B
do you really	3701	B
majority	3701	B
i'm sure that's true i used to be in banking and you're right the majority of the people there	3701	B
uh	3701	B
exactly-	3701	B
what oh someone never mind that's a call coming in but	3701	B
we'll pass that	3701	B
um i probably get a little bit more casual in summer	3701	B
in then in that i would wear a more casual top under some of my suits	3701	B
than i would wear in the winter	3701	B
but our offices are rather cold so i i'll tend to try to dress warmly too	3701	B
well tell me another thing	3701	B
uh how do you wear your skirt lengths	3701	B
