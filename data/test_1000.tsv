hm	2678	A
yeah	2678	A
yeah i'm pretty much the same way you know people always say wow the- the meanings of those words and i'm always meaning there's words- well you know i just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know	2678	A
right yeah that- whenever they say it two or three times	2678	A
i'm the same way yeah it's funny um depending on where you live i i i commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury which is	2678	A
two and a half hours away and the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different you know when yeah because_1 Baltimore'll play more um what might be considered more- little bit more progressive	2678	A
and as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town that's you know uh two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever uh in the real rural Baltimore- uh Maryland they it turns into basically classic rock	2678	A
and they don't you know yeah mostly oldies but classic rock you know with- if you know like when the Doors movie came out you know Doors was really on the radio there	2678	A
you know where you know you'd hear what's one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in Baltimore but in Salisbury you would- that's all you would hear was this is the Doors you know so was sort of a funny thing	2678	A
you	2678	A
you	2678	A
yes that's i'm starting to realize that i never really thought about that much but there is	2678	A
yeah i never	2678	A
i never i didn't i i lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore and i didn't i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area	2678	A
i really didn't notice at all it just seemed the same but when i went more rural you know that it really changed so	2678	A
oh does it yeah	2678	A
yeah	2678	A
um-hum	2678	A
right yeah boy that would really be beneficial because_1 you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio i never get it	2678	A
you know and if you don't if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in the car all the time	2678	A
yeah that's pretty good	2678	A
um-hum	2678	A
um-hum	2678	A
yeah yeah in fact	2678	A
my- my uh my grandmother does that a lot because_1 she's blind or what- she's losing her sight or whatever but yeah that of in i can imagine you know if you're driving cross country	2678	A
you know uh listening to a story lot of the classics are really on tape yeah	2678	A
yeah that that would be good	2678	A
well we strayed a lot from music but i but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening so as long as you're listening so	2678	A
but if you do if you do have to go something i guess we can just cut off	2678	A
well Jack it was nice to talk to you and- and good luck and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls bye	2678	A
hello	2680	A
hi i'm Sally	2680	A
nice to meet you	2680	A
oh okay all righty	2680	A
yes	2680	A
um-hum	2680	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2680	A
yes and then there's a mistrial right	2680	A
uh-huh	2680	A
yeah i agree with that i really do i you know there're two kind- sides to everything and- and i	2680	A
you know i was i've never been on a jury i've been interviewed a couple of times but never got picked and um	2680	A
i just really have mixed feelings about it because you know i i'm not sure that i'm for the death penalty and yet when i think if something happened to one of the members of my family if somebody you know killed them or	2680	A
brutally beat them or whatever i uh and killed them i i don't know that i would could- be be able to say that	2680	A
so you know it's i have mixed feelings so if if i were to ever serve on a jury i would have to be honest about that i'm not sure that i could give somebody the death penalty	2680	A
and and so i'm not you know i agree with you i think that uh that um	2680	A
a majority for uh you know a less severe case would be okay but i think for a death penalty it would be have to be everybody	2680	A
i agree	2680	A
uh-huh	2680	A
i've always said that i you know i i think that would be the stiffer penalty but we have such a problem with over crowding right now that	2680	A
exactly	2680	A
exactly and and yet on the other hand you i feel so badly when i see people	2680	A
when i read about people in the paper that have gotten out when they've raped somebody or beat somebody or aggravated assault or whatever and they're out in you know a few weeks or a month or	2680	A
i think that's criminal because most- most chances are they'll do it again but they have to let them out in order to make room for other people	2680	A
and if you they also mentioned about a judge you know doing the verdict well	2680	A
i had an experience with that because my i have a brother-in-law that was um did- made a mistake and he uh	2680	A
was working as a financial planner- planner and they the the company he was working for did a few things that was against the law and the Internal Revenue found you know found out and prosecuted them and he ended up going to jail	2680	A
and he's a wonderful man and the bottom line was that he was greedy he money and all that stuff but	2680	A
when when he went to jail i saw the the side that i had never seen before because we would go and visit him	2680	A
and the judge was the one that was not lenient with him he really throw threw the book at him even though he was- he had so many character witnesses and so many people that that came forth for him and	2680	A
he was tough and so sometimes probably the judge might be a little bit more severe- severe than the jury would	2680	A
because don't	2680	A
exactly	2680	A
um-hum	2680	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	2680	A
um-hum	2680	A
oh	2680	A
oh my word	2680	A
isn't that awful	2680	A
yeah and you know i also feel like if a judge has has the last say	2680	A
i- i don't care what job you're in you know what social service type job i'm a teacher	2680	A
after a while unless you really watch it you begin become hardened to people's problems and they don't quite mean as much to you you detached yourself from them and i think that might happen with judges too	2680	A
i think that they they wouldn't be too lenient with certain people because they're they're so hardened to the fact that you know there's a reason why all this happened and they don't want to hear the story anymore they just want them to you know go to jail or be punished	2680	A
so i agree with you i'm not too sure i would like to have a judge be the sole	2680	A
you know delegate of uh of a a sentence	2680	A
yeah and especially and i hate to say this but especially if he's a minority or she's a minority	2680	A
uh people have a tendency to automatically sentence people that are Black or or Mexican or any kind of an immigrant before they've even heard	2680	A
and that's sad that	2680	A
oh sad commentary on our times but it happens	2680	A
right	2680	A
exactly and and the rich people get off the hook	2680	A
it's really is sad	2680	A
but have you ever served on a trial- on a jury	2680	A
have you ever served on a jury	2680	A
yeah but didn't get selected	2680	A
um-hum well i always thought that it would be real interesting but	2680	A
one the one one of the ones that i was came down for was had to do with um	2680	A
drunken driving and um	2680	A
you know i don't think i could be partial in a case like that i just- i just uh feel like that that you just shouldn't drink and drive and and i	2680	A
i could not be lenient at all and they asked me a couple of questions and i think	2680	A
you know they came to the conclusion i couldn't you know i would i'd probably throw the book at a person that that harmed somebody drinking and driving so	2680	A
row uh-huh	2680	A
uh-huh	2680	A
right away they	2680	A
yeah	2680	A
yeah i'm sure that's true i'm sure that's true	2680	A
well and it's the law is is very tricky and and we all come from different backgrounds and we come from different experiences and so we bring to that jury	2680	A
different perspectives which in a way is good because if we all thought the same way a person that was uh	2680	A
possibly innocent or possibly not as guilty as you know as	2680	A
as uh you might think would you know get the book thrown at them or whatever because we're all we all feel the same way but	2680	A
i know that- i have some friends that have been on juries that have been deadlocked and it's no fun i mean because	2680	A
no	2680	A
that's right and especially hard on the people that are not along going along with the majority because the the the other jurors get so angry because they want to go on with their life they want to get out of there	2680	A
and if you don't truly believe what you think and stick to your guns it can be awful uncomfortable	2680	A
so	2680	A
oh is that right oh that's good	2680	A
yes same with i'm a teacher and and we do too	2680	A
so which is great- is great	2680	A
oh wouldn't that be awful yeah that would be terrible	2680	A
exactly yeah	2680	A
you're right you're right and we just kind of have to	2680	A
to go along with it and do the best job we can if we're called it is a duty a lot of people i know try to get out of jury duty when they're you know and i would never do that because i feel like hey we live in a country	2680	A
where we have this you know privilege and i would never that's my duty to be as a citizen of the United States and if i got called i'd do it but some people don't feel that way	2680	A
oh gosh isn't that awful- that'd be awful um yeah we're lucky to live in the United States there's no doubt about it	2680	A
but let's see i really don't have anything else to say about jury and	2680	A
okay well it was good to talk to you all right	2680	A
you too bye-bye	2680	A
hello hi	2680	B
i'm Jerry Crow	2680	B
and i uh made a mistake i went ahead and punched one so we're on	2680	B
okay the trial by jury	2680	B
uh my thinking on the uh uh	2680	B
unanimous decision	2680	B
i think they should only i think they ought to change that to only in death penalties	2680	B
that it be a unanimous- unanimous i think in the others they ought to have	2680	B
not a majority but say three fourths or something like that	2680	B
because too many times they get hung up	2680	B
and there's a mistrial	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
and uh i'm not so sure that well	2680	B
a it would cost a lot more but i'm not so sure that	2680	B
life in life without parole is not the stiffer penalty- penalty than the death penalty	2680	B
but	2680	B
yeah yeah plus it uh it would cost the taxpayers quite a bit more money	2680	B
and uh	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
make room for others	2680	B
yep	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah i that's the problem i have with judge giving sentence	2680	B
is that there's not consistency	2680	B
uh	2680	B
it varies even from state to state and even within state	2680	B
because i remember i was watching uh i think it was either Hard Copy	2680	B
or Current Affair one of those programs last night	2680	B
and this poor uh immigrant had bought some land	2680	B
and had cleared the land there was uh uh uh fill there people had use thrown old tires and junk and everything else in the land	2680	B
and they prosecuted this guy and fined him like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or something like that for disturbing water lands	2680	B
and he cleaned it up it was even cleaner than when he bought it	2680	B
and it's just you know ridiculous	2680	B
and uh	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
right	2680	B
i just uh like you say i just- i just hear too many cases of	2680	B
of somebody committing a small or a a minor crime and getting a much stiffer penalty- penalty than someone else that commits a major crime and gets off lightly	2680	B
right	2680	B
right	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
and uh also they didn't say anything to talk about it but uh	2680	B
the rich people can hire the the uh	2680	B
top notch lawyers	2680	B
and the poor folk	2680	B
is more or less at the court's mercy	2680	B
right	2680	B
but i guess i	2680	B
madam- ma'am	2680	B
i've got uh i got a summons before but i never got selected i was like you i spent all day down at the courthouse sitting there	2680	B
and didn't get selected	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah the only one i i got uh not selected but as a as a uh perspective jury member was uh a uh rear end collision	2680	B
and of course i guess there was probably thirty people or forty people there and they called them down	2680	B
and they asked if anybody had been ever rear ended to hold their hand up and i had	2680	B
and uh i think they	2680	B
right away they said well this guy	2680	B
won't	2680	B
give a uh	2680	B
won't will be partial	2680	B
yeah yeah i wouldn't want to be sequestered- sequestered for a week and be locked up in a hotel or a motel or hotel or whatever	2680	B
right	2680	B
right	2680	B
and uh i guess uh i'm fortunately in working for Texas Instruments should you get hung on a jury you do get get your normal pay yeah	2680	B
so uh	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
it would be hard on a person that uh	2680	B
if he did not get that pay to get locked up for two or three weeks on a hung jury and be out	2680	B
the time on the jury plus missing his pay check	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
but i guess i guess it's like like a lot of other things in in	2680	B
states uh	2680	B
it's not perfect but it's better than anything else is	2680	B
that's out there	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
right	2680	B
yeah-	2680	B
yeah all you got to do is read in the paper every once in a while and see where somebody went down to Mexico and had a car accident and got thrown in jail and spent two or three years there	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
yeah	2680	B
but uh	2680	B
i i believe i'm about uh	2680	B
exhausted my-	2680	B
okay you too and you have a good day bye-bye	2680	B
um to Williams College in Massachusetts	2630	B
no but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts	2630	B
about two thousand	2630	B
very excited yes uh i have another son who's at their chief rival Amherst College	2630	B
well they're they're they're really very strong academic rather than you know big sports	2630	B
we're outside of uh Washington in Maryland how about you	2630	B
uh-huh do you have children in	2630	B
okay um	2630	B
well i i one of the the advises we've given our children is that you can always learn a job	2630	B
uh but what you can't learn uh on a job is	2630	B
a good solid well rounded- well rounded education	2630	B
that's right you know the Renaissance man and uh and if you get that you can and if you do well you can you can learn a job	2630	B
that's exactly right	2630	B
that's right so the advice we gave to them was number one visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all	2630	B
the size school that you might be interested in	2630	B
do you want to go away how far from home do you want to be	2630	B
what do you want in a college now my son is a national level competitive swimmer	2630	B
so he wanted to swim in school but he did not want to be in a swim factory	2630	B
that's right that's the University of Texas at Austin or Stanford or something like that so he didn't even consider those	2630	B
uh-huh	2630	B
uh-huh	2630	B
he is very very strong academically yeah so we've just but you know he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked and yet he he did wind up having to make a choice he did apply to a large you know large group	2630	B
it's got about nine thousand undergraduate	2630	B
yeah yeah	2630	B
yeah	2630	B
uh yes and it but it does have the under you know that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the uh the college of arts and sciences is you know i guess about four thousand	2630	B
at Pennsylvania	2630	B
Williams is an undergraduate school only um and it's a total of two thousand	2630	B
yeah so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment but he did go on college visits and he liked	2630	B
um-hum	2630	B
yes yes it's large and they both boys had decided no that they did not want that	2630	B
oh it's so you	2630	B
uh-huh	2630	B
and did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner	2630	B
okay	2630	B
no but we've been there when i'm up at Williams we've gone up there	2630	B
oh it's it whatever we went and he was you know impressed by the clean air and he he met the students at both schools and he liked them	2630	B
uh-huh	2630	B
that's okay- the the thing is if if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field than you're not then it's probably good to go to you know to apply to a school with a strong technical program	2630	B
but uh for if you're going into if you know engineering is the thing if then you've got to at least take engineering	2630	B
that's right	2630	B
uh-huh no he didn't apply to any school further the furthest away was Bowdoin in Maine which is about twelve hours	2630	B
yeah that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours and Williams is about seven	2630	B
yeah so well i mean he so it wasn't he you know then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train and then Bucknell in mid state Pennsylvania	2630	B
yeah and he knew and he came down i mean uh he- he came he's been talking to them and and he came down and one of the things that	2630	B
he said is he went to Pennsylvania this weekend and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time	2630	B
but then he said you know it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun	2630	B
and he said it almost backfired- i think it backfired	2630	B
so	2630	B
um-hum	2630	B
yeah well	2630	B
of course that period too was probably difficult to for you but i did uh my advice to him and my husband's- was that	2630	B
uh he had to really decide what he wanted out of college he had to look at himself uh in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip	2630	B
and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where especially in a Kenyon or a Williams where you see the professors around town all the time you skip class in the morning and they see you	2630	B
that's yeah yeah and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you uh so that and he will know the professors in a small	2630	B
uh-huh	2630	B
yeah yeah	2630	B
that's right that's right and um and it's just the personal contact where if you need help	2630	B
he has i told him to look to yourself are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred that you're really going to look him up but if it's a class of fifteen	2630	B
and you need help you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures	2630	B
and even though they may break it up into smaller groups uh Penn is known for having	2630	B
graduate assistants teaching they have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups	2630	B
just a he made the decision uh i'd say about uh an hour and a half ago	2630	B
yeah i mean that's so funny i mean and and in fact he had just an hour before that two uh recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him	2630	B
and uh i mean and he they were really nice and but he said is that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better	2630	B
yeah yeah	2630	B
right now yeah	2630	B
my other son is just as happy as a bed bug he the moment he knew he he decided early on that Amherst was the school he's a classical guitarist	2630	B
and he decided he also got into the Yale graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar but he decided he was going to go to the um	2630	B
the smaller now and then graduate school later	2630	B
well he's really my older boy's real happy and he's minoring in English	2630	B
and he had thought about economics and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't	2630	B
he's um he's gonna be a junior he'll be he's finishing his sophomore year so he's double majoring	2630	B
well you know see the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this you know go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two	2630	B
yeah	2630	B
well one of the things we said is that they should pick the college this was our advice too irrespective of the cost that somehow we would manage	2630	B
well we place a real high priority on education in our family	2630	B
oh good that's wonderful	2630	B
oh that's great	2630	B
that's right that's exactly	2630	B
okay he did where'd he decide to go	2630	A
uh-huh sure i'm familiar with it	2630	A
and he well he must know is he interested in law or medicine he must have a definite profession in mind	2630	A
oh okay	2630	A
medium size aren't they	2630	A
is he excited	2630	A
wow i can i	2630	A
uh-huh while they're east coast i mean i don't know anything about their football but there you go	2630	A
yeah that's where where you at	2630	A
oh okay i'm in uh suburban Dallas	2630	A
uh no i don't i have a husband we don't have any kids yet	2630	A
about all i can say is i guess about picking schools um i guess uh if you don't know what you're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea um	2630	A
this is true	2630	A
right the humanities the history yeah	2630	A
right right no no no	2630	A
yeah but they you know if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company it will if it's worth it's weight will subsidize and	2630	A
uh-huh	2630	A
this this is true	2630	A
yeah	2630	A
and if you want to go away right	2630	A
right	2630	A
good	2630	A
okay so he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at they'd in Austin Texas University of Texas	2630	A
right	2630	A
Texas Aquatics- yeah okay well that's i think the other thing is too um i know i went to a uh city high school in Chicago and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say my brother and i were and economics was the choice um	2630	A
sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school	2630	A
uh-huh	2630	A
yeah University of Penn i'm originally from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania- University of Pennsylvania	2630	A
yeah that's strong i mean that's you know and it's it's well it's a little bit i don't want to use the word wilder that's not the word i want um more diverse	2630	A
at Williams or Pennsylvania at Williams at Pennsylvania well how large is Williams	2630	A
right	2630	A
well that's not bad	2630	A
which is a lot yeah	2630	A
uh-huh	2630	A
um-hum	2630	A
that's the thing to do i mean i not having any children my husband was an Ohio State person and uh that has something like either the first or second largest	2630	A
student population like fifty thousand combined community	2630	A
yeah that is too much and i mean i um i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at Bennington in Vermont um and that was this was twenty years ago showing my age um	2630	A
yes oh my God where are you from well let's not talk about that	2630	A
it's um in that area i mean i just can't say enough about it	2630	A
well you know um my husband's an engineer and a strong liberal- a strong liberal arts background with uh a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a a strong um business administration degree than with another MBA on top of it	2630	A
uh-huh	2630	A
and they usually	2630	A
yeah but they usually don't	2630	A
right but they no but who does i mean i think i think all i think the majority of people just don't know no he looked at criteria such as location size of school yeah	2630	A
that's still pretty far though i mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go	2630	A
oh that's not too bad	2630	A
yeah he will enjoy Williams i think and that's the truth is it's a good academic	2630	A
uh-huh	2630	A
that could very well be i mean	2630	A
so he's developing his his uh internal instincts right now that's good because i mean i'm sure what he said was true that uh you well actually that's one of the reasons i went to uh Kenyon he went- he made a good choice i went i	2630	A
well i should- we're not supposed to but i spent a year in Vermont my freshman year it was just too far away it was too different uh the level of income of lot of the students and their attitudes was just um beyond my	2630	A
um in terms of drugs et cetera which i thought was shocking	2630	A
right yeah you're right but then i went to	2630	A
yeah	2630	A
uh-huh	2630	A
and you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline yeah	2630	A
well i don't know how to put this either in this way and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get i don't mean specifically etiquette or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background	2630	A
because i just don't think at that age i just don't think that young people know what they want to do	2630	A
you know and um	2630	A
that's right	2630	A
right right lecture yeah	2630	A
this is very very	2630	A
oh	2630	A
they have video lectures yeah video lectures	2630	A
this is true and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the did he just make the decision today	2630	A
how funny	2630	A
well he'll	2630	A
that's funny	2630	A
it was easy for him to rule out he knew what he didn't want that's exactly yeah now is your other i mean we're talking a lot about what you think but obviously you're experiencing it uh did your other son um	2630	A
a clam	2630	A
oh wonderful	2630	A
uh-huh	2630	A
the smaller and	2630	A
and they'll do fine in their studies and i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school and	2630	A
and now he's a senior- he's a senior or is this early admissions	2630	A
so he's	2630	A
so he's yeah well sounds like you have two talented sons	2630	A
i think and a lot of people talk about and it's not the economics i'm solely zeroed in on but i think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return	2630	A
and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges- colleges because of that and i i think it's rather sad	2630	A
you are wonderful parents	2630	A
no and i agree i mean my husband and i in fact i'm taking my LSATs um i'm thirty something and taking my LSATs on June tenth	2630	A
um the point being and your sons will learn this from you i'm sure that uh no matter what age you are you can learn	2630	A
and it sounds like they're going to you know they're just	2630	A
so uh what do you think	2622	B
yeah	2622	B
oh really so they have no- i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas	2622	B
oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida in New York they have it	2622	B
i mean you know like i say i'm in New York and we have a state tax as well	2622	B
so that just cuts even more	2622	B
right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place	2622	B
you know you- you don't see it going to any place where it belongs	2622	B
i think if it were to be uh	2622	B
if it were to be um	2622	B
if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door	2622	B
if if it were to be spent in the right way i think i wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem	2622	B
well that's certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um	2622	B
sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after	2622	B
but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something	2622	B
i think that- so they want to you know try and- i think they're trying i think that- i think that most of the politicians understand this	2622	B
they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing	2622	B
right	2622	B
uh-huh	2622	B
i agree	2622	B
i agree	2622	B
right exactly and then and then uh	2622	B
uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older	2622	B
you know but i'm not convinced that's a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and	2622	B
you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it	2622	B
you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places	2622	B
you think so	2622	B
i know and that scares the hell out of me	2622	B
yeah	2622	B
yeah i don't i don't well because- because they're the ones who make the laws so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess	2622	B
to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not	2622	B
i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process	2622	B
i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong	2622	B
you know all those things that really could be changed that	2622	B
aren't you know that that that aren't and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list	2622	B
so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it	2622	B
yeah	2622	B
right we don't i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another	2622	B
right	2622	B
i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um um i i've never been	2622	B
uh sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of	2622	B
um	2622	B
you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas	2622	B
when clearly their constituency does- doesn't back them up on anything you know	2622	B
and often times that will happen	2622	B
right	2622	B
right	2622	B
they do forget it's true could- because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politician- whenever the- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this	2622	B
so it becomes uh	2622	B
a general battle of	2622	B
the who- um the uh sort of election of the lesser of two evils	2622	B
i think so	2622	B
i don't know	2622	B
i just uh i'm unhappy with it but and well i'm i'm sort of semi fortunate right now i'm a graduate student	2622	B
so i don't make that much and what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school	2622	B
but	2622	B
it's	2622	B
my my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep	2622	B
especially around bonus time	2622	B
bonus she no my my wife does	2622	B
my wife- i don't- no graduate students don't get bonuses we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure	2622	B
my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a	2622	B
that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if	2622	B
that were her weekly check or something	2622	B
so she gets destroyed on her bonus check	2622	B
so she works with in in in sales	2622	B
so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses	2622	B
yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily	2622	B
until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more	2622	B
so i don't know i don't- i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it	2622	B
and hope that it gets better	2622	B
same here tough topic so	2622	B
i believe i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly it's been a pleasure talking with you	2622	B
thanks for calling	2622	B
you too bye-bye	2622	B
i think we're overtaxed to the hilt	2622	A
yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um	2622	A
uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state	2622	A
income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through	2622	A
no no state income tax	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits	2622	A
right	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
well we're	2622	A
really overburdened from federal state and local	2622	A
that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that	2622	A
there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
well they're kind of put into a trap of being	2622	A
out there to please the special interest groups as well	2622	A
and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue	2622	A
that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms	2622	A
and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody	2622	A
and uh	2622	A
uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is	2622	A
it's just taking uh a bite out of our savings	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
and i believe the Social Security tax is a great {pondsy} scheme	2622	A
yeah it's uh you know right now they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit	2622	A
and i bet that's illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that	2622	A
within their private company they'd be in jail	2622	A
so how are we letting them get away with it	2622	A
right	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and	2622	A
feel absolutely helpless	2622	A
to	2622	A
oppose a lot of the situations going on	2622	A
in the taxing system	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
hum	2622	A
well there's no quick solution or no sure fire	2622	A
easy answer	2622	A
it's just going to take uh	2622	A
uh really uh uh uh	2622	A
a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to	2622	A
come to a decisive answer	2622	A
or	2622	A
vote	2622	A
to	2622	A
limit	2622	A
the way it's spent	2622	A
see we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place that's	2622	A
right and they are controlled or	2622	A
pretty much do what they want to do	2622	A
well they feel invulnerable- invulnerable to uh	2622	A
any wrath or uh it's it's occurred so many times that	2622	A
they figure people will usually forget and	2622	A
don't think about it when the election time arises	2622	A
and generally it does work out that way	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
well when you get out into the real world then you will know	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
bonus time you have a bonus	2622	A
oh	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
so you're taxed on the bonuses too right	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
uh sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job	2622	A
uh-huh	2622	A
yeah	2622	A
well i have	2622	A
i guess about said what all all i can think of to say	2622	A
yeah it's really- a rather touchy topic at that but	2622	A
well that's great	2622	A
you too and uh have a good day	2622	A
okay	2684	A
uh my first thoughts on capital punishment is- i the first thing i want to say is- is no	2684	A
just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life	2684	A
uh	2684	A
we are punishing someone for taking someone's life	2684	A
or in some cases we are punishing someone- -someone a person for taking someone's life and so in effect we're committing that same crime	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
right	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
exactly-	2684	A
uh-huh	2684	A
one thing i don't understand is the the whole concept of death row	2684	A
okay these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die	2684	A
right okay and there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row and i'm not saying that	2684	A
well i guess i am kind of saying what what are we doing i mean i guess that's the same thing you were saying	2684	A
what what are we doing with these people	2684	A
they're they're there we should either take some kind of action	2684	A
or	2684	A
take enough or or go a different route but they're just	2684	A
oh exactly	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
exactly	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
right	2684	A
but	2684	A
and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that i'm saying that you know we're committing the same crime	2684	A
i also agree that i mean if there's somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough	2684	A
to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time uh there was a case in Dallas well i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet but	2684	A
uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell they put four people in a freezer and shot them_1 all	2684	A
now to me that is inhumane	2684	A
and	2684	A
for two people to be out in the world like that i don't i don't want them in my world	2684	A
you understand what i'm saying i i'm	2684	A
i mean i'm not for killing anyone	2684	A
but i don't want these people around at the same time	2684	A
exactly	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
right	2684	A
and	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
right	2684	A
right	2684	A
um-hum and at and at the same time like you said it drains society	2684	A
we i think we should be	2684	A
we the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and put- keep these people in prison	2684	A
that same money or half of that money could be used towards	2684	A
uh rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get to to put these people back in society but prepare them first	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
exactly	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
right	2684	A
um-hum and you- you want people out of prison you want people to get jobs and and live happy lives	2684	A
but they can't just walk out of prison and do that they can't just walk out of prison and say okay i'm going to go a different route	2684	A
there has to be some sort of	2684	A
buffer in there some sort of program or and i know this costs money but it couldn't cost anymore money than we're already spending	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
really how what can we do	2684	A
oh goodness i mean you know everyone's trying to make it	2684	A
you know in their own little world you know i'm trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my family okay	2684	A
and it's so hard to you know try and	2684	A
be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them_1	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
oh yeah	2684	A
right	2684	A
and i i'm a broadcast journalist and so i feel like one day i probably will	2684	A
write a book or or something you know and some of these views will be able to come out i work at channel six	2684	A
here i'm a i'm a news reporter	2684	A
and so i i guess i'm i'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now	2684	A
i've only been in it for a year but i get to see pretty much uh close up	2684	A
you know a lot of things that happen that people don't see	2684	A
uh i got to see- get to see a lot of crimes and i get to see you know people's	2684	A
uh pain and things and so when we talk about	2684	A
yeah	2684	A
exactly-	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
a service	2684	A
yeah	2684	A
but still you know we can't shut we can't	2684	A
i don't i	2684	A
i guess i would like to probably editorialize more	2684	A
we have to just report what's happening we can't say well this is what i think about you know the situation sometimes	2684	A
you really want to say that you really want to say what you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone or you know	2684	A
that's a	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
especially when you are dealing with a a subject like	2684	A
uh capital punishment or something or abortion	2684	A
or something where there's an an no or yes side and you have your side and you have to report both sides	2684	A
but you really don't want to because you have your side	2684	A
yeah yeah so sometimes that's hard but	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
um-hum	2684	A
okay good	2684	A
all right well it was nice talking to you	2684	A
okay okay bye-bye	2684	A
i think you got it	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
well it sounds like you have really strong views on it	2684	B
and i can see that point but i also have this you know i	2684	B
i question i guess i can look at it both ways and just to play devil's advocate	2684	B
it never seems right to me that uh we take in people that are criminals and people that are you know	2684	B
low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families	2684	B
our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people and it just	2684	B
that that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
i agree with you there	2684	B
um-hum um-hum	2684	B
it	2684	B
right	2684	B
exactly	2684	B
and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs	2684	B
you know we could be paying- feeding poor people and helping you know	2684	B
helping the environment i mean prison is such a waste of	2684	B
a human being it doesn't do anyone any good yes people need to be punished and i do agree with your statement	2684	B
that to take a human life is wrong	2684	B
um but you know locking someone up and not getting	2684	B
you know any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
oh exactly well-	2684	B
that's right that's right	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
we want a safe environment for ourselves and we want to remove them	2684	B
but but i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution	2684	B
that is acceptable that does you know	2684	B
basically you know i i think you know that the whole idea of	2684	B
uh a a death penalty was invented for two reasons it removes- -removes them from society	2684	B
and number two it's it's kind of uh it's the punishment it's the ultimate punishment	2684	B
because you know they've harmed someone and and	2684	B
you know you want to	2684	B
appease the people that have suffered	2684	B
but it	2684	B
it really doesn't take their pain away	2684	B
um-hum but it's a	2684	B
exactly-	2684	B
exactly but that the problem the problem is so incredibly complex i have a friend who works on the pardon and parole parole- paroles and she interviews	2684	B
inmates all the time that are coming up for parole and she says it is just really frightening	2684	B
how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded	2684	B
and these people have not	2684	B
benefited from the stay there she says	2684	B
just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong	2684	B
and there's not anything she can do to keep them in you know if they meet certain guidelines	2684	B
you know and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work	2684	B
so it's	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
that's right	2684	B
that's right	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
i know i know i i would like to see	2684	B
the money that's been budgeted budgeted for new prisons	2684	B
being put into the research of of an alternate solutions to the problem	2684	B
how are we going to fix that Tanya	2684	B
how are we going to make that happen	2684	B
what power do we have	2684	B
oh	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
that's right	2684	B
hum oh i know i know	2684	B
but it it it sounds like you are uh you know interested in what's going on around you and	2684	B
and uh you know when you have a a voice you do	2684	B
contribute and i guess that's you know what what we're meant to do and maybe an opportunity will come by that	2684	B
we will have a chance to make a real change	2684	B
oh where where do you work	2684	B
oh you do	2684	B
that's great	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
exactly	2684	B
right most of us are so sheltered you know	2684	B
and a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there	2684	B
well that you're you're really performing a a benefit to society in doing that	2684	B
um	2684	B
uh-huh	2684	B
i i'm just i'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to	2684	B
just to give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about	2684	B
uh you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint	2684	B
and you're right that has got to be a challenge sometimes	2684	B
right	2684	B
um-hum	2684	B
right	2684	B
and you have to walk right down the middle with it	2684	B
yeah	2684	B
i'm sure	2684	B
well that's that sounds interesting and i'll read your book some day	2684	B
i enjoyed it thanks for calling bye-bye	2684	B
when i'm driving to work i listen to a radio station which is twenty four hour news and that's how i get most of my stuff that gives me about uh	2686	A
thirty minutes thirty five minutes each way each day so that's about an hour and hour and ten minutes worth of	2686	A
uh KRLD	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
uh	2686	A
i don't usually watch the news at night time because_1 uh i'm you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it's already over and	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
pretty much yeah because_1 they have the uh CBS uh world news on- on the hour on the radio so i get all of that stuff then plus i get all the local news	2686	A
uh what do you think i don't know that's pretty strange	2686	A
yeah you know i mean uh with- with- like with regard to the Soviet Union we're telling the uh	2686	A
Soviets you know hey the Baltic States wanna separate go ahead and let us separate that'll be good you know what- what if the American south wanted to separate like they tried to do in eighteen sixties would we be so forgiving and say ah sure go ahead form your own country	2686	A
you know i mean seems kind of hypocritical- hypocritical of us to to be telling other countries to like go ahead and let part of their country separate off you know and Gorbachev he's the one who wants to keep his country together which i can understand you know	2686	A
and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the Soviet Union i don't blame them either	2686	A
it's not something	2686	A
that's something that they got to work out for themselves we shouldn't be involved in that we shouldn't even be talking about it you know the government should just stay away from them people and just let them figure out for themselves what they need to do	2686	A
yeah Bush should not do anything but as as- as for the rest of but though i don't you know we get the paper on the weekend	2686	A
and i'll i'll flip through that you know once or twice but not won't- won't read it cover to cover	2686	A
and uh	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
i do that all everyday so that's another way but that's mainly you know that doesn't have like a whole lot just a few things on there which is	2686	A
huh	2686	A
i didn't see it	2686	A
is that right is that up	2686	A
wow	2686	A
should've sold	2686	A
the building i was in well- it- guess you work for TI too	2686	A
i guess you work for TI too	2686	A
oh	2686	A
yeah you got {surplused} i got- i got {surplused} last year myself yeah	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
another organization yeah they-	2686	A
they needed somebody just like me whereas before i was not even doing what i was supposed been doing but uh that's not that's not the topic i guess but uh	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
it did quite a bit better	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
oh gosh	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
yeah it's gonna be a tough time for- all around the country i mean you look at the look in the paper and you see all the stuff about you know layoffs here layoffs there and you think oh man what's gonna happen	2686	A
you know thank goodness General Dynamics got that big contract because_1 that'll least bring some money to the area	2686	A
General Dynamics and Lockheed and Boeing	2686	A
Lockheed and- Boeing on this	2686	A
yeah but Lockheed i used to work for Lockheed and at the time i was there they were developing the prototype for the uh that fighter	2686	A
and so it was pretty big stuff there then now they got the contract for it so	2686	A
well they're they're in in partnership with uh Lockheed and- and Boeing yeah it's a it's a threesome	2686	A
no McDonnell Douglas lost out they lost the contract they were in partnership with Northrop and they lost the contract and so	2686	A
yeah	2686	A
yeah there you go old Jerry can use that	2686	A
yes have a good day bye	2686	A
so how do you keep abreast of the world's happenings	2686	B
what station's that	2686	B
KRLD i listen to uh ninety point one which is KERA	2686	B
so uh that's the same way i do it i drive about thirty minutes to work twenty minutes actually so listen to that going and coming	2686	B
uh-huh	2686	B
what a deal	2686	B
well do you feel like you're kept abreast	2686	B
uh-huh	2686	B
well what do you think about the US telling the Iraqis to get out of their camp areas	2686	B
it's a it's a different bold move i mean uh with still regardless if we won the war or not it's still uh the country is Iraq	2686	B
uh-huh	2686	B
exactly	2686	B
um-hum	2686	B
yeah	2686	B
um-hum	2686	B
yeah it's it's an interesting uh kind of a catch twenty two	2686	B
that- that is uh	2686	B
that is a bit difficult	2686	B
um-hum	2686	B
um-hum	2686	B
do you read T News at work	2686	B
yeah that's uh i used to read that all the time	2686	B
uh-huh did you notice what TI stock closed at today i didn't either	2686	B
i hear it's forty two though yeah no it- well a couple of weeks probably about a week ago it was at forty seven	2686	B
but that was uh i believe because of the stockholders' meeting	2686	B
yeah exactly exactly	2686	B
pardon me	2686	B
i did until December	2686	B
and uh that's how come i don't read T News anymore	2686	B
did you that's that's great did- you just find a a place in another	2686	B
another TI organization	2686	B
that's kind of interesting that they can you know say get out of here in one second- and then the other side say come on over here	2686	B
so that worked out pretty well for you i was talking- talking to a guy from Colorado Springs yesterday who is	2686	B
implied or inferred definitely that he has been {surplused} from up there and he didn't know what he wanted to do he's been with TI for fifteen years	2686	B
so it's uh and he's a nonexempt uh he doesn't know what he's gonna do they're just shutting down the whole plant up there	2686	B
exactly	2686	B
uh-huh	2686	B
right who- who got the contract	2686	B
oh well- yeah i always get mixed up who's their partners with that late latest deal	2686	B
is it Lockheed and Boeing	2686	B
uh-huh	2686	B
so GD didn't get it or is not associated	2686	B
oh they are okay	2686	B
so it's i thought it was Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas or was that uh Northrop	2686	B
okay	2686	B
yeah that'll be a biggie i wonder what they do with those planes now that they've made as uh test	2686	B
test plane	2686	B
yeah becomes a new corporate jet	2686	B
there you go	2686	B
yeah exactly {alrighty} well it's been good talking to you	2686	B
okay you too bye	2686	B
okay well you	2641	A
um we got two cats	2641	A
yeah and uh	2641	A
um yeah we had cat you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies so i mean i'm used i'm used to having cats around i like them	2641	A
oh see i'm not uh i'm not a dog person at all	2641	A
yeah probably i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid in fact i may still be um we	2641	A
not um i wonder sometimes um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and um	2641	A
uh he has a dog and everything we were you know we were sitting the dog and everything and uh i felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday it was like hey maybe you're still allergic to the dog it was like oh that could be it	2641	A
yeah	2641	A
well	2641	A
dogs are real high maintenances you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot you know you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it's not quite the same thing um and um	2641	A
um you know it's	2641	A
it's just nice that cats you know cats yeah you don't have to let them outside you know our cats are indoor cats so you know they're not you worry- you're not worried about them running all around the neighborhood and you know they you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is	2641	A
yeah it's you know it's a pain to clean but you know we used to i mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans they didn't	2641	A
well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time and i hated it because_1 i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible but now they have like this you get these liners	2641	A
that is garbage bags you know and you and you you know the	2641	A
yeah the cats do it in there you pull it and take it out and throw it away and that's it	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
same idea	2641	A
everyday oh okay i see	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
so you don't have anything right now	2641	A
oh except the kid huh that's	2641	A
uh i don't i don't know because the cats pretty much um yeah you know we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out	2641	A
and um uh it's not a big deal really i mean they're they're happier when we're around but you know they they're pretty much okay by themselves um and i don't you know we couldn't do that with a dog	2641	A
well that's	2641	A
that's um	2641	A
pampering the the pet a little	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
but they're not that much fun you know you can't take them for a walk you can't you know they they don't they can't fetch you know they can't they can't do anything so i've never	2641	A
i think we had fish when i was a kid but i don't	2641	A
uh	2641	A
oh	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
no it's like i just i don't know i- i just never understood why what the attraction- i mean they're you know they're pretty and everything but i've just never seen the attraction of having fish	2641	A
it's not as much fun	2641	A
oh now we really get sick	2641	A
yeah	2641	A
like i remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha	2641	A
and uh you know used to drop mice in it's like this is not these aren't pets you know this is gross	2641	A
yep	2641	A
yeah well	2641	A
yeah well a cat will do the same trick	2641	A
i had a friend in college-	2641	A
i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while um	2641	A
i forget how she got it but it was um it was the same kind of a deal i think she got it i think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department	2641	A
oops	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
uh-huh	2641	A
oh yeah i mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts so yeah rats are not my favorite animals in the world but i could see getting one from birth and everything	2641	A
yeah	2641	A
yeah i- i i have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they they tell me the same thing i just again it gets into these aren't much fun you know what i guess they can be i	2641	A
okay	2641	A
right	2641	A
oh people	2641	A
i don't oh plus i mean their's a pooper scooper on New York so yeah	2641	A
i was living in northern Jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it we were wondering if they uh they had any special law for the horses in Central Park of course not	2641	A
hit the bags	2641	A
oh God i can't	2641	A
haven't been up there last time i was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad	2641	A
not this past fall but i mean fall a few years i mean it was- it was in the	2641	A
yeah it was almost like October of eighty five i think was the last time i was up up there and at Center Park um i had a friend who went to Colombia and i used to go up and visit her	2641	A
um so	2641	A
no they're just mutts yeah my wife got them from uh	2641	A
um friend of hers at work and everything you know you know as kittens and it was before i mean this was before we even met um she's had them for a couple years and um you know they're really cute they're they're sisters one of them is a lot bigger than the other one	2641	A
and she pushes the other one away from the food apparently i don't know all the details but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel and the other one is named Holly you know	2641	A
both yeah both females they're both spayed or whatever it is neutered	2641	A
you know um and they're they're both declawed at least on the the front claws	2641	A
so do you have any pets	2641	B
two cats	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
yeah i like having cat- cats around or pets around in general i- i favor dogs over cats actually but	2641	B
oh i'm i'm a dog person i had i guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid right	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
but not cats	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
well the thing i don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek	2641	B
of the dogs and constantly	2641	B
yeah that's true	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
limited	2641	B
oh really	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
oh that sounds so easy what i did	2641	B
yeah i house sat some cats	2641	B
for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis and what we used to do was just put um newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing	2641	B
then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasn't so bad well she had two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of cat litter there	2641	B
because if i put a lot one of the cats would had been all of her animals that she ever had were adopted is that true yeah she's even got she's got one dog now and the two cats and her	2641	B
dog there is is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him it was her ex boyfriend and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was and now she's stuck with it and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals	2641	B
no we don't have anything right now	2641	B
oh right now we have a kid but he was no completely against having a dog or cat he said they're much	2641	B
they're as much work as a kid and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend	2641	B
and	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
that's uh yeah really true but like the friends other friends of mine have cats they have four of them	2641	B
and if they go away they have they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats you know their so use to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset	2641	B
and you know they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that	2641	B
yeah i i tried to have um figured having pets so i tried to have a goldfish	2641	B
and um i killed that one within a very short amount of time	2641	B
right	2641	B
my brother had fish when i was a kid i remember that and one of his fish jumped out of the um	2641	B
gosh what do you call it fish tank	2641	B
well it was not gross i didn't see it but um he got them trying to remember we had a dog for a while	2641	B
and i don't know if we got rid of the dog because_1 my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he's outgrown now but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish	2641	B
and you they're like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have	2641	B
well a friend of mine had um an eel	2641	B
and then he had a um i forget what type of fish it was it was one of these fish that i- it would eat it ate a big other fish and things like that there would be sort of moby fish in a tank	2641	B
yeah and it	2641	B
i i couldn't see having fish like that i could see sort of having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty but	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them i mean i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and you just destroyed the mice	2641	B
but	2641	B
let's see i had a pet rat for a while	2641	B
and it was a live rat and	2641	B
um this woman just offered it to me while i was in in graduate school and she was actually a very fun pet	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
yeah mine had been a a a	2641	B
how did this work a male rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick and she said i don't think he's sick i think she's pregnant	2641	B
and then she grew to be you know i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big you know like a pound or something i don't know how much and i had her for over two years and she was very affectionate she would you know	2641	B
crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working and things like that yeah much more than you would think	2641	B
yeah	2641	B
and	2641	B
yeah i sort of weird for me to have had one too but there it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in it's cage and you know it was easy easy to take care of and but	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
actually it was more fun than you would think	2641	B
yeah starting from the	2641	B
beginning but um yeah we live also live in the city now actually in Manhattan and so it's	2641	B
almost impossible	2641	B
it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly certainly not a dog i mean people do	2641	B
but it just not	2641	B
oh yeah you see all these people yeah these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them it's really kind of funny	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
right no they don't actually they do they have um the bags behind them but i think they're actually supposed to	2641	B
they keep them yeah keep them clean but oh gosh i can't even walk by Central Park	2641	B
yeah when summertime just the smell is so bad	2641	B
of the horses	2641	B
oh well it's not that long ago it was pretty recent	2641	B
oh twelve times of the year	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
yeah	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
yeah that's not too far from were we live do you have you said you had two cats are they um	2641	B
just what you call it	2641	B
are they breed cats or anything or are they just	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
they're both females	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
uh-huh	2641	B
go ahead	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
they never do	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
hum	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
hm	2636	A
i- i guess the biggest thing that i returned recently was a a a car seat- a baby seat car seat	2636	A
that we got um at a store and it was missing a piece there's a a clip that goes with them that uh i guess	2636	A
yeah for some seat belts or something you can't connect it without the clip and it didn't have it so i	2636	A
before i took it away	2636	A
same- same type yeah same type of store it was just uh different location	2636	A
no	2636	A
yeah in fact the way he acted it happened all the time and uh	2636	A
my wife was reading in Consumer Reports i think the week later about the car seats and apparently that's a pretty standard- standard practice	2636	A
that they only put those clips in in about a third of the boxes because not everybody needs them_1 with the seat belts that they've got	2636	A
so they just don't bother to put them_1 in in all of them_1	2636	A
so they probably get a lot of that you know	2636	A
yeah probably- yeah i think you're right it's probably hurting hurting that brand not to do that uh	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
uh-huh	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
uh-huh	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
uh-huh	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
i- i guess it depends on what you're talking about i- i think it depends- and it depends on the company too how seriously they take their their quality control and and	2636	A
just customer relations i think companies that think it's important to to have a good product and take care of the customer do a good job on both	2636	A
ends you know if there's a complaint they take care of it right away because_1 they don't want any bad PR and they do want return business	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
okay	2636	A
yeah i think probably they're having to change some of their strategies due to survival in a lot of situations uh i think the car industry is a good example of that	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
hum	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
uh-huh	2636	A
oh yeah i worked in uh produce counter at Safeway so i know that there's a lot of things that are brought in that are imported	2636	A
so yeah we do that all the time	2636	A
um-hum um-hum	2636	A
true yeah i think they're they're trying to lower costs by cheapening in a lot of areas	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
yeah that's true	2636	A
um-hum	2636	A
yeah	2636	A
well i personally have had something i had to return recently a couple of things um and i didn't have a receipt so i was a little apprehensive heading into it i really was um	2636	B
i had a pair of shoes that my daughter had	2636	B
you know tried on in the store and she got home and wore them_1 around and	2636	B
and thank goodness she hadn't worn them out anywhere you know she hadn't taken them_1 to school or outside and so i took them_1 back and	2636	B
they were they were very pleasant about it they could- you know it was a chain store i don't know if it's appropriate to say a name but you know it wasn't uh department store it was just uh you know	2636	B
lower class end of the thing and and they were they were real decent about it but i got the real impression that uh	2636	B
if i'd gotten another employee i could see her looking over you know if i'd gotten that gal hum-um she would not have	2636	B
not have been nearly as polite about me not having a receipt	2636	B
but that was a low ticket item	2636	B
i i don't think i've ever had to return a higher ticket item	2636	B
for a for a long time	2636	B
um-hum um-hum	2636	B
very important to the safety of the whole thing i'm sure	2636	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2636	B
now when you say you -returned- returned it to a different store did you take it just to a different location of the same store or just another	2636	B
uh-huh uh-huh but it didn't they didn't say well gee this was only good at did you have your receipt	2636	B
so	2636	B
huh that's interesting	2636	B
well now- i suppose they you know they save pennies i guess but	2636	B
you know now the question is would you again go buy that same brand would you recommend that brand	2636	B
to somebody or because of the experience would you just say uh don't fool with that brand it	2636	B
and it probably you know isn't well i think one thing that's kind of a change that i've noticed in the last few years i think the reps- uh manufacturer reps are a lot more on site	2636	B
than they used to be	2636	B
i think we went through a few you know that was the way it used to be in the old days and then we went through the days when you know maybe only uh one buyer for a whole chain saw	2636	B
um a manufacturer's rep and if something was broken or returned to the store or damaged merchandise the store had to eat it more	2636	B
and then we've- now we've come you know now it seems like they just send it back you know they have a lot more resources	2636	B
you know your your larger stores to regain- regain their money if it comes back you know because_1 sometimes i'll say well	2636	B
you know uh this is damaged you know and but it was fixable you know what i'm saying it's something you could bring home and repair and you'd be willing to do that repair if you got price off if you got mark down	2636	B
item- item so that you could afford to go buy the glue or the special thread it was going to take or the patch or whatever you know	2636	B
and and say well mark it down and i'll buy- i'll buy it as it is even if it is damaged because it's repairable	2636	B
and they won't do it no i can turn this back in and get full credit you know from the you know the rep	2636	B
i you know i hear that	2636	B
you know where you didn't use to hear that	2636	B
but well do you think that overall the uh goods are improving or	2636	B
or decreasing in quality	2636	B
um-hum um-hum	2636	B
i think that American manufacturers are getting a lot more	2636	B
um	2636	B
pressure to compete in quality than maybe we saw you know ten or twelve fifteen years ago	2636	B
that they're they're feeling the heat you know you see a lot of you know now uh you know the ads that come out they'll say you know ninety percent of our products you know made in the USA	2636	B
you know that kind of thing we buy we buy American so you can too you know kind of slogans	2636	B
but uh so it must be a heightened you know awareness that way the uh	2636	B
um	2636	B
one thing i've uh well i just-	2636	B
um-hum um-hum	2636	B
oh certainly	2636	B
plea you know i mean his just his advertising strategy with Chrysler you know has i think really made a lot of people rethink	2636	B
are we being patriotic if we don't buy	2636	B
we uh uh i have a Girl Scout troop not now but we did in the couple of years ago we uh we did an international kind of merit badge activity and one of the things we did is we	2636	B
had everybody bring from home at least five things from that had been purchased or you know not purchased but made in other countries	2636	B
it really uh really surprised me just to see the	2636	B
the difference	2636	B
you know and just a wide variety wide wide variety and i thought we might be seeing things that	2636	B
oh you know had come down from their family or grandfather and grandma went on a safari or you know went to Europe or something like that but it wasn't it was just everyday kinds of things that you go to Skaggs or Target and buy you know that came from	2636	B
you know Poland or China	2636	B
you know Finland or you know just really you know Kenya lots of different everyday kinds of you know items useful items lots of different foods showed up that we commonly purchase and don't even think about you know that they aren't	2636	B
stateside grown	2636	B
yeah yeah bet you um-hum	2636	B
yeah exactly	2636	B
i think uh one thing that's kind of uh uh thinking- thinking about quality	2636	B
that we see differences now like are in the new homes you know homes that are being built they have so many more amenities	2636	B
offered that our forefathers wouldn't have even crossed their brains to have expected you know a dishwasher or a disposal or uh uh	2636	B
track lighting or garage door opener you know those kinds- the fancy bathrooms and stuff and yet the sturdiness of them_1	2636	B
doesn't always- always- doesn't always	2636	B
measure up	2636	B
and yet they have to put those things in because they're expected	2636	B
you know even young couples buying a home they've lived in apartments that	2636	B
provide those things so they just assume they'll be in a home	2636	B
all they expect to	2636	B
you know to be able to	2636	B
you know we pay for it in other ways by not you know basic structure	2636	B
and yet technology is still keeping up with the times too well i think i think we're probably going to see a lot of changes in the next	2636	B
five years or so i think there's technology out there right now that's just	2636	B
on the very- on the very very edge	2636	B
oh i like it i i i have a foreign actually i have more than one foreign automobile and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters i was trying to build a shed	2610	B
and they give you these measurements like forty two and three eighths inches	2610	B
and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh	2610	B
well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that	2610	B
uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think what's interesting the way engineering people do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches	2610	B
do you are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that	2610	B
well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like	2610	B
i think it's interesting you went- you know when you you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds	2610	B
well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch but some of them like like twenty seven and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that uh don't translate	2610	B
yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well	2610	B
anyway i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't i don't know do you do you drink adult beverages	2610	B
well- that- have you noticed that um that a lot of the um a lot of	2610	B
yes	2610	B
it's like a fifth like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange	2610	B
what's a fifth of whiskey	2610	B
it was a marketing ploy	2610	B
yeah but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five and and	2610	B
um it was simply a ploy to to get people you know	2610	B
to buy to buy more for it's uh i find that interesting but it's like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in	2610	B
one one liter bottles and um i i think it's kind of generational although i must admit that that i am not	2610	B
i can- i'm not conversant in saying you know that's three centimeters away i mean or or or	2610	B
yeah and-	2610	B
it it it's hard to think though	2610	B
it's like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill conductive- bond wire on on semiconductor devices	2610	B
and well what's a mill and	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
don't you find that interesting uh that they that that they're doing that uh in any field for how- why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't	2610	B
oh okay	2610	B
the bolts were were English- were were English then	2610	B
now that's strange	2610	B
yeah uh-huh	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
essentially they do that though because if if you look at General Motors the size and and and of course Ford and Chrysler if they all went if they all went metric but in a sense um	2610	B
you know it's like when you a measurement though when when you put uh you know one point four three two inches when- when you're milling something	2610	B
uh you simply set your uh equipment or or you measure- or you got your calipers there and and you measure you know you it to see if it's accurate and	2610	B
and	2610	B
no	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
you get you a pair of metric pliers right and you beat on it and a metric hammer	2610	B
oh i think i don't think so i i think that that- uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know it's a hundred meter	2610	B
and uh uh but automobile races if it i don't think they'd ever it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred they're not going to	2610	B
yeah and and it i i don't think it i don't you know i don't think i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality uh you it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold how many ounces of gold	2610	B
you know i was trying i was trying to figure up gold content on something it had has uh gold plated uh header	2610	B
and and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce	2610	B
yeah now that makes you know	2610	B
well i mean and and then there's a metric ton and then there's a ton but what's a metric ton	2610	B
i don't know	2610	B
yeah and and then but then the medicine and and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter	2610	B
yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh	2610	B
i don't know and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this one's uh uh three pounds um and you	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
that's right	2610	B
and and	2610	B
i don't know i i think that i i think i think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems	2610	B
yes	2610	B
yeah but but are are the tools that uh if you're cutting are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for that- for set up	2610	B
huh	2610	B
so you've got thousands of dollars or so i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools	2610	B
yes	2610	B
but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
but when- you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee i need a hole there	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
yeah	2610	B
yeah and and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws and that's the other issue uh the pitch and	2610	B
so how do you feel about the metric system	2610	A
yeah and it's i forget how many millimeters so you used the metric	2610	A
uh yeah yeah	2610	A
uh yeah yeah uh i work in metal fab	2610	A
and tenths of inches are are normal and	2610	A
you know metric- you know it is broken up in you know the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for in tenths hundredths thousandths ten thousandths of an inch	2610	A
yes i am i i have a Suzuki motorcycle	2610	A
and	2610	A
and i've had motorcycles Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me	2610	A
but my	2610	A
right	2610	A
yeah yeah transfer- yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it	2610	A
yeah i drink beer	2610	A
yeah whiskey is in liters	2610	A
and and the next yeah point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters yeah	2610	A
yeah	2610	A
yeah i i always wondered about that myself	2610	A
and and they had quarts at the same time though	2610	A
yeah	2610	A
it's	2610	A
liters	2610	A
yeah it it's	2610	A
like i say i work in a machine shop and uh	2610	A
everything's still inches	2610	A
everything's still fractions of inches or parts- or tenths or thousandths or or	2610	A
yes it is a mental thing it is a conversion thing	2610	A
right	2610	A
yeah yeah	2610	A
but what really annoys me is the way we in the United States have been converting to metric	2610	A
we have a eighty nine Chevy Blazer and before that we had a Horizon uh you know Plymouth Horizon	2610	A
and	2610	A
both of	2610	A
them were a mismatch of both	2610	A
American and metric	2610	A
uh okay the engine itself was mostly metric	2610	A
because it came from Canada	2610	A
and the starter was	2610	A
Bosch American so	2610	A
yeah yeah	2610	A
it was it was annoying one one half of the starter was- you know three bolts on the starter and two of them were	2610	A
American and one of them was metric	2610	A
and uh	2610	A
you go from the uh water pump up to the	2610	A
radiator and on the	2610	A
water pump	2610	A
it was all metric and	2610	A
and on	2610	A
you know the factory fittings you know the factory uh	2610	A
screw lock uh	2610	A
uh radiator hose clamps	2610	A
yeah	2610	A
right it's it's not a problem either way like i said my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car	2610	A
and you go to look at it and you don't know which set to reach in American or metric	2610	A
and	2610	A
and you're never quite sure well is that a metric bolt	2610	A
right right	2610	A
it it can be annoying and my other concern- concern is	2610	A
is the American government going to force us to go	2610	A
oh absolutely	2610	A
yeah yeah they're not going to change that to meters it will always be	2610	A
twelve	2610	A
yeah there's twelve troy ounces to the pound	2610	A
yeah and	2610	A
and is that going to change too	2610	A
uh see- i don't remember i i read it	2610	A
and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume	2610	A
it's all metric all ready	2610	A
and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce	2610	A
and the other one's	2610	A
two point one keys and and you're you're lost	2610	A
oh yeah the economy uh what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it uh	2610	A
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling	2610	A
personal tools to be able to do his job	2610	A
uh tools for set up and for measurement	2610	A
uh you got to have	2610	A
a one	2610	A
tenth indicator it's a hundred dollars	2610	A
uh five tenths indicator- uh usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each uh five tenths indicator	2610	A
at about a hundred dollars you got to have uh six inch	2610	A
set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars you got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars uh	2610	A
one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars a two to three for eighty dollars a three to four for eighty dollars	2610	A
real fast	2610	A
real real fast edge finders and	2610	A
well i know because okay	2610	A
your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches	2610	A
you know	2610	A
what size hole	2610	A
as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole	2610	A
yeah yeah well and thread	2610	A
okay so um	2673	A
seeing we're both from different parts of the country um i imagine that uh	2673	A
social changes have happened in both areas but you know is rapid i'm not sure could you tell me some of the things that's happened in your area	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
when they were born yeah	2673	A
oh boy	2673	A
oh is that right	2673	A
uh yeah in some cases uh	2673	A
that's yeah that's early uh i was kind of young i- i got married as soon as i got out of school and started raising a family so	2673	A
uh my oldest is uh thirty four	2673	A
and my youngest is going to be twenty six	2673	A
uh	2673	A
yeah right yeah	2673	A
yeah i don't i i'm not sure about that excuse me	2673	A
is that right	2673	A
yeah the problem yeah	2673	A
well	2673	A
oh yeah but under thirteen probably what do you contribute that to then as compared to say uh uh twenty years ago	2673	A
you know with with children	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
right	2673	A
right right i grew up in kind of uh there was a rural area and there was nothing but farms and	2673	A
mostly mostly dairy and orchards apple orchards and you know peach orchards uh	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
why because we're a more mobile society	2673	A
uh people are just moving out getting jobs and our families on	2673	A
that's that's a big problem because at least i- i see that up here when when i was growing up and going to school uh people never locked their doors and uh you know you had family that was	2673	A
generally in the area most people kind of stayed put you know very few moved away	2673	A
um	2673	A
right	2673	A
yeah and i think the whole country back then was naive	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
yeah right and and	2673	A
right children have children have responsibility but i think the the biggest thing now is that uh information is is passed on a lot quicker with with TV and radio and uh	2673	A
uh children are under a lot more pressure because from their peers than than it used to be	2673	A
um	2673	A
yes right yeah	2673	A
right	2673	A
uh	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
that's right	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
um	2673	A
yeah i think i	2673	A
yeah it's uh	2673	A
a family unit yes um	2673	A
but you can't trust anybody anymore	2673	A
yes it is	2673	A
no it it goes back i guess way way back people had a lot of children and they and they they were kind of uh they most of them were on farms i guess or they worked in factories	2673	A
at least in the east you know my father my grandfather and his father before him always worked at this place so then i would work at this place	2673	A
um out in the rural areas we were always farmers or was always going to be farmers	2673	A
so you had a lot of children they kind of money didn't seem to be important back then	2673	A
so	2673	A
yeah but with a uh excuse me with a uh	2673	A
run by families or or were the younger children going out into the world and then they were bringing in	2673	A
you know labor is to to take care of the crops	2673	A
because the kids wanted something more i guess	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
yeah i- and your	2673	A
right	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
yeah	2673	A
man's changed it	2673	A
well i thought the second part of the question you know how do you perceive life in the United States differently	2673	B
you know as opposed to ten to fifteen years ago um	2673	B
you know that one my oldest children are	2673	B
are fifteen	2673	B
so	2673	B
that's huh you know that that was immediately what clicked in my head what do i see now	2673	B
different than i do you know when they were born	2673	B
you know um i have my oldest are two girls they are fifteen and fourteen	2673	B
so not quite fourteen the um	2673	B
i think we're seeing lots and lots of of changes as regarding families you know at that point i felt like i was one of the few people that truly wanted to- children	2673	B
and now i think you're seeing that a little bit more it's coming back again	2673	B
and	2673	B
but people are certainly having their children their families later	2673	B
you know it's not	2673	B
and the ones that are having them earlier they're having them a lot earlier like eleven or ten	2673	B
um-hum	2673	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2673	B
so that uh	2673	B
definitely it makes a difference my husband was quite a bit older when we married and	2673	B
we decided to you know we wanted to	2673	B
to get get our family pretty quick you know and	2673	B
um	2673	B
that was you know really a a definitely uh identifying factor you know we began	2673	B
in having a	2673	B
well i know that uh here in Dallas we have the unfortunate um	2673	B
reputation as being i think it's the fifth	2673	B
largest of uh i'm trying to think how that was fifth on the list	2673	B
of teenage mothers in the United States	2673	B
oh yeah we have i think in nineteen it seems like the statistic was for nineteen eighty eight	2673	B
in Dallas County there were	2673	B
i want to say three hundred and fifteen gosh that seems like an awful lot	2673	B
of children born to mothers under the age of thirteen	2673	B
it can't be education because you know there's more and more family related issues being raised at school	2673	B
um	2673	B
you know they're lot more progressive more pointed sex education programs all over the country	2673	B
one thing that i really see a difference and i guess you know overall uh you know that it's a negative	2673	B
is that	2673	B
you know these kids and we live in suburban- a suburban area	2673	B
of Dallas	2673	B
these kids do not have the aunts and uncles	2673	B
the cousins	2673	B
you know that built-in kind of security	2673	B
you know	2673	B
yeah i think so	2673	B
you know of course you have lots and lots of moms working	2673	B
that's right	2673	B
uh-huh	2673	B
so there's kind of a nucleus of cohesion there	2673	B
that you could rely on you know if you were ready to just	2673	B
you know	2673	B
strangle your parents you kind of had	2673	B
course there's just a different uh just different feeling as to who who's in control i don't think we ever talked about children's rights	2673	B
you know we didn't talk about women's rights you know we sure didn't talk about kids' rights	2673	B
oh yeah	2673	B
well you know i can remember as a teenager	2673	B
you know we would	2673	B
get things fashion wise you know we always consider- considered Dallas the third coast you know i mean you know feel very uh um	2673	B
always felt like we were on the edge of of new trends and you know i had a lot of uh friends and in	2673	B
Wyoming and Utah and Colorado because_1 that's where my parents were from	2673	B
and we would go there they were always seeing movies that had been here six months before and they were wearing clothes and saying lingo- using new lingo that	2673	B
we heard way before and so we always felt you know a little you know kind of thumb your nose and	2673	B
but now that's not so you know if those- those- those parts of the country aren't behind you know they're getting the movies if not you know	2673	B
right at the same time they're getting them_1 you know six weeks later it's not you know not so	2673	B
and yet i think i think we're really evolving right now i	2673	B
you know the seventies and eighties were so uh get all you can cause you may not be here tomorrow and money hungry i think we're seeing some comeback to family um	2673	B
it's it's a different family unit though	2673	B
you know it's not the same that we traditionally thought of	2673	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2673	B
when we uh moved to this particular town this a suburb of Dallas ten years ago there was still a lot	2673	B
lot of agriculture- of of land that was used for agricultural purposes and that is just you know every year just a little bit more a little bit more slips away	2673	B
i don't know um	2673	B
i think probably main- a lot of it was you know contract labor um	2673	B
yeah the kids want something more there's a great deal of respect in this area for agriculture and for the foundation that it has given this particular community	2673	B
and we still have a couple of very viable families who are you know make large contributions time money you know emotionally to the community and preservation- preservation of its heritage but we don't uh	2673	B
you know but but even their concerns are becoming more diversified	2673	B
but you know one thing that and this is just totally off the wall but it's another uh another element as we see the encroachment of	2673	B
of progress on	2673	B
just the ecosystem- ecosystem when we moved here and the the fields were mowed every summer we would have this massive influx of crickets	2673	B
from the fields into our homes you know just i mean crickets so thick you couldn't walk without stepping on them	2673	B
and course that then brought different birds that didn't normally come to our area and i don't know what all other effects on the ecosystem because_1 that's not my bailiwick but see we don't have that anymore	2673	B
so you wonder what other little	2673	B
uh-huh i was reading in uh	2673	B
i think it was the Reader's Digest just earlier in the week about	2673	B
okay	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
i agree	2667	A
uh-huh	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
ooh	2667	A
right	2667	A
it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise i know what you mean	2667	A
um well i try to um i started at the beginning of this year i decided all right i'm going to start exercising again i'm going to be real good and i went through the TI fitness center and registered for the uh aerobics classes there	2667	A
and they run for two months at a time and you have to you do have to pay to take them and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half so that was four and a half hours a week	2667	A
and it cost sixty dollars and i thought okay that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money and i had a friend of mine going so i was real good i only missed it about three times	2667	A
and then oh March came around and i signed up again and i got uh caught up with a class i was taking at TI and then i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class and	2667	A
then i went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the TI up there and so that was two weeks i had missed and boy i tell you what i've been terrible ever since then	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
uh-huh	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
oh yeah i think i've been two maybe three times the month of April and this session is about to run out now i signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of	2667	A
into a real a busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes and some of them require me to go out of town and and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off when am doing that so	2667	A
and i've lately yeah there's been nights that i could have gone and i've found excuses uh things like i- i had the flu last week but i'm fine this week i could have gone Monday i could have gone tonight and i didn't so i'm kind of	2667	A
kind of finding excuses and now it's kind of like well this is the last week i'll just start fresh next week but i better do better do it and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months	2667	A
wasn't the second two months she started taking tennis lessons and so i haven't had that extra motivation of of us forcing each other or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go so	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
yeah i'm the same way	2667	A
yeah	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
um-hum	2667	A
i do too	2667	A
uh-huh	2667	A
right yeah walking is kind of boring i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood and we try to	2667	A
we used to try to get together and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex	2667	A
and it's not as boring if you get several people and you can kind of talk and	2667	A
and it it makes it pass pretty quickly and the aerobics isn't too boring i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it	2667	A
um it's it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do i guess but uh i do i do have to make myself go and of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good and after i get finished i feel great	2667	A
i mean i can go in there i can be like a Friday afternoon when i'm tired it's the end of the week and i just want to go home and i'll make myself go and i'll have headache and everything and i get out i don't have a headache any more i feel great and i'm just	2667	A
it's amazing how much better i feel and then just in general i sleep a lot better and i just feel much better i mean i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks and i know if i would just get around to exercising	2667	A
i'd feel- feel better but my {dragginess} is my excuse for not exercising well i'm too tired or i have a headache or well i just got over the flu and i'm still kind of draggy so i better not go	2667	A
yeah it really is	2667	A
right	2667	A
right	2667	A
it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the	2667	A
but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday Thursday now that i can just kill two nights and and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in so	2667	A
no it's less expensive this one was only forty five dollars but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more probably	2667	A
since it's more expensive i think okay you spent that much money you'd better go	2667	A
so hopefully	2667	A
yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course	2667	A
uh-huh	2667	A
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms and it's it's a pretty nice setup um and of course it's real convenient because_1 it is right there at work i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it	2667	A
and just the fact that i can just go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot	2667	A
oh yeah	2667	A
quite a few do they have probably ooh i'd say fifteen different fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running and they have them anywhere from six in the morning uh they have some during	2667	A
they have them you know in the in the evenings they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that so they have big variety they even have some uh	2667	A
aerobic uh water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool i've never done that one before but	2667	A
uh-huh	2667	A
they've got an olympic pool and and basketball courts and sand volleyball they've got the full weight room and	2667	A
uh the locker rooms with uh a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and all the you know everything you'd need just about	2667	A
it's a real it is a real nice facility it's also got a full inside inside basketball court and i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things but it's it is very nice	2667	A
i just don't take as much advantage of it as i should i mean i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing but	2667	A
yeah well you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities and it's about eight dollars a month	2667	A
no not at all pretty cheap	2667	A
so and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership but	2667	A
i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what i've heard	2667	A
hm	2667	A
oh yeah in fact uh the T TIer's families can can come in on these things	2667	A
okay uh the question was about uh physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise well uh i i don't do it as much as i should i try to walk	2667	B
and uh last year i would i did it every day but i've kind of in ninety one i've kind of gone down hill	2667	B
and so i'm not doing it as much as i need to but i i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier	2667	B
but it's just to get motivated to do it and once i get started and and i i i can i do it every night it's just to get uh motivated- motivated again and	2667	B
what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again and um	2667	B
i was walking and it got kind of dark and i was by myself and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block	2667	B
and so i i kind of got frightened and i kind of use that as an excuse All i have to do is start earlier but i haven't walked since so	2667	B
it sure is it sure is it sure is how about you do you exercise on a regular basis	2667	B
uh-huh	2667	B
oh	2667	B
right	2667	B
uh-huh	2667	B
yeah it's once you get out of that habit you just don't you don't get back into it because i teach school and	2667	B
last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class we went in together and hired a private instructor and she came to our school twice a week	2667	B
and i i was i would go faithfully and then i missed once then i went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again i think if you you just have to stick with it	2667	B
uh-huh	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
sure yeah that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing like it's misery loves company i don't really love exercise i mean some i the neighbor across the street she goes belongs to President's and	2667	B
uh it's not President's any more i don't know what the name of it is anymore but uh she loves it i mean she it's just it's an automatic high for her she just enjoys it so much and i don't	2667	B
i'm i feel good after i do it but i hate it when i'm doing it you know i just i don't enjoy it at all and she just loves it so	2667	B
it even when she doesn't go to the health club she runs you know and it's a daily thing for her so it you know and it's so hard for me i envy her i wish i could be that way but i don't	2667	B
i don't and i have an older sister that loves running too and she runs all the time	2667	B
but at to me it's every minute's agony and i in fact i don't run i hate to run like when i walk i'll take along a radio or something and that helps you know pass the time	2667	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2667	B
that's right	2667	B
yeah yeah	2667	B
oh it's great afterwards yeah	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
yeah that's right	2667	B
exactly it does it gives you energy	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it yeah i find too that i have more energy when i exercise and i and uh you know it's silly not to but i don't know	2667	B
it's just a put off i don't know why i don't do more and i and i know that it's good for my health i know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health	2667	B
so you know you not only you know you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life so there's no reason that we shouldn't do it but i don't know	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
that's	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
right	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
does it cost the same for just two nights or	2667	B
well that's good too	2667	B
sure yeah yeah	2667	B
that's right that's right well do you have a facility right at the where you work	2667	B
no	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
and then they hire private instructors they have oh that's great	2667	B
yeah	2667	B
uh-huh yeah i can see that would be uh easy they make it as easy as they possibly can for you	2667	B
well um do a lot of people take advantage of it	2667	B
oh yeah	2667	B
uh-huh	2667	B
oh you have a pool there too oh how nice	2667	B
wow	2667	B
that's great	2667	B
now to use	2667	B
well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight room or to uh to take to go swimming do you have to pay for that too	2667	B
oh that's not bad huh-uh	2667	B
um	2667	B
i think so too yeah yeah	2667	B
well and and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics	2667	B
people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics	2667	B
most of it is TV	2626	A
yes i do we get a daily and then i get uh the Wall Street Journal also	2626	A
it's the uh Charlotte Observer	2626	A
um-hum	2626	A
yes right	2626	A
and the Wall Street Journal gives financial news and other information i'm interested in	2626	A
yes but it's usually after the fact uh as far as the major topics because most of the other has been on TV don't you agree	2626	A
yeah	2626	A
oh i think uh during the Middle East Crisis there was a problem in terms of too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out and i think that's probably a a good relevant	2626	A
uh fear of all of it yeah i didn't see a movie a long time ago but it was about the news team that um	2626	A
tried to influence the world and i i have a feeling that they're much more into themselves sometimes than they are into what the world um is ready to hear they create news	2626	A
yeah yeah i think so too	2626	A
and radio is sort of a catch up in fact i was um listening to the radio the other day and that they were reporting on the condition of an of an accident victim	2626	A
and i had already seen on the news about an hour before that that accident victim had died but the radio news report was that he was still in intensive care so it's one of those um	2626	A
it the most immediate is TV The others are catch up and fill in	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
how do you feel the the newspapers there in Colorado Springs uh treats local interest news	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
uh i think about other topics too i i'd like to go to a city and sort of look at the front page and find out what is going on in that city but it's always the national information that you have to flip through to find out	2626	A
anything special about the city and i think that's uh	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
no the older you get the more you know though	2626	A
oh right right yeah that's true what type of work are you in	2626	A
okay uh that uh is a news worthy company in itself so you're you would be interested in any news related to it yeah	2626	A
oh i'm i'm consulting right now i'm in between jobs so it makes uh it makes a difference i'm i'm interested in many more industries than i used to be just in terms of looking around so it	2626	A
i've been in the oil and gas business and then higher education and um done a few other things including international uh accounting so	2626	A
oh okay uh uh	2626	A
yeah yeah i understand that i was in Oklahoma so i i know the area very well	2626	A
yeah	2626	A
oh yes they'll they'll tell you a lot that's important but the trouble is the value do you watch Sixty Minutes and some of those other	2626	A
i	2626	A
i wonder sometimes where they get those topics you know the some of the topics are very very good and others are like uh who who who dreamed this subject up you know	2626	A
and as far as affecting a national audience i wonder sometimes	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
yeah	2626	A
no	2626	A
but i do enjoy we are here temporarily i enjoyed having CNN so that i could tune in the news any time i wanted to and not wait for network broadcasting	2626	A
okay it's it's a good addition because i think they're	2626	A
they have a lot of news obviously all the time and there's not the pressure then	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
yeah	2626	A
the	2626	A
oh i think it it too is under pressure	2626	A
uh-huh oh yes it was there are games played	2626	A
psychological warfare is a big factor all the way around um	2626	A
it's been it's been a big factor for many many years but this is the first uh first time we have seen it so quickly and so close up	2626	A
it	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
Denver paper okay	2626	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2626	A
yeah i think all the truth is is the big issue they obviously had to be telling a lot of truth because they were there reporting firsthand but in terms of	2626	A
yeah yeah	2626	A
did you just switch back and forth between programs	2626	A
uh-huh	2626	A
uh i think they they withhold when it's advantageous both sides both sides and i think when uh Norman announced afterwards on the Barbara Walters Show	2626	A
yes that um he knew you know what to expect out of Saddam- Saddam Hussein	2626	A
that he was playing games you know and and they both were i think that's all part of warfare is to play games	2626	A
yeah	2626	A
yeah	2626	A
yeah well let's hope we don't have to go through that again	2626	A
oh that would be nice i hope we never never get to but i'm afraid um human nature is such that somewhere there'll be a fanatic that will start something	2626	A
oh yes oh yes	2626	A
so how do you keep up with the news	2626	B
um do you read the newspaper	2626	B
um what daily	2626	B
Charlotte Observer um	2626	B
is that there in your city	2626	B
uh-huh so uh	2626	B
so uh	2626	B
do you think you get anything from your local newspaper	2626	B
um yeah i don't i'm not exactly sure how good the national news is though how accurate exactly	2626	B
fear	2626	B
yeah it seems like they're not really trying to report the news they are trying to report how the news affects them	2626	B
or where they're at with the news or something along those lines	2626	B
uh	2626	B
yeah a little bit of color or something for	2626	B
the lack of total information that was given on the TV lack they give immediate for the lack of total	2626	B
well	2626	B
rather biasedly i think- i believe huh very pro city	2626	B
uh for the city fathers but uh	2626	B
it seems almost as though they don't	2626	B
care about how the national news affects the local area	2626	B
yeah and then they give give you just the local O bits and that's it	2626	B
and	2626	B
and well hell you don't know know those people that died or or what from	2626	B
well what i mean is do you if your in a strange city you certainly don't know them	2626	B
i work for Texas Instruments	2626	B
uh yes and yourself	2626	B
yeah i understand	2626	B
huh that's interesting i've always considered myself uh	2626	B
how is this best put	2626	B
the the Charles Bollfield trash	2626	B
grew up in West Texas thank you	2626	B
yeah yeah	2626	B
uh	2626	B
so do you think our local uh do you think our national news tells us anything important	2626	B
um yeah i i i watch Sixty Minutes	2626	B
almost religiously	2626	B
well and	2626	B
and more importantly than that i wonder how	2626	B
the other side of the story is	2626	B
and of course they're not going to tell the other side of the story and they're not going to tell it accurately	2626	B
uh we don't we don't have cable	2626	B
yeah we've watched little bits here and there during the Gulf Crisis and we	2626	B
i didn't exactly- i wasn't exactly sure how accurate it was either	2626	B
and it seemed as though during the Gulf Crisis it might have been under pressure from	2626	B
the incorrect side	2626	B
i i'm not sure how to phrase that	2626	B
uh delicately	2626	B
yeah it is	2626	B
i i didn't feel comfy you know i you know you always hear about the warm fuzzy feeling	2626	B
i kept watching that	2626	B
be it CNN in a bar or or or or local news at home or federal news at home or or see uh	2626	B
we don't subscribe to our Colorado Springs paper we subscribe to the Denver paper	2626	B
and uh but on occasion more than occasionally we'll buy the local paper	2626	B
and	2626	B
that warm fuzzy that we're talking about i never could get that warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach about	2626	B
are these people really telling me the truth or more importantly all the truth	2626	B
well i'd suspect that to be true but you couldn't prove it to me	2626	B
and and	2626	B
most importantly i	2626	B
couldn't believe any of those people	2626	B
they didn't	2626	B
seem believable	2626	B
oh all four um well we have the independent here and we've got the three majors and PBS and we watched	2626	B
all four of those and on more than occasionally i went to a bar that had CNN running around the clock	2626	B
and	2626	B
still i got this feeling as though	2626	B
from these six or eight news sources i had that something was missing	2626	B
and	2626	B
oh Storming Norman	2626	B
oh of course and you've got to expect that	2626	B
but i had the feeling	2626	B
that no matter who i listened to it wasn't that they weren't telling me the truth i felt that someone was lying to me	2626	B
and	2626	B
there's nothing there still at this state that i can put my finger on and say oh here's where they lied to me	2626	B
just a feeling	2626	B
yes wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no more wars	2626	B
and more importantly	2626	B
wouldn't it be nice in this land of the free and home of the brave	2626	B
if there were never again be any misinformation	2626	B
okay the recording started what kind of habits- hobbies do you have	2665	A
oh well i'm interested in wine i like the wine	2665	A
yeah- yeah what kind of wines do you like	2665	A
oh really	2665	A
my goodness red wines huh i'm a white wine drinker myself i i'm on the white Zinfandels now i i've come up the ladder the Chablis and the Rhines now i'm got uh on uh Zinfandels	2665	A
really	2665	A
uh-huh	2665	A
uh-huh	2665	A
you don't have any vineyards up there do you Meryl	2665	A
are there	2665	A
oh okay now see i'm from Grapevine that's uh used to be we have a winery here but uh it used to be uh	2665	A
i think they had a couple of wineries at one time but they do grow grapes here that's where they get the name Grapevine	2665	A
oh are you	2665	A
uh-huh i understand- i understand the University of Texas has a huge winery down in south Texas some place really big one	2665	A
but i don't know they're	2665	A
i guess they're bottling it i don't what they sell it under- what name they sell it under have you ever visited the wineries in California	2665	A
i uh i've uh gone to a couple- my parents live in northern California so i visit there but back to hobbies i guess uh	2665	A
and what- what kind of painting do you do	2665	A
uh-huh	2665	A
oh okay that's a good idea i used to paint uh you know i just dabble and i really think i have a talent for it but i've never really	2665	A
explored it like i should what little i have done i think is pretty good but as i said i never have gone on with it maybe i should have	2665	A
if i'd uh you know taken a lessons or something but i in through the years i've just i'm not any good any more when i was younger i i used to be pretty good	2665	A
oh did you	2665	A
uh-huh	2665	A
yes i would imagine i would hope so anyway well i when i was in high school i think i drew a mural behind the concession stand at the local theatre and you know stuff like that	2665	A
i won first prize painting the front of a bar Halloween night- instead of kids soaping windows they wanted us to paint you know windows in town and i painted something won first prize on that but like i said i never did go on with it and uh	2665	A
wine we have wine cellars- that's nice let me	2665	A
oh did you	2665	A
oh uh-huh well you know we don't have not many people have basements here for some reason i don't know why the the ground's	2665	A
not wet like it is in Florida so i don't why they don't have basements you don't see too many of them_1	2665	A
yeah i guess so guess so well i only hobbies i have is i jog and uh every night	2665	A
and	2665	A
that's just that and my yard work i love to i work in the yard i i have my yard work done but i do my flowers you know and stuff i i like to do stuff like that and i have quite a variety of flowers	2665	A
i work on that every all the time	2665	A
oh yeah they really are beautiful gorgeous time of the year because_1 uh they're really out and especially roses roses do grow good down here	2665	A
i guess that's probably my best hobby and then i do volunteer work at a hospital that's kind of a hobby i guess i work in intensive care at a local hospital	2665	A
just um one night a week	2665	A
and that's kind of fun and different and kind of like a hobby i guess	2665	A
yeah i've i'm amazed the people uh the different types of people i've met that the rude people the people that are so inconsiderate of other people and i it just boggles my mind how many i find like that that	2665	A
think they're the only ones that are grieving or having a hard time they don't have any respect for the people you know sitting across the room you know and they'll be laughing and carrying on and here are these people that are	2665	A
sad and i just i just can't get over people- how people are i'm really getting- getting a rude awakening to how the human nature is i guess	2665	A
you know and last- last night i just there's big signs telling them_1 not to go in without checking with the uh	2665	A
volunteer and you must be twelve years of age to go in and no more than two people at a time and so this man walks in-	2665	A
golly you know he didn't even follow any of the rules and i	2665	A
and didn't even seem to bother of course they kicked him right out	2665	A
but	2665	A
can't i just can't believe people i it this is the that's some place you need to work to really see how people really are when it comes right down to it anyway	2665	A
oh uh-huh	2665	A
yeah	2665	A
i know- used to know a guy that uh from TI that was uh real big in standards uh James Tu that worked at uh TI and he was	2665	A
uh over the standards labs and everything i believe there	2665	A
and i was always impressed by all the clocks and you know the when we take things to be calibrated and what have you in the standards lab and it was kind of interesting	2665	A
that what you all do calibrate and	2665	A
huh	2665	A
um-hum	2665	A
uh-huh	2665	A
no i had worked for TI for seventeen years but i uh	2665	A
quit about five years- six years ago i guess and went with Mark Marietta and then came up here with another company and uh about two and a half years ago from Florida	2665	A
they're just back in the same area but i enjoy it here i'm a Texas person i'm not a native Texan but i love Texas so	2665	A
i wasn't happy till i got back	2665	A
never came back huh oh well my- all my family's in California i just i don't know i just couldn't stand being away from Texas i kept coming back	2665	A
and it feels good i i'm real happy here i like the weather and the people and i like the people in Florida too they were nice uh i enjoyed Florida but i like Texas better i guess but	2665	A
anyway i guess our five minutes is up	2665	A
it's been nice talking to you bye	2665	A
okay	2665	B
i have two main hobbies one of them_1 is painting and the other one is collecting wine but from your from the description it sounds like they're more interested in painting	2665	B
oh that's good that's fine i	2665	B
well i'm a very big favor- uh much in favor of red wines and i have about a thousand bottles down in my cellar and i've been collecting it now for oh fifteen years or so	2665	B
oh okay see- white Zinfandels are not a big favorite of mine though	2665	B
the whites i like are these very {oaky} Chardonnays like Kessler- Kessler and things like that	2665	B
uh there are some but and in fact their white wines are better than their red wines because they don't get enough sun to make good red wine	2665	B
i'm originally from El Paso Texas and i have friend who has a vineyard actually it's in New Mexico near La Yunon New Mexico which is just north of El Paso up the valley	2665	B
yes some of them_1	2665	B
oh mostly mostly figures i've few done landscapes my grandmother was an artist so when i was a little kid	2665	B
i was baby sat in her studio so i learned to mix paint by watching people mix paint things like that so	2665	B
oh for for years i used to go to groups that hire a model and draw once a week when i lived in New Jersey and used to work at Bell Labs and	2665	B
i'd go twice a week for three hours and you do that for about ten years you get to where you can actually draw pretty well	2665	B
oh i still paint occasionally not as much as i used to but i still paint i have some stuff set up the only two things in my basement are my painting stuff and the wine cellar which is	2665	B
well i built it i you- you have to way- have some way of storing them_1 so	2665	B
it	2665	B
yeah i think you probably don't get very good	2665	B
very good number of square feet for your dollar building a basement there that's probably why	2665	B
so you must have a lot well you ought to be seeing lots of flowers this time of year	2665	B
you find out what it's like in that kind of business	2665	B
and he probably didn't like that	2665	B
well working in a research place where i work at National Institute of Standards and Technology which used to be National Bureau of Standards that's kind of an ivory tower place so	2665	B
yeah i	2665	B
yeah there's lots of stuff the only people i guess i know at TI are either the people who work in the speech program who run this this computer program or if the people in the semiconductor area i used to know Pallab Chatterjee and those kind of people i don't know don't know if you'd know him or not	2665	B
well i grew up in Texas and i moved away and never came back so	2665	B
i guess they are it's been nice talking to you	2665	B
bye	2665	B
okay	2635	A
well i think the idea of public uh health services is a good one i think that we all	2635	A
um perhaps have a civic duty but i don't know as though it should be uh and i don't know if this uh was my interpretation was that perhaps it should be uh like a forced thing	2635	A
um i think it should all be voluntary as it is now but um i do agree that i think it is a good thing because i don't know how else a lot of these um things could happen if they didn't have the volunteers to do it	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
uh-huh	2635	A
well that's true and of course there was the need there and they didn't have any other resource and and uh i guess it it served it's purpose	2635	A
right is that what it was meant to do but as you say they were paid and i'm not all that familiar with the Peace Corps although i have friends who have family members that are in it and um	2635	A
um they generally go abroad and and uh serve but they don't get a salary and they give up uh X number of years of their lives to do this	2635	A
um	2635	A
i know some people that just came back from South America and uh they they are degreed and once they got their degrees they're a married couple and they went off they got uh some- they got some compensation but it wasn't a whole lot	2635	A
yeah more like a sabbatical i would imagine and uh i guess a lot of it was a learning experience for them i- i imagine it takes just different kinds of people	2635	A
and now they're uh back in school so maybe they're people in the beginning that just want to	2635	A
be in a constant learning environment i- i don't know	2635	A
but uh	2635	A
yes i- i agree i so much- so many of our things are going outside the country to benefit other nations and okay that's fine but what about here	2635	A
you know	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
i'll be	2635	A
you know maybe we've um got a turn around here maybe in the beginning we thought it wasn't such a good idea but perhaps if we instrumented it here in the US	2635	A
rather than taking all that manpower out of the US and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could come up with some of those things	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
right	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
that's uh that's a good thought now see i hadn't thought about it that way my first uh thought was when they mentioned that was to people who go abroad and do service abroad	2635	A
and perhaps there might be as you say more of an effort here needed	2635	A
yes that's true	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
yes	2635	A
i agree it doesn't always work that way the way it was intended and then the people change in this country too and not and are not able to see it through our administration changes also	2635	A
so	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
i- i think i'm inclined	2635	A
but it's been interesting it's been an interesting soapbox	2635	A
so	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
now i thought that was just a sign of the times we're all stressed out that's what they're trying to tell us that that we now get upset because we have to wait in line or wait in traffic but in in reality there's so much more traffic and so many more lines and	2635	A
really like you say something needs to be done about that too	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
apparently uh if we could get like we were discussing some people involved in this country like they want to be involved in other countries maybe we could do some some real good here	2635	A
you know and not take so long to do it	2635	A
i think it could happen	2635	A
that's very true	2635	A
or put these people that are in prison	2635	A
you know	2635	A
that's very true	2635	A
yes exactly	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
and supposedly we're uh reeducating them and putting them back out in the public so give them some public service	2635	A
i don't know i- i suppose to somebody's way of thinking we are but um i know that when they do get out the majority of them_1 aren't able to find jobs are they or get back into society because they have that {stigmatism}	2635	A
um-hum	2635	A
that's very true if you had uh uh a public health organization in the US that took and say a lot of the	2635	A
here we go	2635	B
okay Janet could you tell me what your thoughts are	2635	B
yeah they uh	2635	B
um the example they gave was like the Peace Corps	2635	B
uh	2635	B
i'm not so sure if i- i agree with that	2635	B
see uh	2635	B
back in Roosevelt's administration they had the CCC camps	2635	B
and i don't know about down in your area but	2635	B
like up here they built bridges and they built uh uh waterways leading from reservoirs to reservoirs to get to the city	2635	B
in fact in my area it's it's kind of a rural area and it's and the waterways are still in place you know they're uh they're beautiful they're all stone walled	2635	B
and	2635	B
it it just leads from the reservoirs way up in the hills and it just leads down into other reservoirs some of the bridges are still standing too i mean some of them need repair now	2635	B
but because of	2635	B
the recession back then or the depression whatever you want to call it	2635	B
uh there was a lot of people out of work so the government brought them in i mean they they performed a a public service	2635	B
but yet they were paid for it too	2635	B
right	2635	B
right	2635	B
yeah but they must get some compensation somewhere	2635	B
uh was- was it like a sabbatical	2635	B
yeah	2635	B
uh yeah like yeah	2635	B
yeah i think i think we need it in this country	2635	B
right we're uh	2635	B
you know we're supposedly on the leading edge of technology which uh that can be disputed i guess by a number of other countries	2635	B
um i do now that our rapid transit system uh is in terrible shape i mean most areas of the country we don't have anything	2635	B
where overseas uh they do their rail lines their their uh	2635	B
their subways are in much better condition than ours	2635	B
if we put	2635	B
if we put a force to work in this country building	2635	B
a network of rapid transit systems you know just from say outlying districts of downtown especially California where the i saw a program on uh PBS last night they're saying the average	2635	B
the average speed on the California freeways now in southern California is thirty six miles an hour and it's roughly	2635	B
uh a two hour wait to get from the outskirts of downtown	2635	B
and they figure by five years the average speed is going to be eleven miles an hour	2635	B
that's that's atrocious	2635	B
we have we have a lot of people that are in college and we have a lot of people that for one reason or another that that can't get into college either they can't afford it or or perhaps they don't have the abilities	2635	B
that's all more manpower and and one of the ways where we're we were coping with that was they were going into the military and they were getting a semblance of an education	2635	B
now the military's laying off	2635	B
uh i think there should be mandatory that people that are not in school should at least get into some kind of a career program i mean they can help build the United States back up	2635	B
yeah	2635	B
and we've done	2635	B
we've sent	2635	B
people abroad and the people that do go abroad are are usually	2635	B
um	2635	B
college educated	2635	B
they're taking the knowledge that we have and bringing it with them which is which is fine because	2635	B
in the long run if we educate those people and we build up their economy they're going to want to buy products that we make	2635	B
so- but i don't know if that if that is really taken place like the Philippines with the the massive corruption in there i mean a few people got it and the rest of didn't	2635	B
the Middle East same thing a few people got it and and the rest of them don't so in theory if you build up their economies and help these people yes it can work	2635	B
but the corruption at the top i think limits that	2635	B
yeah	2635	B
yeah i'm kind of uh a dreamer i guess i still- i still believe in	2635	B
we could put this country back to work we could bring the steel mills back in we could we could build our own rails we could we could create all kinds of jobs	2635	B
if we just had the incentive like	2635	B
um	2635	B
i'm not sure who started the national	2635	B
highway system you know the the freeways	2635	B
i don't know if it was if it was if it was Johnson or Kennedy or sometime before them the way they decided that yes we're going to have uh i guess we've got some of the best roads in the world	2635	B
we could do that too i mean we could we could get a national program	2635	B
Kennedy had a national program to land uh a man on the moon	2635	B
and we did it	2635	B
so- i- i think if we if we put our minds to it we can do just about anything we want yeah sounds like i'm on a soapbox	2635	B
yeah there's i just- i just remember how it used to be and it seems like that	2635	B
everything's just deteriorating you know you- you can't go anywhere without waiting in line you can't um	2635	B
yeah it just seems to be a waste of time	2635	B
i mean it takes it takes longer and longer to get back and forth to work	2635	B
we're adding to the pollution in the in the world whether that's creating the greenhouse effect or not whether it is or not uh it's still being debated	2635	B
yeah	2635	B
it could the the main thing is um	2635	B
like you said earlier in the conversation	2635	B
if we make it a mandate and say you have to do it then we're going to create all kinds of problems	2635	B
but i don't see why we can't say that i don't see why we can't you know you contribute well	2635	B
you don't go to school well spend two years doing something	2635	B
we have a welfare system that	2635	B
is defeating itself because they get more money from welfare than they can working at	2635	B
ordinary jobs	2635	B
so what's the incentive for them to go to work	2635	B
the prison population right that's there's i don't know how many millions of people now are incarcerated	2635	B
which is uh which is a huge drain on society	2635	B
what do you do with those people	2635	B
yeah but are we really doing that educating i- i suppose some	2635	B
no	2635	B
that's right and as much as you say yes you know i've paid my debt to society and all that it's still there	2635	B
and they're going to be apprehensive and if you had to choose between one or the other	2635	B
you know you wouldn't- you just wouldn't look at those people	2635	B
okay	2694	A
well what have you had done recently to your automobile that you're just really excited about	2694	A
um-hum	2694	A
oh that's major major isn't it	2694	A
is that all	2694	A
oh yeah well now this certainly isn't something that you could do yourself is it or would want too	2694	A
um-hum	2694	A
yeah i'm not about the only thing i can do mechanically with a a car is put gas in it	2694	A
i know how to take care of it but i wouldn't attempt to do anything although i did used to try and change the oil	2694	A
um-hum	2694	A
um-hum	2694	A
um-hum	2694	A
oh that's more interesting would- i would think	2694	A
i had the uh brakes changed on my car and what went in what i went in for i thought was rather a routine um not real expensive but you know maybe expensive but it turned out to be a four hundred dollar brake job	2694	A
and they they work okay but the noise is so loud there's such a whirring noise and they tell me that that should have gone away in two hundred miles but i	2694	A
really	2694	A
well i've still got it after about seven hundred and i'm taking it back in next week	2694	A
but	2694	A
well i didn't know see that's part of the problem you if you're not aware and um	2694	A
i agree um	2694	A
i- i guess you know the money has to be spent and that car has to be taken care of but you would hope that uh people would be a little bit more honest with you	2694	A
i guess maybe the key there is to get more than one estimate but i- i get so tired- tired of having to run here and run there you know	2694	A
um-hum	2694	A
that's very true	2694	A
well i guess we've kind of covered the topic huh	2694	A
current- yeah i'm afraid so more than they want to hear	2694	A
so well i hope you have good luck getting yours fixed	2694	A
uh-huh	2694	A
okay	2694	A
thank you very much and the same to you bye-bye um-hum	2694	A
so	2694	B
really depressed is a better word i actually it's being done as right now as we speak	2694	B
i had uh	2694	B
i guess that's something i could kick myself about i uh and i guess this all started with a	2694	B
leaky water uh pump and uh	2694	B
let the engine get overheated and uh right now they're pulling the heads off my engine and uh having to do uh replace the head and the exhaust manifold and so forth it's uh	2694	B
oh about five hundred dollars worth so far i guess around	2694	B
in there	2694	B
um well it some people could probably do it themselves uh i'm not one of those	2694	B
yeah	2694	B
well actually i did start i did some things myself when i before i found out what the problem was or how serious it was i tried a few things like changing the spark plugs and	2694	B
pulling the PCV valve out	2694	B
checking uh some of the things that might have been wrong	2694	B
i do you know some minor stuff but i don't really like to do uh car work all that much	2694	B
i'd rather do woodworking	2694	B
yeah yeah	2694	B
wow	2694	B
yeah	2694	B
you should of you should of never been there to begin with i don't know i would suspect	2694	B
um	2694	B
especially for four hundred bucks	2694	B
and you just uh you know you just never know and you know you feel like you're getting taken of advantage of a lot of times	2694	B
yeah that's not easy to do too because uh you know a lot of them_1 will pull it apart and start on it and then they want to then they add things on to it or whatever you can't always get an estimate i guess	2694	B
car repair we could go on for days huh	2694	B
yeah	2694	B
yeah i'll uh i uh i hope so too i've got uh	2694	B
my fingers crossed i was expecting that i might hear something this afternoon but not so far and uh	2694	B
but we shall see have a nice weekend	2694	B
okay good talking with you bye	2694	B
okay now uh the town i live in uh they started a recycling program	2649	A
uh in the certain small part of town a little couple neighborhoods- neighborhoods	2649	A
and they said that they were disappointed in the response that people they tried to promote it and everything but i don't think the city necessarily supported what the they were doing uh	2649	A
yeah i don't think they really uh encouraged it i don't think they really uh made it well-known how to do it uh that's my perception	2649	A
but	2649	A
yeah there used to be uh a big uh trash bin several trash bins in front of the Wal-Mart in town here that uh you could put plastic jugs on one side and newspapers on another and glass on the third	2649	A
but uh	2649	A
that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people really brought stuff to it all the time and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about	2649	A
and it's not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of town and who's going to do that very few people	2649	A
is that right	2649	A
yeah how how how do they monitor that though i wonder	2649	A
hum	2649	A
yeah	2649	A
yeah it would definitely help you know even if they were to uh uh pay like for recycling aluminum or	2649	A
uh newspapers or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery stores you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and and	2649	A
and get your money back or at least exchange it for another bottle that's full you know	2649	A
um i haven't seen that done for a long time either	2649	A
yeah everything's no deposit no return or else it's all plastic jugs that you just pitch you know uh	2649	A
yeah	2649	A
is that right	2649	A
hum	2649	A
hum	2649	A
i wasn't aware of that i thought they were more or less all the same	2649	A
there needs to be legislation that they should all be the same plastic	2649	A
yeah	2649	A
or at least have you know a a bunch of collection bins around the city you know if they had one	2649	A
for every five thousand people	2649	A
or or two thousand people	2649	A
uh you know just scattered throughout the city you know who who wouldn't mind just you know why going down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your car and	2649	A
and take them down and throw it in there i mean i think that would be great i i'd support that entirely because_1	2649	A
you know as a country we produce way too much garbage it's it's it's phenomenal	2649	A
oh yeah	2649	A
where i work there they have uh uh recycled paper	2649	A
thing so you just you have two trash cans in your office one one is for the regular	2649	A
non recyclable trash and is for paper yeah and you know i think it's great i use it all the time	2649	A
you know and i read that the companies now save like what fifteen thousand trees or whatever because of that and i thought that's great	2649	A
you know	2649	A
yeah	2649	A
is that right	2649	A
yeah	2649	A
yeah	2649	A
i've always wondered why they haven't taken some of these recycled plastics and made them into like uh plastic boards to build a house with instead of making it out of wood lumber make it out of out of plastic boards	2649	A
is that right	2649	A
once again the bottom line counts	2649	A
yeah	2649	A
yeah that that's a problem	2649	A
and then right it off	2649	A
that's right	2649	A
well	2649	A
that's about all i have to say tonight	2649	A
what's that	2649	A
yeah so did i but i thought i'd try one more time and sure enough it's okay	2649	A
well thanks for talking and	2649	A
see you later bye	2649	A
is this like roadside collection	2649	B
well now down here we've got you know collection bins in the parks and things but there's no	2649	B
you know there's absolutely no	2649	B
that's right	2649	B
well i've seen you know i've seen examples of uh communities where they	2649	B
they take the other other approach you know you you have to do it or you're fined	2649	B
and you know i'm actually all for that i don't i'm probably not the best-	2649	B
best person for recycling but i'll be damned if you know if they they didn't uh	2649	B
charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection every month i'd be sure and recycle	2649	B
i mean it's not that much trouble	2649	B
it's just different different communities that pass the laws that say you have to have to recycle	2649	B
you have to you have to you know on Mondays they pick up glass and on Tuesdays it's	2649	B
you know plastics or whatever and if if you don't uh	2649	B
if your garbage is just out there in a bag and it's not sorted you know they mark you down and	2649	B
fine you for it shit- it's kind of like	2649	B
it's the same principal when there's a drought they fine you for using water you know they just	2649	B
you don't do what they say and you	2649	B
not that i promote over government or anything but you know the the world's in a bad enough state that	2649	B
you know i	2649	B
people being the way they are you kind of need some incentive	2649	B
yeah	2649	B
right	2649	B
that's true	2649	B
yeah no deposit no return	2649	B
i was listening to Karen DeNard the other night	2649	B
on the way home from school you know she's got that talk show and uh	2649	B
KRA	2649	B
and they were talking about you know a lot of the plastic bottles	2649	B
you can't just throw all plastics together	2649	B
and they were talking about you know you need legislation to uh identify what kind of plastic it this is so you know you know you know	2649	B
what can be recycled as what	2649	B
because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave there's no they don't even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is	2649	B
you just can't throw that in with your	2649	B
two liter Coke bottles or whatever	2649	B
yeah so did i that's that's it was news to me too i thought it was kind of interesting though	2649	B
yeah they yeah that or you know things need might be identified and there needs to be a means a convenient means for people to to recycle i know for me now i've got to drive	2649	B
a few miles down the road to do it if i want to do it and a lot of times it's the difference between doing it or not doing it	2649	B
you know is	2649	B
whether you can like take it out the back like stick it out in the back	2649	B
back alley for the guys to pick up when they do or	2649	B
having to throw it in the back of your car	2649	B
right right	2649	B
yeah way too much well i know just as an individual you know i know how many times i haul out a bag of trash and it's like incredible if you multiply that times everybody	2649	B
you know on my block in this city it's crazy	2649	B
right	2649	B
yeah you're TI right	2649	B
yeah so am i	2649	B
yeah it is	2649	B
i guess there's the other side of the issue that uh there need to be facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods	2649	B
and that was something they brought up on the show i listened to was uh	2649	B
you know there's all kinds of you know recycled paper but you know nobody's wanting to use it	2649	B
you know how many people are using how many people do you know that use recycled paper in the office	2649	B
you know you can you can buy your your Moore's computer forms for your computer paper or whatever you can buy it with regular paper or recycled and	2649	B
i'll guarantee you in my building i haven't seen recycled paper yet	2649	B
so at the same time we're we're doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and	2649	B
and paying the extra dime on on a dollar for that recycled stuff	2649	B
well i think they actually do some of that but again it's the cost the cost of processing that it just	2649	B
it intimidates people you know it's easier to buy something that's	2649	B
you know the the the cost of building is already	2649	B
yeah	2649	B
for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people	2649	B
to do you know if you were building a house and you were going to spend you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on materials because your	2649	B
you're going to you're going to pay for uh technology that's not mature yet	2649	B
what are you going to do you know you're going to spend twenty thousand and	2649	B
and	2649	B
yeah you mean you're going to do what you can	2649	B
but uh	2649	B
i was surprised i thought this thing was shut down but i	2649	B
i thought this whole switchboard thing was shut down i was surprised to get the call	2649	B
yeah	2649	B
great	2649	B
all right all right bye	2649	B
i uh i have not like i was saying i um haven't- i have not had to make the decision for uh	2688	A
regarding uh care for anyone of my family members however i've had quite a few friends that have had to make that decision	2688	A
oh really	2688	A
man yeah	2688	A
huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
it's a	2688	A
uh-huh yeah i think there's there's so many that are uh that are you know retirement homes	2688	A
that are geared towards the ambulatory person- you know the ambulatory person that is still	2688	A
extremely active and just wishes not to have to live alone you know	2688	A
separate any longer and then there are the uh the nursing homes which actually provide you know nursing care i guess it goes there's a wide range	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
that's right	2688	A
that's true that's that's what i would be afraid of i would rather personally i would rather be in a community of other people with	2688	A
a greater chance of having similar interest with them	2688	A
rather than being stuck in a home where i mean if you if you couldn't drive i guess i mean if you're no longer have the the freedom of driving	2688	A
then it it changes it so drastically because you can't go someplace to do something when you want to you have- you are totally dependent on someone else to provide all your entertainment for you and that would	2688	A
i don't think i would like that i think i would rather	2688	A
if i were in that situation i think i would rather live in a in a nursing home situation	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
no	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
yeah that's true	2688	A
that's true	2688	A
that's true and and the the nurses that they hire are	2688	A
frequently not um the most qualified in their field	2688	A
and uh	2688	A
um-hum	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
yeah	2688	A
right	2688	A
right i think	2688	A
yeah	2688	A
uh-huh my great grandmother was and she was she was terrified that some day someone might try to put her in a nursing home she even wrote a song about it she used to sing but	2688	A
i mean she she died when she was ninety six and uh	2688	A
she uh you know and she was still	2688	A
she was still household independent she was independent in the household you know in the home and she couldn't drive but heck but she'd never learned to drive to begin with so i mean it wasn't um	2688	A
her age that had prevented her but she was she was very afraid that someone would try to put her in a nursing home and she lived with her daughter my grandmother until she died and uh my grandmother still at seventy	2688	A
uh she's seventy nine this year uh is living independently	2688	A
i think that for so many people that uh the nursing home represent obviously different uh different things and depending on the level of function	2688	A
whereas my you know my grandmother doesn't need- need any extra uh camaraderie or anything like that because she gets it from her church or from her friends that come by but uh	2688	A
i've seen a lot of people that don't live near their family or don't have you know significant roots in this in their little community they've been uprooted for some reason or another	2688	A
and they i i think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that	2688	A
would offer them uh oh activities to maintain an active mind	2688	A
because like you say if you just put them in the house and keep them there all day long and they they become they vegetate and that's	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
uh-huh	2688	A
and that's not living right- right exactly	2688	A
exactly	2688	A
yeah they	2688	A
yeah	2688	A
oh no i mean look at the uh Orientals they protect respect uh they conserve their elderly	2688	A
for for what they are they're a true natural resource and they cherish them and uh yet i mean we as Americans are such a throw away society	2688	A
that we've basically done that with generations of people that have so called outlived their usefulness	2688	A
you know i- i think that's uh an atrocity and i'm fortunate enough that i've had uh my relatives have lived very long full lives and uh	2688	A
or most of them have and as a result i have uh i've been you know	2688	A
well see i don't have a relative that's made it over sixty one	2688	B
uh-huh	2688	B
but my children's on their father's side have them up into the nineties	2688	B
but uh	2688	B
the only time we came close and we started looking into it was when my grandmother became senile she start senile at fifty	2688	B
and at that time the homes that we were looking for when i was a kid uh my mother i can remember them_1 arguing they couldn't find one that it was either clean enough or they took enough care or	2688	B
there was one thing or another that continuously arguing about it	2688	B
and they ended up keeping her from relative to relative and of course she died when she was fifty nine so it wasn't that long	2688	B
the few i've been in they have varied tremendous	2688	B
so uh	2688	B
oh well we were talking about it the other day because a girl at work has got that problem right now	2688	B
and uh she keeps saying she's never going to put her mother in one and i says hey look go around look at them they're totally different than your concept- concept of what it was years ago	2688	B
and i says i don't know what condition your mother's in which i didn't	2688	B
but you do have the choice now and i says what is your mother going to do all day long while you're out here at work	2688	B
i says think about what she would like to have because a lot of them hey they might be bedridden but at least they've got company and people their own age to talk to	2688	B
to keep them_1 home what do you've got	2688	B
they're sitting there like they're they vegetate	2688	B
is what happens	2688	B
uh-huh	2688	B
see you're not aware of the the horror stories and things like that that i've grown up with	2688	B
and i mean i'm talking about horror stories and they're still out there i mean it's it's not something that's eliminated- eliminated- been eliminated	2688	B
there are lots of homes out there that just literally people drop them off forget about them and they change hands i mean i'm not saying they don't investigate they investigate it's great when they're there but unless they keep current with it	2688	B
and they changes hands it goes either direction	2688	B
because	2688	B
they're relying on a lot of people that hey they're like any other business if you lose a lot of your customers they get into a financial bind	2688	B
and people say well you know they're a nursing home but the hey it doesn't work that way they're a business	2688	B
well like my neighbor she runs down here to this nursing home down here	2688	B
and she just point blank's tired the pressure and responsibility of working as a nurse in a hospital	2688	B
she admits it she's tired of it so she works down here she's a nurse she's qualified	2688	B
but she's fifty oh she's in her fifties- early fifties somewhere and working down here at the nursing home keeps her hand in there she gets good money for it and she enjoys the old people	2688	B
you know it's it's just that simple for her	2688	B
but uh she says it's hard they get cranky they get obstinate	2688	B
but she feels the same way i do i would rather depending on the situation i would rather be able to put myself or anybody else in a nursing home if i was able to get close enough to them	2688	B
so they don't feel lost	2688	B
now see my grandmother she wouldn't go in a nursing home besides being scared and everybody else didn't want her she was terrified of one literally and positively terrified	2688	B
because she remembers the old stuff	2688	B
uh-huh	2688	B
uh-huh	2688	B
oh she drives yeah	2688	B
oh yeah they've got nothing or they get on the telephone all day long	2688	B
but i mean this is one area where i'd like to see social security or the government step in and take people over a certain age or with handicaps or something and take their social security away from them	2688	B
i mean give them_1 you know money at a certain point and putting them_1 in homes to where they can get something fed back to them in other words people talk to and become still human beings	2688	B
because you see people down in south Dallas and every where else sitting in a house they don't know anybody they're scared to death of robbers they're scared to death of everything	2688	B
they hardly have enough food to even eat on	2688	B
i meant they're not living	2688	B
yeah i mean hey i'm putting all this money out to the government why can't they put it out there rather than in the federal prisons um	2688	B
but you know you see pictures on TV i mean i wish i had enough money to go down there and do something but	2688	B
you know i don't know they can- if they can have day care why can't they put elderly people care and put them in a home to where it's regulated	2688	B
i mean it's it's a shame that we have this to where it's we don't think of our older people we really don't	2688	B
there we go	2671	A
yeah um	2671	A
i like um a lot of different things so um i'm into got a big record collection and uh uh mostly- mostly rock but i got some folk and some jazz	2671	A
yeah okay that's uh	2671	A
that- that covers a pretty wide range right there	2671	A
yeah	2671	A
hum well yeah i mean you can get CD's of the Sex Pistols which um i think kind of defeats i mean somebody's missing the point	2671	A
well i have um	2671	A
i know- i don't know what the exact count is but i know it's like eight hundred to nine hundred	2671	A
albums and um	2671	A
yeah i i got a CD player about four or five years ago and i've been buying CD's but um you know i'm not trying to	2671	A
i'm not trying to go LP to CD because_1 well for a couple of reasons one is i can't afford it and um the other is some of the stuff that um i've got a and i'll never find on CD it'll never be reissued	2671	A
and- and and there's a bunch of stuff that i really really don't care if i have it on CD	2671	A
oh you're you're a big Bowie fan or	2671	A
yeah i was just kind of well styles change and you get it's like oh Dave Bowie's not weird anymore i'll get uh	2671	A
he married a model i didn't know that	2671	A
hum i haven't been	2671	A
i been uh i got to pay attention hum	2671	A
no man you know just got the new issue of Rolling Stone and they didn't mention it so	2671	A
it seems so odd to me that David Bowie is showing up in People magazine it's just like wait a minute i mean you know it's like oh	2671	A
i mean i'm not i'm not a huge Bowie fan but i like his music actually the the coolest Bowie thing that one- one- one- one of the coolest things i have happens to be a Bowie item it's a um	2671	A
um	2671	A
it's a picture disk with uh of him and Bing Crosby doing Peace on Earth uh Little Drummer Boy and you know you can get this as a forty five but this is like a twelve inch with um the um the label is	2671	A
instead of being a real label is a picture of him and Bing from the uh from the Christmas special that it was from	2671	A
it's it's a trip um	2671	A
um but it's it's always the thing that's like oh you know you know when i got people over and we're trying to you know you know uh you know weirding people out on music that one usually gets them_1	2671	A
hum	2671	A
um-hum	2671	A
yeah uh	2671	A
um-hum well i know the feeling when i've gone um and just knocked myself out um i'm a big Who fan	2671	A
and i've gone and knocked myself out sometimes finding old Who forty fives with like these B sides that never got put on an album you know and i was knocking myself- you know i found these a bunch of them_1 you know didn't spend a whole lot of money on them_1 um	2671	A
yeah i've yeah it was a big thing well i got i have a friend who's like the forty five king of the world he has	2671	A
something along the lines of fifteen thousand forty fives he has every top forty single	2671	A
since he was born nineteen you know like nineteen sixty four and i think every top twenty single going back to around fifty five i think he's cut it out lately because_1 most- most of the stuff	2671	A
you know he can only get as cassette single and he you know we both despise cassette singles um but he's found some of the Who stuff for me and you know we went you know all all this trouble to find this and then	2671	A
they released a couple Who rarity albums that had like half the stuff on it it's like great	2671	A
you know and then the one other i think the one other Who thing he located for me was um	2671	A
uh i don't know if you're familiar with the Who they they have a song called Substitute	2671	A
doesn't ring a bell	2671	A
oh okay	2671	A
okay anyway um there was a	2671	A
um a single of Substitute out and	2671	A
okay now you know what i'm talking about yeah um anyway it came out in the mid sixties in in this country on a weird record- on a record label that they aren't normally on so it was cool they find it for that but the B side was something called Waltz for a Pig which	2671	A
wasn't on any record and it wasn't on the rarity records so this was a big deal and then um you know once once Steve found it for me and everything i i happened to go and- and look back at some like Who biographies i have and uh i discovered that	2671	A
the B side isn't actually by the Who it's by what's called the Who Orchestra because there was some like legal thing that said the Who couldn't record and so it was actually by the by a band called the Grand Bond Organization	2671	A
so it's like gee all this trouble and it's not even the Who oh well it's a fun thing to have anyway	2671	A
but it turns out that um	2671	A
uh you know listening to the the version of Substitute on the single it's actually different than	2671	A
than um the one that was normally in the US because um	2671	A
uh there was some lyrics they found objectionable i think the one uh i look all white but my dad was black	2671	A
um the American record companies said nah you know you can't release this so they it has a different lyric on it so that's kind of neat	2671	A
but	2671	A
yeah	2671	A
well yeah um you know i have um you know like you were saying you know i've got i have a lot a lot of bootlegs and stuff by the Who and uh by Pete Townsend and uh some of the really fun stuff with Townsend is um	2671	A
one- one of the demos i have is called Obscure and Oblique and it's it's a bunch of demos	2671	A
and i you know i'm really curious actually how they got their hands on this stuff but um it's really cool listening to the stuff because_1 um you hear things that are different than the way the Who actually recorded the song or or he recorded the song solo	2671	A
and it's just kind of interesting to see his um you know	2671	A
yeah there's um he's also put out a couple albums called Scoop Scoop and Another Scoop which um are collections of demos so i have like three collections of demos of his and there's a couple songs in the collections that are	2671	A
the same- almost the same as songs the Who did on their last album but aren't	2671	A
so that's that's really cool i mean there's this one song called Popular that became the song It's Hard with um a different verse	2671	A
so	2671	A
yeah	2671	A
well	2671	A
yeah	2671	A
um-hum	2671	A
oh but you got a good one though	2671	A
yeah i'm like that a lot with the Who i've got	2671	A
i i counted it up sometime and i have like twelve versions of Pinball Wizard by you know either by the Who or it's a demo or it's a live version by the Who and then there's like the Elton John version and then um	2671	A
i guess the the the weirdest ones i have are ones by the New Seekers you know the guys that did I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing and uh the other one is uh Rod Stewart of all people Rod-	2671	A
um-hum	2671	A
i don't know it's it's hard for me to listen- listen to it in true light anymore since i've heard it so many times um i mean i can't- i mean i want to throw up usually when i hear it anymore i um	2671	A
well the the problem with the problem with Pinball Wizard is that	2671	A
it's you you hear it on the radio and it's completely out of context with	2671	A
because it it it's part of a larger work	2671	A
and um so i don't know i mean i don't- i don't want to disagree with you i i	2671	A
okay music	2671	B
yeah so do i	2671	B
i have everything from Frank Sinatra to the Sex Pistols	2671	B
so	2671	B
it's a pretty weird thing i was pretty bummed when they had CD's come out though	2671	B
right	2671	B
well i've got four hundred and fifty records and it's like oh	2671	B
wow	2671	B
right	2671	B
yeah no	2671	B
right right i've got a pretty good David Bowie collection	2671	B
uh yeah used to be i mean i i still like him a lot but he's	2671	B
right- oh he he	2671	B
yeah he's marrying that model and i don't know that- Iman the black model she's about twenty two years old	2671	B
i think they're supposed to get married i know he's been everywhere with her	2671	B
staying up with People magazine you haven't been staying up with People magazine	2671	B
uh every so often he's on the society-	2671	B
society page as it were with a picture of her	2671	B
it yeah it's wrong	2671	B
right right yeah	2671	B
how funny	2671	B
oh that's great	2671	B
one up yeah	2671	B
um i got i've got like bootlegs of his concerts and stuff which i kind of treasure and	2671	B
his old records and stuff and i remember when i was in high school you- combing record stores anytime i could get the chance uh for something of his and now it all seems for not you know you can get his old stuff on CD	2671	B
that's	2671	B
uh-huh	2671	B
oh	2671	B
right but uh finding them_1 was the the effort	2671	B
wow	2671	B
oh	2671	B
it sounds familiar but i can't no i like the Who i've got some Who	2671	B
-Substitute yeah Substitute yeah i know that song yeah okay yeah	2671	B
yeah something	2671	B
how funny yeah it's	2671	B
um-hum	2671	B
cool yeah	2671	B
how he works up to the final product	2671	B
oh yeah	2671	B
how fun oh that's great oh you do- fifteen thousand singles oh i can't- i have like uh	2671	B
twenty five and i think i'm doing real well but a lot of those are real precious to me you know like Vanilla- Cherry Vanilla you know the which was a i i have all of these like uh	2671	B
the Bowie genealogy you know if if if i read somewhere in you know Circus magazine in nineteen seventy two that David Bowie knew so and so well i had this get- you know i bought a Mot the Hoople album i didn't even know who Mot the Hoople was	2671	B
but i knew that David Bowie produced it right so if David Bowie wrote a song and somebody did it i ran- bought- i bought the album you know	2671	B
wow	2671	B
right	2671	B
yeah you know	2671	B
you know i was listening to that song the other day now you- you-	2671	B
you would know this you of all people would know this i was like i have listened to that song a million times okay and we had just gone to church and then we were like listening to it and i went	2671	B
uh do you see like those- those overtones i mean couldn't that be like a gospel song you're going to go listen to it and go this girl's really weird but i mean it's like	2671	B
i	2671	B
but i was listening to it and it was like you know the guy was like blind i don't i can't even uh think of what now and i kept saying no no you know listen it it works	2671	B
right	2671	B
i i don't know how many	2671	B
yeah	2617	A
right	2617	A
right	2617	A
yeah	2617	A
i i agree with that i was i was fairly young at the time too i i really don't have very many memories about it at all	2617	A
in fact and uh my husband is a Vietnam veteran and i- you know he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on he	2617	A
i- it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one	2617	A
right	2617	A
that's right i mean they weren't there by choice and and	2617	A
right	2617	A
right	2617	A
no i don't think you can and i i agree with you that i i think that the the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in in in every aspect of it	2617	A
and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war i mean they're still not settled over there	2617	A
and i have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way	2617	A
i think we're going to end up back there in a few years or if if not sooner	2617	A
i think it would too	2617	A
no	2617	A
yeah i agree with that	2617	A
uh-huh	2617	A
yeah yeah	2617	A
well you have to i- you know you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he he said that's what we were going there to do and he did what what he said and he did pull out before it got any further than that where where it would have turned into more of a police action	2617	A
uh or more of a political action i guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as as another country	2617	A
i mean that-	2617	A
my my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address	2617	A
that's right and and that's- that's what frustrates me more than anything	2617	A
right	2617	A
i think there's a lot of waste and and they don't i- if they could just cut out all the fat and and get it lean	2617	A
and start addressing some of the other issues i think we could take care of everything and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world you know who just end up using things against us later on anyway	2617	A
uh-huh	2617	A
right	2617	A
yeah	2617	A
yeah a lot of good has come from this one	2617	A
and i think i guess in in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war because like we we said earlier that you know the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of of that war and and	2617	A
right	2617	A
exactly	2617	A
uh-huh	2617	A
yeah no kidding	2617	A
and i just i just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid	2617	A
for you know uh nothing i mean it was they're they still don't know what they were there for	2617	A
no	2617	A
yeah that's true	2617	A
uh-huh	2617	A
right	2617	A
right	2617	A
right well- the when this war broke out it frustrated me all this- the antiwar people and	2617	A
you know their all the demonstrations that were going on i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity because those kind of people i mean	2617	A
you know they're the kind of people who are who've always got to have a cause whether it's good bad of indifferent they've got to have a cause and	2617	A
and i you know that nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're you're supporting the war you you have to support the people that are there	2617	A
and some for some reason those people don't see that that	2617	A
no no they don't and you know they're just real shallow people	2617	A
yeah	2617	A
yeah i mean they're not helping anybody that's the that's the whole point they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves	2617	A
and i don't even know what they're doing for themselves you know	2617	A
yeah	2617	A
yeah	2617	A
that's true yeah	2617	A
yeah	2617	A
no i guess not	2617	A
i know we get cut off all the time too	2617	A
yeah it is	2617	A
thanks same here	2617	A
bye-bye	2617	A
uh i have uh i guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War um	2617	B
i i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what was happening	2617	B
um looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now i i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about because i	2617	B
because we never went to war i don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out and i i feel like it went on and on	2617	B
and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening	2617	B
you know i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and i'm not sure that's our role	2617	B
but	2617	B
don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time i mean i do think that i- i- it's been too long in coming but i feel like maybe the American people and	2617	B
and and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that	2617	B
that those so many people were opposed to the war what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it and those guys were there doing their duty	2617	B
yeah and i i think that we learned from that and i think it it's one of those things that you learn the hard way it was a tragic mistake the way that they have been treated over the years and i believe that's just now	2617	B
turning around Just now you know trying to be rectified and i'm and i'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people	2617	B
no they're not	2617	B
yeah	2617	B
well i i appreciate the feel- i feel like President Bush is in a hard spot he went over there to get them out of Kuwait	2617	B
which he did	2617	B
and then he has backed out he has pulled out and i realize they're still saying well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein so why aren't you helping us and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation	2617	B
and i don't think the US will stand for it i don't think he would do that uh i think we learned too much	2617	B
of the effects uh you know whether it was justified or not i know	2617	B
that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause i i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and and beat the communism but	2617	B
but i think somewhere that got lost you know in the long term effects of the of the war and	2617	B
yeah	2617	B
yeah	2617	B
that we don't get fixed	2617	B
i know	2617	B
and i i believe that we have to have a military and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us	2617	B
but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward	2617	B
i know i do think that in the Middle East war um i think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with uh kind of a different attitude	2617	B
uh i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more	2617	B
and uh and i think that's good you know i think that's a good	2617	B
i think so too	2617	B
and perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam	2617	B
so i i i do think that	2617	B
we've learned from it	2617	B
you know i i i wish there weren't war	2617	B
but uh i do think we learned	2617	B
yes	2617	B
no there was no feeling of accomplishment no goal no	2617	B
we went in but what did we do we lost lives and and what were we trying to do who knows	2617	B
and i i think you're right uh	2617	B
i think you're right there	2617	B
um i do remember when it was over i remember when they were coming home	2617	B
uh	2617	B
but	2617	B
i remember the feeling back then you know like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war	2617	B
uh yeah there's a lot of people that aren't for war i'm not for war	2617	B
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right i don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam	2617	B
i just remember oh yeah our guys are over there and it's sad and we shouldn't be fighting a war but there was no let's support them you know	2617	B
yeah	2617	B
that's right	2617	B
that's right	2617	B
that's right	2617	B
they don't see it as supporting the folks the people	2617	B
i would agree with you there	2617	B
i i agree	2617	B
um and i and i recall when President Bush said that you know he said look he said i you know i'm sorry that you're opposed to the war there's a lot of us that are opposed to war but uh you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that	2617	B
but	2617	B
their not	2617	B
that's true	2617	B
uh	2617	B
giving a soapbox to stand on	2617	B
but well i just i i'm glad we've learned i'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam	2617	B
and uh and i'm i'm i'm especially sorry for the people that are you know have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally because	2617	B
you know until the last- past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that for them	2617	B
and and i think that's where we as American people really failed you know failed them	2617	B
so	2617	B
i don't know	2617	B
well	2617	B
do you have anything else you want to say on this	2617	B
i think this is the first time that i haven't been cut off by the computer	2617	B
usually i can talk all day but this is something to me that's sad	2617	B
so well have a good day and i appreciate the conversation	2617	B
bye-bye	2617	B
there you go	2675	B
well- well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend	2675	B
uh sentencing	2675	B
uh	2675	B
now my personal opinion uh i don't know uh uh here lately it seems	2675	B
well up until a few years ago i guess there there was- uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many	2675	B
oh they just broaden the the human rights in to to cover just about everybody- everybody and i don't think uh	2675	B
those guilty of committing capital crimes should be uh permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole it's just not right	2675	B
and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing	2675	B
uh yes very possibly so many of us have led- led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a a a jury i've never done it myself	2675	B
unfortunately i wish i could have	2675	B
i've just never been called up	2675	B
well now that's possible	2675	B
but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury	2675	B
not that i know of	2675	B
uh-huh	2675	B
uh i've never heard of it	2675	B
uh well there again uh	2675	B
i suppose it should be	2675	B
exactly- exactly	2675	B
is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times uh you get one or two holdouts and and it permits the criminals to get a retrial	2675	B
and now that- that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened	2675	B
and uh giving them another- another- another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence	2675	B
yes uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials	2675	B
hum	2675	B
um-hum	2675	B
oh that's it and you just might resemble somebody	2675	B
uh	2675	B
out here in Texas we had a a a a a	2675	B
great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally uh	2675	B
uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a 7-Eleven i think it was	2675	B
and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work and he had all sorts of of a uh character witnesses and whatnot	2675	B
they-	2675	B
they found him guilty	2675	B
well they said it was- that this happened during lunch time and he could have disappeared- uh gotten away at lunch time and uh committed the robbery	2675	B
but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a TV show about it after nine years they finally uh came up with evidence and proved- to prove that he was innocent	2675	B
exactly now that just was not fair	2675	B
so	2675	B
yes unfortunately that's what happens	2675	B
well it's not the uh uh it's- it's- it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world	2675	B
uh-huh	2675	B
and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they they trying to solve them_1 and everything and but uh oh i don't know i think the Supreme Court	2675	B
well i'm i'm i'm still rankled about their decision to permit burning of the flag	2675	B
well it the the uh the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action	2675	B
and uh uh oh that just rankles me no i swear if i ever saw somebody that	2675	B
uh burning- burning a flag i'd i'd try to kill them_1 i would	2675	B
well i happen to be a flag freak i served i was in the service i was in Korea	2675	B
and uh	2675	B
well i saw what the red in the flag represents	2675	B
um-hum	2675	B
yeah see what they	2675	B
see what- how they like it under another flag	2675	B
um-hum	2675	B
well Jean we seem to be of of uh uh	2675	B
the same uh uh opinions here i hope they get something out of this	2675	B
oh passing sentence well uh uh yes-	2675	B
yes but i i think the jury should be able to recommend	2675	B
yes	2675	B
oh yes yes	2675	B
uh i don't know if that's a regular procedure or what	2675	B
but uh i know i'm always hearing that uh well the jury came in with a guilty- guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something	2675	B
yes	2675	B
of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five	2675	B
um-hum	2675	B
yeah but too many times they they are permitted- permitted to go out on parole and	2675	B
yes they just go out and repeat their crimes	2675	B
well there well they say after- after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses	2675	B
um-hum	2675	B
uh yeah very true well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so- so frequently	2675	B
uh race or nationality even	2675	B
but uh like you said it's uh it's- it's- it's not the best system but it's the best one we've got	2675	B
um-hum	2675	B
sure enough	2675	B
Jean it's been awful nice talking to you	2675	B
well let's hope neither one of us ever have to run into this- this uh with subject we've been discussing take care now bye	2675	B
um-hum	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
i think i agree with that very much i do you	2675	A
i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves	2675	A
in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done	2675	A
um-hum um-hum	2675	A
i never have either	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
uh is there a reason why you have never	2675	A
uh-huh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that that was why i was never called uh-huh	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
uh-huh uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury	2675	A
somebody told me the other day that there is what- what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true	2675	A
i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision	2675	A
and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not	2675	A
that would mean they all would have to decide	2675	A
one way or the other	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
yeah yeah	2675	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2675	A
bring some of these things out um-hum	2675	A
uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many	2675	A
people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that	2675	A
uh but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the person- wrong person at the right time	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
ah um-hum	2675	A
um-hum um-hum	2675	A
they still found him guilty	2675	A
when people said he was at work	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
well	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
yeah	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
oh for heaven's sake so there's nine years of that man's life gone um-hum	2675	A
no huh-uh yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we try- bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial	2675	A
and yeah	2675	A
and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to	2675	A
because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world	2675	A
yeah it's the best one that exists i guess so	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
oh i think a lot of people are i think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
yeah yeah	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
that bad huh i wouldn't like it but i don't know if i'd go that far	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
yeah well i think pride in our country and our flag is is- so important it's important in so many facets of our life	2675	A
and uh i i- i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else exactly-	2675	A
there's nobody holding them here	2675	A
right they'd soon be back i'm sure	2675	A
yeah	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
yeah i don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury	2675	A
uh-huh	2675	A
make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do	2675	A
um um-hum	2675	A
and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen	2675	A
yeah	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole they're denied it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and	2675	A
and a lot of different things i guess	2675	A
um-hum a lot slip through the the protective whatever they have to do and and there are bad ones that do slip back out and	2675	A
end up hurting somebody again	2675	A
um-hum um-hum	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
um-hum i always thought there was it was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family	2675	A
got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right it doesn't make sense	2675	A
um-hum um-hum	2675	A
um-hum	2675	A
yeah	2675	A
so	2675	A
yeah right so let's put up with it i guess improve it if we can if we ever get a chance so	2675	A
so	2675	A
well it's been nice talking to you Jack and uh i hope you have a real good day and week	2675	A
i hope not you too bye-bye	2675	A
well me being from Texas	2634	B
i hope you're ready for this	2634	B
well i'm not your stereotypical Texan i was raised around guns hunting	2634	B
so i don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect i respect- i respect them and what their capabilities are	2634	B
and on top that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a Green Beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry	2634	B
and here in Houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country	2634	B
and here here here you go here you this will be border line NRA which i am not a member of	2634	B
i mean you i know you've heard this this slogan um if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns	2634	B
well you've- you've got well any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such	2634	B
they get out their little Mac ten's they get out there little Uzis and they're going to fight with them and it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm	2634	B
if they want it they'll get it	2634	B
i don't care if if they've got to go	2634	B
down in New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border	2634	B
now my position	2634	B
although i have absolutely no use for fully automatic weapon anyway	2634	B
since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony	2634	B
if i wanted to buy one i don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it they want to run a background check on me fine if they want to put a seven day waiting period fine again	2634	B
if they want to have- want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too	2634	B
well the only well the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has is this guy a convicted felon uh is he a habitual trouble maker are we picking him up every Saturday night for a drunk and disorderly and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems	2634	B
you know just proving that you're a basically a good citizen	2634	B
if if they want the firepower they can get it	2634	B
it doesn't- it doesn't matter how restrictive	2634	B
you're border control points are they'll get it across the border one way or the other	2634	B
uh	2634	B
okay now go back to that one to ten scale where one being total gun control ten being none i said about an eight	2634	B
i said the restrictions i would like to see on for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun i would like to see them go through either	2634	B
i'd like to see a law enforcement agency not NRA	2634	B
but whether it be the your state police or your county police	2634	B
for you to be able to purchase a handgun	2634	B
you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly	2634	B
handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics	2634	B
well the hands- in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as a weapon as a as a pistol	2634	B
well there's	2634	B
uh not necessarily a price thing what is	2634	B
happening at least in this state and i expect to see it in other states very soon legislation's been introduced as	2634	B
that if a citizen of the state being myself	2634	B
has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed- unconcealed	2634	B
okay you you're you're from California right LA area	2634	B
okay	2634	B
okay you've been to the city	2634	B
all these people coming around	2634	B
someone attempts to mug me i would just- i would	2634	B
as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because_1 i can meet him blade for blade	2634	B
now if this legislation comes through he pulls- i'm out with my family we've gone shopping we're fixing to get in the car this guy comes out pulls a blade on me i'm going to pull a gun on him now	2634	B
when you're looking- and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick	2634	B
then it's still equally matched	2634	B
having spent- having spent time in combat i feel i feel it before they'll get the gun on me	2634	B
if i'm draw at the same time	2634	B
i actually it's not- it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent- is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here but hey he	2634	B
carrying just as much firepower as i can and if there's if you got to go through a certification course to get to where to where you can carry it in public	2634	B
then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it	2634	B
now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not that's another trip but	2634	B
in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat	2634	B
even even more so when it comes to my my wife and son	2634	B
anybody tries- anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink	2634	B
this- this is where the question of gun control comes in what i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot	2634	B
say a person uh starts- uh uh get all of a sudden my combat antenna goes up and say i've got the vibes this guy's fixing to do something i go ahead and pull my piece	2634	B
and i make sure this persons sees it so he's got no doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then	2634	B
if he doesn't back up that point he deserves what he gets	2634	B
because_1 i have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family i'm going to dust you	2634	B
as it stands now i've got to do that with a blade	2634	B
and the only reason i feel confident- comfortable- comfortable doing that is because of the training i've had	2634	B
well if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss that's the kind of training i've had i mean it's	2634	B
well um i'm uh pretty pro gun control over all i am	2634	A
have had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and uh	2634	A
i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most of the people who argue gun control with me i find um	2634	A
use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the NRA slogan arguments and um	2634	A
uh so i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it	2634	A
um i guess on a one- a scale of one to ten i'm probably around a two	2634	A
in terms of fair restricting guns and i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very very little effort	2634	A
um and uh guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um i'll i'll give it a try i've got my Texan stereotypes in place	2634	A
uh-huh	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum it's pretty powerful isn't it	2634	A
okay okay	2634	A
um-hum that applies to anything as well as guns	2634	A
a gun	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum um-hum	2634	A
what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because_1 pretty soon it's it wouldn't	2634	A
you don't want to have someone making a personal choice in that way i would hope i mean because_1 that means someone the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff	2634	A
yeah	2634	A
but if you're not a very- if you're not a basically good citizen you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway	2634	A
so why have-	2634	A
so why have any restrictions at all	2634	A
uh-huh	2634	A
yeah	2634	A
um-hum um-hum	2634	A
well we could be	2634	A
well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but uh	2634	A
i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so	2634	A
well i'm still i'm still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if uh if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway	2634	A
what's the point of putting a restriction basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because_1 the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they're not going to take those courses is it uh is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns	2634	A
if it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices is that uh main advantage	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum uh no Bay area San Francisco Bay area	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
what if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon	2634	A
i	2634	A
yeah	2634	A
well i'm i'm sure i'm sure given given all your training i'm sure that	2634	A
you know you'd if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want to walk through with you because i'm sure you have good	2634	A
you know uh far- far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them_1 effectively and everything	2634	A
um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a felony- uh haven't hasn't yet committed a felony	2634	A
if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire	2634	A
it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
yeah don't it	2634	A
no i i understand that what if uh what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake	2634	A
yeah well uh that was the topic	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum	2634	A
um-hum um-hum	2634	A
well as as someone who would- would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because uh	2634	A
you're not going to get bullets flying around and killing people instantly and uh	2634	A
gosh i wouldn't know i've never worked for a large organization	2600	A
well i will take that back i i was in the Air Force for thirteen years i guess that qualifies as a large organization	2600	A
sort of large yeah just	2600	A
a little bit little bit bigger than TI	2600	A
okay oh some of the benefits i- see- i- i never really counted that as an organization because it's uh	2600	A
yeah the benefits are strange they change every day and uh	2600	A
you don't really have a lot of choice	2600	A
not like TI do you want this or do you want this or do you want this	2600	A
um	2600	A
oh i mean you certain	2600	A
oh really	2600	A
no i mean you have the choice of taking this health insurance or	2600	A
some other or something like that	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
of course i can't say we didn't have a choice if you always wanted to you could uh go out and buy your health insurance and	2600	A
yeah out of your own jeans and stay a way from the base hospital which is generally what i did	2600	A
kind of scary	2600	A
uh i i never fully trusted them the only time i ever went there was when i had to for a flight physical or something	2600	A
uh which has to be their doctor but they're not doing anything to me other than testing me so i let them do that	2600	A
well i don't	2600	A
yeah i don't i don't	2600	A
i don't bad mouth the military too much i had a i had a good time	2600	A
well from benefit well that's one of the reasons i made a decision to get out	2600	A
uh i what i perceived as the benefits were just eroding	2600	A
uh	2600	A
yeah you know that that part is good except for the except for the little thing that you're paying into social security for twenty years and when you start	2600	A
that's right and then and then you start drawing your retirement pay and if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for dollar	2600	A
and i always thought that that that was a big rip off	2600	A
uh	2600	A
but still- but still	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
don't worry they're recording every word	2600	A
oh okay you're you're right you're right	2600	A
that's right	2600	A
that's right draw your own inference	2600	A
um	2600	A
but but but what you are saying about the military times is is true i mean fifty percent uh of your base pay is pretty good	2600	A
yeah that you know that sounds great on paper but it's not it i- uh it's not something that i would look would look forward to	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
no now	2600	A
uh-huh	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
yeah i mean don't get me wrong uh it's for something something that was major	2600	A
i i wouldn't have any problems with them it's the daily uh go in with the with the flu or something like that	2600	A
and and the the treatment is terrible i mean first you wait for hours and hours and hours and then the guy says you have a temperature you know well i knew that	2600	A
we're going to give you Sudafed you know i've been taking Sudafed for two weeks it doesn't do any good	2600	A
that's all i can do that's all i can do	2600	A
yeah um-hum	2600	A
yeah yeah well that that's HMO's are designed that way i mean they are going to they're gonna they're gonna get the most bang for their buck	2600	A
and uh you know they're they're in the big profit making business	2600	A
yeah absolutely	2600	A
that's it forever and ever	2600	A
all all you have to do is you don't have it let something bad happen	2600	A
and that hospital will slap a lien on you so fast	2600	A
because_1 they- because_1 they do it routinely	2600	A
yeah oh i know i know	2600	A
i know my roomie's got um the insurance through the school	2600	A
and it it runs fifty eight i think fifty eight bucks a month something like that	2600	A
an that's not bad but you don't get anything	2600	A
i mean to tell you	2600	A
that's exactly right i mean it's it's nothing	2600	A
um	2600	A
it doesn't cover doctors or anything else it's crazy	2600	A
no i mean you can go it will cover something major	2600	A
but forget about things like uh eyes or your teeth or anything else	2600	A
it it- what it is it's medical insurance on paper	2600	A
that's right read between the lines are you covered no	2600	A
but you know i mean the whole health care thing in the states is so screwed up that uh	2600	A
uh it's it's totally ridiculous	2600	A
it is i mean	2600	A
i'm one of those forty million Americans running around with no health insurance at the moment	2600	A
huh	2600	A
yeah	2600	A
well it's sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax uh they create	2600	A
money	2600	A
to tax you with or to tax you on	2600	A
there's a neat little formula on the back that you have to complete	2600	A
and assuming you're you're you're at poverty line where you're uh deduction or you take the standard deduction of thirty two fifty uh that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars	2600	A
tacked on to your taxable income	2600	A
yeah and of course it goes higher and higher the more money you make	2600	A
but the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is three hundred dollars and they create money out of thin air	2600	A
i wrote- i- i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying gee i didn't know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went	2600	A
uh-huh	2600	A
on the refund yeah uh Alabama did that too	2600	A
and i always thought well this is pretty nifty you taxed me when i made the money the feds	2600	A
yeah the feds took it out and now they're giving it back to me and now you're going to tax it again i seem- i seem to recall- recall something about revolutions and wars about double and triple taxation and stuff	2600	A
course uh course it it's the by word now i mean let let's tax everything three or four times	2600	A
yeah there should be	2600	A
no	2600	A
eleven	2600	A
no because because quite honestly the American people are so apathetic about everything Washington can do what they want to do	2600	A
yeah that too	2600	A
i'm a lifelong member of the NRA	2600	A
i'm not as militant as i was when i was younger but i still firmly believe in the rights to to own and bear arms	2600	A
yeah that's garbage	2600	A
they're they're wrong the militia in those days was the common man there was no organization of militia the militia made up the the everyday common man and	2600	A
that's right and and if they said hey we need a militia then all the able bodied men were were supposed to show up	2600	A
so what are the benefits working for a large organization	2600	B
uh	2600	B
that will make it interesting	2600	B
yeah i i would qualify the U S government as	2600	B
large if not too large	2600	B
yeah yeah	2600	B
the benefits are funny	2600	B
yeah	2600	B
well we don't have that kind of choice either	2600	B
oh	2600	B
yeah out here in the real world it's a lot it's all the same	2600	B
no matter who your employer is	2600	B
uh	2600	B
yeah	2600	B
here in the Springs we have a choice of two either an HMO or a company health insurance	2600	B
so there are two	2600	B
out of your own jeans yes	2600	B
ooh	2600	B
it was that bad huh	2600	B
well there are other benefits with the military	2600	B
that the civilians don't get	2600	B
well i just meant from a benefit standpoint	2600	B
yeah	2600	B
well the	2600	B
their pension plan is really good	2600	B
and then you can't draw it	2600	B
yes	2600	B
yeah well on the other side of the fence	2600	B
the way it works is that uh	2600	B
some employers	2600	B
although they have a qualified pension plan they don't have a	2600	B
viable pension plan	2600	B
and we won't mention any names	2600	B
i know	2600	B
i didn't say it was them	2600	B
but i didn't but	2600	B
but i didn't say it wasn't either	2600	B
we will let them draw their own conclusions	2600	B
uh	2600	B
and	2600	B
uh	2600	B
medical for the rest of your life	2600	B
well we have	2600	B
we have had some medical retire- i mean some military retirees work up here for us	2600	B
or a bunch really and	2600	B
they did use the heck out of the medical	2600	B
military medical	2600	B
now the military dental was poor	2600	B
at best	2600	B
but the medical seemed	2600	B
somewhat adequate	2600	B
yeah yeah	2600	B
yeah uh i'm a member of an HMO	2600	B
and uh from all indications it's quite similar to the military	2600	B
yeah exactly and	2600	B
and	2600	B
so	2600	B
the single benefits that i consider among the most important are medical insurance	2600	B
because without it you can be	2600	B
broke for the rest of your life	2600	B
yeah and	2600	B
yes and the funny thing is that uh	2600	B
private medical insurance is grossly expensive	2600	B
if you are not a member of a group	2600	B
uh-huh	2600	B
that's not bad	2600	B
well you get what you pay for don't you	2600	B
doesn't cover doctors	2600	B
are you covered yes are you covered really no	2600	B
so	2600	B
yes it	2600	B
it it's a shame it's	2600	B
in our state currently when in Colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax	2600	B
they ask you if you have medical insurance if you do	2600	B
you have to pay for those that don't have medical insurance	2600	B
i think it's two or four dollars a person i don't remember something along those lines but it	2600	B
still the idea irks me so that	2600	B
right	2600	B
oh no	2600	B
huh	2600	B
uh Colorado is a nifty thing if you	2600	B
or they did until last year	2600	B
in times past if you got a federal tax	2600	B
refund	2600	B
you paid state income tax on it the next year	2600	B
and now you're taxing me again on it	2600	B
yes	2600	B
yeah	2600	B
and there are tax revolutions going on currently	2600	B
but the problem is it's not an armed insurrection	2600	B
it's not a violent overthrow of the people in Washington	2600	B
and they are trying to take away our guns	2600	B
and those people that say that	2600	B
all that amendment to the Constitution was guaranteeing is that we will have a militia	2600	B
i think they are sorely mistaken	2600	B
he pulled his squirrel rifle off his wall as he walked out in the yard	2600	B
uh i guess i've had to return something but i'm can't- can't decide mostly it's been because i didn't like the color	2658	B
or um i'm not sure whether i've had to return that many things uh	2658	B
oh are you	2658	B
okay good so we'll talk about that some	2658	B
right	2658	B
okay i'm going to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like you're i let- let me tell you just a little bit about myself i	2658	B
for years i did all that shopping and what not but for the last four or five years i've had eye problem and i've had two cornea transplants	2658	B
shopping is no fun anymore i can't	2658	B
see good enough you know and uh it's hard to tell what i'm doing and it's just aggravating- oh i just thought of something we have to return all right it'll it'll come to us okay are you ready	2658	B
Laurie all right	2658	B
all right uh tell me about your computer Laurie i think that sounds fascinating	2658	B
uh-huh	2658	B
um-hum	2658	B
um-hum	2658	B
oh yes	2658	B
uh-huh	2658	B
oh lovely	2658	B
hm now now the computer was supposed to have two	2658	B
oh i see	2658	B
oh i see	2658	B
in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it they probably didn't know what they were talking about	2658	B
right	2658	B
huh	2658	B
uh-huh	2658	B
oh dear	2658	B
huh	2658	B
yeah it really is	2658	B
right and time- and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction i think that's the worst part uh i	2658	B
now that's an advantage isn't it it really is i think uh uh there's a lot not to be said for credit but that's one thing to be said for credit it how it gets you some muscle where you need it	2658	B
and i think that's really- really important	2658	B
yeah	2658	B
that's right that's right	2658	B
that's right no	2658	B
yeah they will	2658	B
that's right they will they will put the kind of clout on them_1 that you can't really do yeah we Hal bought me uh uh small uh well uh uh	2658	B
little jam box kind of thing so i'd my i have my ninety three year old mother living with us and so i uh she doesn't remember anything but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help and i thought well if i had uh a nice- a nice little uh	2658	B
tape recorder you know so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i can uh uh copy uh	2658	B
parts off i i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use someplace so i figured well this'll be good well the first uh uh the first time i turned it on	2658	B
uh i was recording and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the thing	2658	B
okay so after that then you couldn't get a you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side	2658	B
and then on the other side when i when i uh i loaned- loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to a to a videotaping they were doing and uh she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far and so you can't	2658	B
you- you can't get it to run the right the right way either so uh yeah so i i wish i could tell you i really don't know which brand it is uh	2658	B
yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know i have the papers and everything and we're going to get just take it back but uh	2658	B
yeah i think just uh just uh one of the major- major i think it was a you know i don't i think it was uh	2658	B
you know like a Highlands or something like this	2658	B
do they have Highlands up there	2658	B
don't they well this is it was a regular uh electronics store- store you know so i don't think i don't think there'll be too much problem but i i guess i'm not sure whether i think	2658	B
things are not made as well i think they deliberately sometimes	2658	B
um	2658	B
don't you what what for instance what are you	2658	B
yeah	2658	B
they just get they're getting a kind of a attitude of not	2658	B
yeah	2658	B
well cars-	2658	B
yeah yeah i think that's right the fact that	2658	B
right the fact that they that they have- have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes uh dwells on a fact that	2658	B
you know uh i've had i've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them_1 well they may cost a little more but they don't have to take them_1 to the shop every other day	2658	B
yeah	2658	B
yeah it does the they do a good job so part of it is that we need to develop more of a of a pride in	2658	B
in uh the kinds of things we do so we make them_1 better	2658	B
and it kind of has to start from the top and- and go clear- or from the bottom maybe and go clear up people	2658	B
no no	2658	B
yeah	2658	B
attitude is is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and on what i'm doing right i think that's too bad and it's a shame too because um	2658	B
when you get right down to it most things there isn't any if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough there isn't any way to get paid enough	2658	B
but if- if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction so whatever you're paid is enough	2658	B
uh-huh	2658	B
that's right i think they underestimate how much how much value the satisfaction is	2658	B
no	2658	B
yeah yeah	2658	B
yeah it probably- it probably basically goes right back into the home- home though unfortunately starts with the one person that	2658	B
you know and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that	2658	B
there is value just in work for itself	2658	B
without any pay you know	2658	B
yeah the the the that the value is in doing it well and	2658	B
uh-huh	2658	A
well i'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned so for me it's actually a pretty good topic	2658	A
yeah well we could talk about that and then we could talk a bit about um just quality of products in general if you they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that	2658	A
uh	2658	A
i can imagine well actually i don't	2658	A
you can't read labels and you can't	2658	A
good	2658	A
there you go	2658	A
okay	2658	A
yeah	2658	A
right	2658	A
well we bought a computer because_1 my husband needed to use it to do some	2658	A
work for a consulting project and we called up the company and asked them details on it we bought it sort of your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper	2658	A
and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with and they were very happy with the system and they felt they've gotten a good price and we went in we explained what we needed and yes we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey to get	2658	A
to meet these people	2658	A
and so we went there we told them about the stuff and the guy said	2658	A
uh that the computer would fit our needs and we these things won't make any sense to you probably but he told us there were we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer	2658	A
and it's called a user boards or slots is what it's called	2658	A
and he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit sorry two sixteen- sixteen- four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user and we can put full size cards in there and so we said great you know we'll buy it and we put in our order	2658	A
and a week later we went back and picked up the computer and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it and there's only one slot we could put it in	2658	A
and at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because_1 we really need to be able to put at least three in	2658	A
and	2658	A
well it has them but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it in it	2658	A
and even though they told us in advance that you could they told us there'd be no problem because_1 you know the salesman just doesn't really know	2658	A
right that's completely it the salesman didn't know so we went back in and we struck an agreement with the people they'd change	2658	A
the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards	2658	A
okay so they did that and we said are you sure that this will work we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway and etcetera and they're and they were doing it at their own costs and so we said fine	2658	A
and we went back and we talked to the technical person a second time and things like that and then we come	2658	A
we get the computer home my husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldn't go get it sooner because_1 i just had the baby and you know life's just a little bit complicated and uh he goes and gets it brings it home first of all they're missing	2658	A
components of it like cables so you can't really test it out and then second thing we still can't put the boards in because they have other things blocking where we need to do it	2658	A
and see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again and they say they can you know do something different and change some connectors and we hope so but it's a hassle you know- you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing	2658	A
what goes on	2658	A
right	2658	A
so well actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation and they said well you don't have to pay for it yet	2658	A
yes- yes	2658	A
yeah	2658	A
right and so you know	2658	A
well because_1 these guys if they um give us a hard time we're going to say you look you know if you- if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're just returning the computer	2658	A
and if we do that i just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge even though they've already paid it but they'll just you know undo the credit that they did to them	2658	A
yeah	2658	A
right	2658	A
and	2658	A
um-hum	2658	A
uh-huh	2658	A
oh no	2658	A
um-hum	2658	A
um-hum	2658	A
what brand is it do you know	2658	A
but i was wondering like you know in our case we we knew we were buying a copy we weren't buying an IBM PC and i was wondering if you	2658	A
uh-huh did you buy it at some major store	2658	A
uh-huh	2658	A
i think a lot of things are not made as well	2658	A
um oh well-	2658	A
gosh it's hard to think of an exact example but i think that um	2658	A
i just- yeah i just have uh well i like electronic stuff you know for one thing i know their work you know cars i think are not made as well as they could be	2658	A
um because i they want people to replace it after a couple of years	2658	A
um-hum	2658	A
yeah i had a Toyota and i loved it my Toyota did really well	2658	A
good	2658	A
yeah	2658	A
well i i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship the people just don't care about what they're doing you know the whole nobody cares nobody's- nobody's really paying	2658	A
right give me my paycheck so i can go home	2658	A
yeah	2658	A
yeah and also i think well i do research and so i'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever- whatever work	2658	A
gets done but	2658	A
and you get satisfaction out of it and	2658	A
but i think a lot of it you know i think things come both from the	2658	A
uh individual side and also from the company side because the companies that let	2658	A
give the attitude that well you know you're the last one hired so you'll be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and we don't really care about you as an individual when you've got that type of attitude on the people don't care about their work and so	2658	A
little value just in whatever you do	2658	A
doing a good job of it	2658	A
okay i uh i have five children all together	2623	B
uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen and uh my youngest is twelve	2623	B
uh yeah if you like doing everything twice	2623	B
uh at any rate um	2623	B
my first two children uh	2623	B
i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them	2623	B
um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh full-time job that was more than a full-time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday	2623	B
and uh so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to	2623	B
yeah the yeah the family- well it was with all of them but it was uh more an impact i think on the oldest two	2623	B
because um	2623	B
oh about the time i got out of working	2623	B
that long hours was when the uh when the twins were about three years old and uh they never you know i don't think they	2623	B
noticed i wasn't around that much you know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around very much um	2623	B
so what i've tried to do uh now	2623	B
that i've uh finally- went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old and uh so	2623	B
then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty one hours a week so i've tried to spend more time with uh the children since then um what i'm currently doing is uh taking a lot of time um	2623	B
helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings um we just started a thing where every other week we go to uh movies there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights	2623	B
and so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the movies and	2623	B
it's working out pretty well um we're spending more time together i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before um	2623	B
and in fact i found that i'm a lot closer with uh i have one son who's gone and i don't even know where he's at um he's taken off for parts unknown but uh yeah and- and uh my	2623	B
daughter is um	2623	B
and uh so it's it's it's	2623	B
it's been difficult to try to find the time and i think it's important that we do because um i notice that uh when i had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a uh	2623	B
a me kind of attitude	2623	B
and i noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and	2623	B
you know it just you know i saw the family falling apart down there	2623	B
yeah and so i think it's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now and i'm doing my best to keep that up	2623	B
yeah what's your been your experience	2623	B
um she didn't up until the last oh six months	2623	B
uh	2623	B
she just recently started working uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient and uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week	2623	B
huh	2623	B
yeah	2623	B
uh-huh	2623	B
certainly do	2623	B
uh-huh	2623	B
yeah that sounds great i've i've noticed uh another thing um oh when i was younger my father was always working and	2623	B
yeah and uh you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and i never saw him so i didn't have much of a role model to go by	2623	B
you know to learn how to be a a father and a parent	2623	B
and that kind of thing because i i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or catch with my dad or doing anything with my dad	2623	B
yeah and it if you don't have i don't i it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough you know everybody's not Father Knows Best	2623	B
yeah but	2623	B
yeah	2623	B
yeah	2623	B
yeah i mean the the the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh the mental capacity to raise them and	2623	B
yes	2623	B
yes it's it's not easy i've uh you know i've helped out extremely	2623	B
uh well i can't say that but i've helped out as best i could at home and uh you- as you know with five children it takes a lot of work	2623	B
even if even if someone's home all the time there's still a lot of things that have to be done	2623	B
uh well now i work for Texas Instruments so so i'm in computers	2623	B
yeah and so i've uh prior to that i uh i worked in a food store	2623	B
and uh you know work-	2623	B
uh right	2623	B
yeah it uh it was uh it was a a smart move to make um i was more intelligent than the position i was holding	2623	B
and uh it was	2623	B
yes i i felt that it certainly was i mean i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for and uh you know every time something new came up i was explaining it to them and uh i had	2623	B
yeah i uh	2623	B
yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and that's why i you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with	2623	B
yeah	2623	B
yeah	2623	B
yeah well it it all paid off um so uh you know i got my degree and got the better paying job and	2623	B
and uh	2623	B
you know we i think as a family we're a lot better off	2623	B
uh-huh	2623	B
yeah well my goal is to try to retire by the time i'm fifty five	2623	B
great	2623	B
uh-huh	2623	B
well i'm	2623	B
okay	2623	A
i'll let you go ahead	2623	A
oh uh-huh	2623	A
oh	2623	A
that's great i always thought it'd be great to have twins	2623	A
well yeah	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
your first ones you mean it was this way	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
oh	2623	A
right	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
huh	2623	A
that's difficult yeah	2623	A
uh-huh it happens that way	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
um uh-huh	2623	A
Texas is much worst for the drugs i mean it was bad enough every place else but drugs is in Texas are extremely bad	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
well that's all you can do	2623	A
well i i was going to ask too does your wife work	2623	A
uh-huh she just recently started working then	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
huh	2623	A
oh uh-huh uh-huh	2623	A
so that sounds great well uh we also have five children	2623	A
and but ours are all out of the nest so uh as when they were growing up i probably we had a lot of similar things like- like you had	2623	A
you know having the time when you have younger ones to take care of	2623	A
you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones but uh we were we're very active of course at church and uh Boy Scouting and Girl Scouts Four H	2623	A
uh and those activities helped a lot in giving us things to do with the children	2623	A
and uh we try to take a vacation with them every year camping of some sort something that wasn't expensive	2623	A
and uh	2623	A
our youngest is uh expecting her first baby so they're they're all out and on their own they're a and we have one to get married yet and they'll all be married	2623	A
uh and they're they're all doing pretty good they uh two lives in Pittsburgh you probably don't know where that is	2623	A
okay two of our children live there uh one i like i said lives near Maryland- in in around Maryland DC he works right on the border of DC	2623	A
and one lives in Connecticut and our baby lives just a mile over the hill so we'll get to see her a little more than uh what we do the other ones	2623	A
uh-huh well they have to	2623	A
yeah	2623	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2623	A
to go to follow uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
yeah	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
and that does make a big difference	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh that's that's well none of us are let's face it you know we're not none of us like they portray- portray it on those shows i mean life's much more difficult than that	2623	A
and uh	2623	A
right right now our daughter our well she's our second oldest she has she's the only that other one that has children she has two boys and she works full time	2623	A
and i have mixed feelings about that she's able to do that and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home	2623	A
but yet on the other hand i i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time	2623	A
to those children when they are together and and so it seems it seems for them that it works out all right	2623	A
so i don't know i i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family i	2623	A
yeah	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
yes it does it it yeah	2623	A
yeah what line of work are you in now since you went to school and	2623	A
oh okay okay a lot of the people i've that's called- i've talked to work for uh	2623	A
for the same	2623	A
uh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
which your income would be a lot better now	2623	A
yeah	2623	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2623	A
right	2623	A
and it's kind of a waste of a person	2623	A
you know	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh uh-huh and you you recognized this and was able to you know do something about it	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
well it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family	2623	A
and the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can because it's very easy to uh become go your own direction when you're so- when you're working so hard and going to school too	2623	A
well that's wonderful	2623	A
uh-huh	2623	A
uh-huh it sounds to me like uh you're doing well my husband's retired so uh he's been retired for three years now yeah that's quite a change	2623	A
oh well he made it at fifty it was a magic number for him and and uh he went at fifty and he still works part time at other thing you know	2623	A
same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently but uh	2623	A
nevertheless retired	2623	A
okay so do you do a lot of cooking in your family	2627	B
um-hum	2627	B
oh yeah	2627	B
yeah	2627	B
do do you like to cook	2627	B
yeah yeah	2627	B
oh really	2627	B
oh	2627	B
yeah yeah but that's neat though because_1 you get to have different stuff yeah i'm not i'm a pretty bad cook i'm pretty bad my husband is really good he put himself through college working in restaurants	2627	B
and uh he's a much better cook than i am so when i was home i still cooked a lot and i was into a lot of vegetarian stuff	2627	B
yeah they say oh dad let dad cook mom let him do it but um	2627	B
so so do you all do you have kids you obviously have one okay you have two	2627	B
two and half oh	2627	B
i was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it or are you not at that stage yet	2627	B
yeah	2627	B
right	2627	B
oh yeah	2627	B
oh my gosh	2627	B
oh my gosh i couldn't yeah	2627	B
boy i couldn't do that i	2627	B
what's that	2627	B
oh really	2627	B
oh yeah what's what is that Saint Jack or something scallops saint something or yeah yeah yeah	2627	B
really	2627	B
with scallops	2627	B
no no i'm from New England so we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here	2627	B
was kind of like a game they had uh a murder mystery and you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner	2627	B
and it was really fun and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around	2627	B
trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game so	2627	B
so i was thinking there's this beef bourguignonne recipe that i've tried before that's pretty good and then you can make that ahead and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready	2627	B
so that's uh	2627	B
yeah	2627	B
uh yeah	2627	B
oh yeah	2627	B
i know my husband did too his parents are Austrian and they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table	2627	B
yeah yeah yeah	2627	B
oh my gosh	2627	B
yeah yeah	2627	B
oh gosh so do you	2627	B
oh they did the	2627	B
that you do right right that's just part of it	2627	B
yeah we didn't my family didn't but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly he never there was dishes that he really enjoyed	2627	B
so but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans i tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it so i never i had i was limited i had to make vegetarian meals without using soybeans but	2627	B
yeah yeah that's true	2627	B
yeah some of the stuff is good but it just it was a tremendous amount of cooking because_1 you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete	2627	B
and we had little kids at the time you know when i was home with them and it it was just so much cooking i couldn't i don't like to cook and i'm not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much of a too much too much cooking	2627	B
so well i guess i'll let you get back to feeding your little one there	2627	B
he's set oh okay okay	2627	B
do you like to bake at all or do you do you get into that's that's	2627	B
yeah	2627	B
really no kidding	2627	B
yeah then be gone i know that's the thing about baking i used to i- i don't mind baking at all and i- i can do a pretty good pie we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother and my mother taught me how to make it	2627	B
and um so i can make a pretty mean pie but	2627	B
um i don't do it anymore because_1 it's just too fattening we had the same kind of problem if you make homemade bread i mean forget- it's supposed to save you money but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat it tastes so good	2627	B
oh uh yeah	2627	B
yeah i	2627	B
yeah uh-huh i've heard of that i've heard of it but i've never done it	2627	B
that sounds pretty good	2627	B
yeah oh yeah	2627	B
yeah and then you save- you make the bread but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something	2627	B
yeah yeah yeah	2627	B
yeah that's true that's that's got to got to kill anything i guess but	2627	B
all right well yeah thanks Plano yeah Plano in Texas are you in Texas	2627	B
no kidding gosh it sounds so close	2627	B
yeah i thought for sure	2627	B
yeah i thought for sure you were in Dallas or something	2627	B
yeah	2627	B
yeah	2627	B
yes yeah they're do they're trying to get all different amount of people well jeez my husband is from Richmond and i went to UVA that's where we met yeah yeah	2627	B
oh you did yeah	2627	B
yeah boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast i'll tell you	2627	B
it's nice over there	2627	B
oh really	2627	B
oh yeah no kidding well its things are doing pretty good down here we we were we tried to move over to Raleigh last year and there just was there was so little	2627	B
such little going on in Raleigh you know you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there so we decided we'll try in a couple of years but but business is	2627	B
you probably could okay well it's good talking to you	2627	B
take care	2627	B
bye	2627	B
um i do some every now and then i- i work and my wife's home during the day so she usually ends up doing most of it	2627	A
when i was single we used to always cook around the house	2627	A
huh yeah i really like it um there's a few dishes like i- i grew up with the um you know having Polish and Ukrainian food	2627	A
and my wife she likes Italian and stuff so we we definitely have different tastes so	2627	A
uh-huh	2627	A
oh wow	2627	A
they're like uh preferring it now right	2627	A
yeah two um-hum	2627	A
yeah one is uh nine months and the other is two and a half	2627	A
yeah that's the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh	2627	A
yeah it does	2627	A
we try our hardest to to get them_1 to eat what we eat you know	2627	A
and my sister uh she's the master of the fast order grill you know she can make uh she makes six different meals but we like to have one thing you know one likes chicken nuggets the other one like hot dogs	2627	A
and then she makes noodles with uh with soy- uh soy sauce or whatever so all things but um yeah our favorite let me think i was thinking of the one recipe that uh	2627	A
that we made i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy and that was um	2627	A
uh scallops uh scallop um	2627	A
it has a French name it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese cream sauce with it	2627	A
and you pour it over rice yeah uh	2627	A
yeah i can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore but uh it it basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then uh standard cream sauce base and then uh	2627	A
the scallops and it sounds sort of funny but it tastes really good	2627	A
uh-huh	2627	A
yeah	2627	A
yeah but uh	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
right	2627	A
right yeah	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
yeah that's another thing i have a problem with my wife	2627	A
she uh she likes to um she doesn't like the beef dishes she likes the chicken and fish	2627	A
and like i said we always ate beef and uh pork	2627	A
you know a lot so	2627	A
oh yeah red meat plenty of good red meat	2627	A
my dad could eat a a meal with out any vegetables at all	2627	A
and uh Susan's you know they had you know meatless meals you know my dad wouldn't know what to do	2627	A
course she grew up Catholic so you know they they sort of come with the there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have	2627	A
uh-huh	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
right	2627	A
yeah it's hard to get a protein content up then	2627	A
huh yeah i like i like them every now and then for a change yes it's nice	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
yeah	2627	A
no uh he's all done yeah yeah i set him down	2627	A
yeah we used to do that um my mom used to go crazy every Sunday until my dad like blew up you know after- after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy she stopped doing it	2627	A
but um she used to have you know two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls you know every week	2627	A
and um the sticky buns of course would last you know three or four days and that would be it	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
hum	2627	A
um-hum	2627	A
uh-huh we always we had that bread that was uh um you ever seen the the starter bread i can't remember what it's called they call it the um Amish bread here but uh it's made with you just leave- leave it out	2627	A
you know and you let it spoil sort of yeah you know	2627	A
yeah	2627	A
yeah it tasted pretty good really	2627	A
but um it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad and then you add all these other ingredients to it but	2627	A
yeah right yeah- you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else and that's how they continue the thing	2627	A
yeah i know it sounded strange to me too i figure well you're baking it so you know yeah yeah	2627	A
um-hum okay well i'll talk to you later where are you calling from by the way Texas	2627	A
where	2627	A
Plano okay	2627	A
no Falls Church Virginia	2627	A
yeah i know we've got a good connection must be a uh TI connection yeah	2627	A
yeah i- i talked to so many people from Texas that's where practically everybody i talked to is from i think that's why they call me because_1 they want to get people outside the state you know	2627	A
oh	2627	A
oh really	2627	A
yeah i went to school at uh well i went to school at West Virginia University but	2627	A
but i grew up right here in Falls Church right outside DC yeah	2627	A
yeah it's sort of funny i have people that want to go to Dallas	2627	A
yeah one of my one of my friends here he was just talking how he's thinking on leaving the company and going to Dallas saying how	2627	A
yeah	2627	A
yeah we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash you know	2627	A
well Northern Virginia	2627	A
okay	2627	A
nice talking to you too bye bye	2627	A
hello	2698	B
hello	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
Berkeley California	2698	B

yeah okay	2698	B
okay	2698	B
um	2698	B
what-	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
yeah i love football football professional	2698	B
right well i'm not really from- originally from Texas but uh professional football is my favorite thing to watch really	2698	B
yeah exactly i do like uh what's his name	2698	B
what's who's the quarterback out there	2698	B
oh yeah yeah i do like him	2698	B
uh-huh	2698	B
oh really	2698	B
so they're not going to be as good this year huh	2698	B
oh yeah	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
not at all not at all i'm i'm really a a a bandwagon fan i think i like whoever is good that year	2698	B
yeah i you know	2698	B
yeah so i so i liked the Forty Niners last year	2698	B
but uh i like watching the Colts play because_1 i'm from originally from Indiana and	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
the Colts	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
yeah i know a lot of people do but uh	2698	B
we like Jeff George so it's fun to watch him play being a rookie and all last year	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
uh-huh	2698	B
well they did the wrong thing by uh releasing Landry a few years ago	2698	B
i know	2698	B
i- i liked Tom Landry you know i have no respect for the for the new coaching staff since they ousted him	2698	B
oh not i know not at all	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
So uh	2698	B
well	2698	B
well i have to admit i don't keep up with Texas i keep up with uh i'm from Purdue	2698	B
and-	2698	B
and so i keep up with what's going on up there they're going to have a new coach this year from Ohio State	2698	B
and uh they it looks looks to be promising for Purdue within the next few years so we're looking forward to seeing their program turn around	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
oh yeah you don't hear about them_1 much in fact you don't even hear about their basketball team much any more but you know	2698	B
that's how it how it goes i guess	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
uh-huh	2698	B
right	2698	B
what are they going to do about Bo this year	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
right	2698	B
oh yeah some people think they're predicting that he'll make a big comeback	2698	B
yeah i would be too	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
uh-huh	2698	B
right TI uh somehow got us on it	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
yeah	2698	B
i bet they love to talk about uh pro football don't they	2698	B
or any football	2698	B
uh-huh	2698	B

you -okay okay bye-bye	2698	B
oh	2698	A
hi hi uh can you hear me	2698	A
hi my name's Wanette Miller i'm in Berkeley California who am i talking	2698	A
yeah	2698	A
well hello Carla how are you	2698	A
i'm doing fine so you want to talk football eh	2698	A
well i guess you better push one	2698	A
yeah	2698	A
so tell me do you like football	2698	A
how could you be from Texas and not like football right	2698	A
yeah so well then in in that case you're probably a devout Forty Niners fan	2698	A
like what's his name	2698	A
Joe Montana	2698	A
yeah yeah well i don't know if you know this but do you know that that both Roger Craig and uh	2698	A
oh what is that linebacker's name	2698	A
oh Ronnie Lotte	2698	A
they're not coming back	2698	A
yeah they've signed with another team	2698	A
well i don't know those are two heavy duty players	2698	A
you know Roger Craig and Ronnie Lotte i can't imagine you know so uh	2698	A
it's just amazing you know you- i- i- i- i hope that living there in uh in in Texas you you of course don't let anyone know that you like the Forty Niners do you	2698	A
oh yeah well that's all right too	2698	A
oh oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute if- the Colts- the Colts- the Colts i still have trouble adjusting to that the Indiana Colts	2698	A
yes i guess i guess that sort of dates me but uh uh i- i still think of the Colts as Baltimore	2698	A
uh-huh	2698	A
oh yeah	2698	A
yeah for sure	2698	A
but i imagine speaking of football teams you guys have the what happened to Dallas what what whatever happened to Dallas	2698	A
i yeah i thought they were going to lynch those people	2698	A
really	2698	A
well you know how do you get rid of an institution like that and and and and justify it i mean	2698	A
that really was kind of sad i got sort of a raw deal on that	2698	A
really	2698	A
you said something you know	2698	A
uh in- in college teams you guys have some some have you got anything promising this year as far as college teams like like uh Texas A and M	2698	A
or you keep up keep up with collegiate	2698	A
oh yeah oh absolutely	2698	A
uh-huh	2698	A
uh	2698	A
yeah well Purdue's been kind of out of it for a long time-	2698	A
i- i- i didn't know Purdue i didn't even know Purdue still had a football	2698	A
yeah well it will be interesting to see well- especially you know um uh here here in the in the bay area you know this- this used to be the home also of the of the of of the Raiders and	2698	A
a lot of people here still feel that the Raiders are are are are you know in are in Oakland but uh	2698	A
i it's- it's going to be real interesting to see what happens because uh there- there're a lot of changes are happening here in the bay area as far as that they're talking about maybe getting a new stadium and with those guys leaving i mean	2698	A
Feagin and and Ronnie Lotte i- i- i can't imagine a more devastating blow to a team you know the the uh the the top running back and the top defensive player uh leaving is	2698	A
gee going to be interesting to see what happens	2698	A
uh Bo well i don't know what they're going to do about Bo Bo is is	2698	A
is pretty much out of it	2698	A
yeah i think Bo is you're talking about speaking about Bo Jackson	2698	A
well uh	2698	A
uh uh uh it just doesn't sound like that with what's wrong with him that you know we're going to find out what Bo's made out of	2698	A

well enjoyed talking to you	2691	A
i hope so right	2691	A
okay thank you same to you bye-bye	2691	A
i live in Dallas um	2691	B
right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state and a uh that goes east and west and a north south tollway	2691	B
it's no it's called 635's the highway it's the looper that goes around the city and then uh the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway just moved here about uh	2691	B
oh uh one about_1 a month ago after twenty one years two miles to the east	2691	B
so it's a very different house from the typical Dallas	2691	B
uh house	2691	B
it's about eight years old it's uh it's a duplex type thing uh very modern and um very open and airy light	2691	B
so it's different than those- than the long Texas ramblers um-hum	2691	B
what's your house like	2691	B
oh great yeah	2691	B
so it's got a lot a openness- openness- openness and light also	2691	B
oh it doesn't well that's what my wife really wanted and so uh	2691	B
yeah that's	2691	B
uh our our last house wasn't too bad but it was just too traditional and so if uh	2691	B
the next- the next time uh probably a year and a half from now we're gonna try to build	2691	B
so make one really um contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light	2691	B
no i have three in college they they usually get back for the least two of them_1 for the summer so	2691	B
but	2691	B
still need a little bit of space we we have a lot less than we had uh recently already cut back	2691	B
how big is your place	2691	B
oh that's good size	2691	B
yeah we we had	2691	B
yeah we had four bedrooms two and a half baths uh in the place we just left	2691	B
so down- now we're down to two and two	2691	B
um-hum so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home but it won't be that long because_1 we not for sure you know how long they're gonna stay or whatever	2691	B
oh yes yes and if you can get in the if- if if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal	2691	B
uh we we really didn't go that route and didn't look uh but um	2691	B
the plenty of them_1 and the and the housing market probably still gonna even go lower there are many many houses just- for sale just by the regular route	2691	B
so um	2691	B
yeah and we just decided uh uh sell and we got we got a pretty good price uh for for what we had uh not as good as it would've been	2691	B
say three or four years ago but	2691	B
that um	2691	B
that was- just the timing	2691	B
um-hum	2691	B
oh	2691	B
well yeah they're not moving very well for sure	2691	B
and that's a good uh	2691	B
example of it	2691	B
oh yeah i know where that is i've been we've been here twenty five years i'm from Missouri and my wife's from Kansas so	2691	B
i teach- i teach at a college here so it's uh	2691	B
it's sort of home now	2691	B
so	2691	B
i'm uh uh one of the Brookhaven- uh it's called Brookhaven College it's one of the community colleges	2691	B
and it's just about two miles to the west of where i'm living so it's very nice very convenient	2691	B
yeah now Richland College is out it serves Richardson and uh Garland and that's about nine miles to the east of here so uh	2691	B
anyway well it's good to hear from you and i hope we hope we did them_1 some good uh on their little computer {dealie} and uh	2691	B
uh have a good life the rest of it bye-bye	2691	B
yeah	2605	A
yeah well do you	2605	A
because uh my father and i in like back in eighty three we went camping- uh camping down the Appalachian Trail	2605	A
no no uh it was just for three days we must have done like uh sixty miles or something	2605	A
no no not at all but uh you had uh you know there was one part like we were waiting to get some water right and we were looking at where we could get some water and it said you know it was like	2605	A
we can either try to get here tonight or just sleep it and try to get there tomorrow morning and we said okay let's just sleep in and try to get there tomorrow morning	2605	A
and so when we got there the water that we were supposed to drink wasn't potable like well you couldn't drink it	2605	A
and so what we had to do is we had to get on the trail or on the road	2605	A
and start walking down the road and then we found this little hut a couple of miles down that had you know that sold stuff	2605	A
so we just stopped there uh you know had some breakfast got some water and kept on walking	2605	A
and then uh my mother who went to pick us up we had a barbecue and it was it was cool it was like you know you see a lot of deer up there	2605	A
and uh like one time i opened up the the tent and there was a deer drinking out of a stream	2605	A
and so it was it was cool you know and and it was just uh very tiring though	2605	A
okay	2605	A
yeah yeah	2605	A
right	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
yeah yeah	2605	A
yeah i was uh i told my dad you know it was like listen dad you know that i sleep a lot of hours right	2605	A
and so he goes yeah i do okay so he goes you know at least i sleep you know maybe ten hours so if we go to bed at you know eight or something right	2605	A
so he goes well if you go to bed at eight then you'll wake up like six in the morning	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
uh-huh	2605	A
it hit them wham	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
what uh do you work for TI	2605	A
oh okay	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
well it all depends on what the rapids are like	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
then then all you'll have will be road camping trips you know let's just go out to the mountains with the car honey and uh	2605	A
yeah really	2605	A
no paddling no paddling we'll just grab the rudder and you you work the rudder yeah	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
yeah but since	2605	A
but i'm a you know i'm a student and so	2605	A
and i also don't have any transportation	2605	A
and so the the people that actually do camp- do camp i don't i don't really get along with them	2605	A
you know they're like i don't know if i could stand to being you know two days in the woods with them you know	2605	A
and so because you have to know who you're going with to get along	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
yeah	2605	A
oh well	2605	A
it was nice talking to you	2605	A
bye bye	2605	A
so uh i don't know what you mean by camping but i mean tent kind of camping i guess that's what i normally do that's what-	2605	B
yeah yeah nothing like RVs or anything like that	2605	B
oh really the whole length or uh	2605	B
uh-huh	2605	B
um-hum was it very crowded out there or	2605	B
yeah	2605	B
uh-huh	2605	B
right	2605	B
yeah	2605	B
uh-huh	2605	B
sure	2605	B
yeah yeah	2605	B
um	2605	B
yeah the last the last big camping trip i was on was uh probably a few years after that but it was in the Pagosa Springs area in Colorado a bunch of us uh from here went up there and uh	2605	B
now i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain men and uh we got up there and we had the little pills you're supposed to put in the water and make sure that it's potable	2605	B
and of course we're up you know up above you know fourteen thousand feet or whatever and we said well- well how dirty could the water be right you never- never think about bacteria or amoeba or anything like that	2605	B
you think well nobody's using the bathroom farther up stream so it's got to be all right so we were doing things like uh	2605	B
you know we all had our little collapsible cups and we were going up to where the water was coming over rocks and all that and we'd just kind of stick our cups in there and drink and then we were there for five or six days and and- it was neat you know we saw deer and uh	2605	B
had to put our uh food up in the in the trees and all that i was the unlucky guy that got up every morning and said well i guess i might as well {putz} around here while everyone else is sleeping so i was usually the guy who had to get it out of the tree and all that	2605	B
yeah	2605	B
right	2605	B
that's right	2605	B
that's that's right you don't want to be the first one up and have to put the fire on and have to take- take care of everything while everyone else is sacked out	2605	B
and then if they wake up and you haven't done everything it's like why haven't you done that but uh well we were drinking you know back to that uh water thing and of course i got sick	2605	B
about the second or third -until the end of the day i'm i'm uproariously sick and i'm in the tent sweating it out	2605	B
and the two guys i was with they were like well this you're a wimp you know because we've been drinking out of the water and we're okay so they went out fly fishing and they're having a great time	2605	B
and and just all the way back to Dallas i'm just uproariously sick and uh we get back here and of course the first day back at work i go to work and where are these guys	2605	B
and they were off both off a week sick because they were just it's just like it took them a little longer to hit it hit and it hit them and they were just like calling into work going oh i'm miserable i'm i'm just	2605	B
i can't keep anything down i'm and i just cramps and i'm just going hey tell me about it right	2605	B
and uh but uh that was probably the last big camp that's probably the last big camping trip i've i've gone on i haven't gone in a few years on anything real big	2605	B
uh no no but i know somebody who does and that's how i got into this so but uh	2605	B
but in fact it's funny that's this was the topic because i was just reading Outside Magazine here this morning and uh and that some big issue on the only way to camp about about canoe camping	2605	B
and uh and i've i've done a lot of canoeing but never have camped out over night and and they makes a lot make a lot of good points about at least with a canoe you don't have to carry everything	2605	B
you can throw big tents and food and and stoves and everything in and all you have to do is just you don't even have to if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle and it's uh	2605	B
well that's true too as long as you're not going to going to hit any white water or you know if you're just doing a nice calm river it's uh it it's it uh you don't have to put very much effort into it	2605	B
and uh boys i guess as i get older that'll get more and more appetizing	2605	B
the truck and	2605	B
that's that's right	2605	B
and uh and if we're lucky we'll talk somebody into taking the car downstream and we'll just throw the canoe in there and uh and uh tell you what we'll just we'll just float downstream and uh that's that's	2605	B
that's about as tough as nope that's	2605	B
just keep us off a rock and we'll just let the let the stream take us down river and all that but uh	2605	B
but uh but uh well you over there in Carolina- North Carolina you probably get a lot of chance to you've got a lot of rivers and a lot of uh white white water over there i think	2605	B
uh-huh	2605	B
yeah	2605	B
uh-huh	2605	B
yeah yeah that's probably true because uh that's	2605	B
that's true you can't even uh because i know uh even i and my wife would probably uh have a hard time sitting in sitting out in the woods for a couple of days	2605	B
and uh you've really got to be careful who you go out there with and that they're out they're out for what they're doing and you're out for what you want to do and then you all get get to do what you want to do i guess while you're out there but uh	2605	B
well well all right bye-bye	2605	B
what are your favorite programs	2690	A
oh how funny	2690	A
i've seen the sign that goes to there i've well i think i've seen it in the distance	2690	A
but i have not even seen it and i have not seen the program	2690	A
so	2690	A
and and uh i know when we went to London it was really funny uh	2690	A
people recognized Dallas Texas by the the Texas uh the the Cowboys and by that program	2690	A
and that's that's the two things they associate with Dallas Texas so i and i they asked me several- several times they ask me why are there two bridges	2690	A
and i didn't know what they were talking about it took me a long time they're talking about the viaducts	2690	A
is that that is right isn't it	2690	A
because they ask me why are there two bridges going into Dallas	2690	A
darned if i know i was blank looking you know i felt really dumb	2690	A
well there's water in the Trinity i thought it was to going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity	2690	A
oh do they	2690	A
oh	2690	A
oh i see	2690	A
uh-huh	2690	A
i think that is just a hoot that's one of those few that i do watch and the television is on my husband likes to watch TV it's on	2690	A
i usually read and watch TV	2690	A
and usually i can handle both at the same time you know because i am pretty sure where the TV plot's going	2690	A
but that's one of the few that i just actually watch because_1 it's funny	2690	A
i really enjoy that one	2690	A
now we watch a lot of those uh and the ones that sometimes will hook me	2690	A
to put down my book will be the one there was one uh recently about the Gettysburg Address	2690	A
and they wrapped a fictional story around it	2690	A
and i thought that was well done	2690	A
and and it it caught my attention i wound up watching the whole thing	2690	A
um	2690	A
i guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year	2690	A
maybe i've spent two minutes watching to see what they have on and if they make a fool of themselves or not	2690	A
but uh they could take that whole collection and it would disappear and i'd never miss it for a minute	2690	A
particularly the beauty pageants i i particularly take issue with those i i really dislike those	2690	A
you know my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys and now	2690	A
we're out running around and if they're if they're playing he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is and he'll listen	2690	A
but even i've said hey look you're fascinated with this you sit and listen to the Cowboys let me run in here and i'll do some things and i'll come back and you don't have to miss he'll say nah nah nah	2690	A
and he doesn't he doesn't watch it he listen- like i say if it's convenient he'll listen to it	2690	A
but he just doesn't watch them_1 on TV like he used to	2690	A
oh	2690	A
oh those people yeah	2690	A
oh how neat	2690	A
well i actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans	2690	A
and i i i made the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything and uh that was	2690	A
that was a lot of fun but	2690	A
i don't know i haven't been as i'll tell you what i love to watch and this is not this is rarely on television but what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football	2690	A
yeah i like it's so much better than straight football	2690	A
it it doesn't it has a lot of different rules the field is half the size	2690	A
and there's no	2690	A
they can't call time and things like that it moves a lot faster	2690	A
uh again i think it may be on cable more than anything else we don't have cable	2690	A
well	2690	A
oh	2690	A
they're everywhere they're on every corner everything you've ever wanted to see	2690	A
well and i like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that	2690	A
or it becomes snack time for various reasons you can put you know the only thing this Dance with Wolves i want to see it in a theater	2690	A
because i understand that that your you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't	2690	A
that's what i hear too	2690	A
well my husband smokes he's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes and you can't smoke in movie theaters	2690	A
and that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies	2690	A
but i haven't really cared up until this point but i we are this weekend going to go see Dance with Wolves it's that's it we will do it	2690	A
so yeah finally	2690	A
well i tend my job tends to be very demanding	2690	A
and to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to	2690	A
uh it's kind of hard to put my finger on a on a favorite TV program however uh one that i've been watching for a number of years is Dallas and uh	2690	B
and uh it's going to be going off the air uh let's see a week from Friday- a week from tonight	2690	B
it's going to be its last show	2690	B
so i've i've kind of enjoyed watching over the years i've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it	2690	B
and uh i was uh greatly disappointed uh when i did move down to Plano to uh	2690	B
find out that the uh the uh great	2690	B
South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
oh well that's a shame	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
yes	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
well it it's uh when you look at the uh you know route seventy five coming down there i i mean it's actually a bridge but it's a bridge over top of roadway there's no water there i mean uh	2690	B
yeah well there's there um	2690	B
well they i think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas one from the east and one from the west	2690	B
and that's why	2690	B
uh it kind of confuses people but uh uh	2690	B
i enjoy a a a lot of different comedies um	2690	B
i think it's mainly for an escape	2690	B
um you know you uh my job is not the most thrilling in the world and uh i enjoy laughing and uh some of the shows that	2690	B
uh are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers	2690	B
and then there's other ones that uh deal with uh in a funny manner uh socially relevant things and uh one show that comes to mind is like Designing Women	2690	B
um	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
yes	2690	B
yes it uh it has been very entertaining and and also uh the the issues they deal with uh really tends to open	2690	B
open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems and uh i've i've really enjoyed that one since it came on	2690	B
um don't like the politics surrounding the program though but i mean other than that you know there seems to be a little fighting- in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses but uh	2690	B
and then uh i've kind of gotten hooked on PBS stuff uh public uh TV	2690	B
uh i like things like Nova and uh some of the the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff i just enjoy watching that stuff	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
uh-huh	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
well i'm one of those rare guys who i i rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event	2690	B
um if ever watch one uh there's just not that much i'm i'm interested in um	2690	B
for a while i i i watched some football but i've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and and watch a baseball game	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
well i think it was great when they were you know like world champs and they were doing real well	2690	B
i uh i personally i i came from the Washington area and so i was a big Washington Redskins fan-	2690	B
and uh when i came down to Dallas it was uh you know i found myself rooting for the home team	2690	B
i uh in fact i have a uh a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker	2690	B
the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
oh wow	2690	B
hm	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
hm	2690	B
no i haven't seen that	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
uh	2690	B
gee i'll have to try to catch that sometime if	2690	B
yeah that's probably true	2690	B
yeah we don't either i uh	2690	B
i couldn't rationalize paying you know it's like if i pay for a movie channel then i have to watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them_1	2690	B
and if i	2690	B
you know if i didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic well i can get that for free	2690	B
rationalized that it's it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see	2690	B
and of course when we were living in Texas it was real convenient with Tom Thumb you know having movies uh back then it was ninety nine cents i mean go	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
and you can see them_1 a lot sooner than you can see them_1 on any of the stations like HBO or Cinemax	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
yeah	2690	B
oh yes i do too	2690	B
yeah and i i've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it she	2690	B
she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty	2690	B
and uh you know she just doesn't like them and um she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie and i've told her you know everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick	2690	B
and uh so i'm i'm hoping i can get her talked into it soon	2690	B
hm	2690	B
um that's great	2690	B
yeah but as as far as uh regular TV shows i mean i've got some	2690	B
some shows that i that that i would be afraid to admit to you that i've actually sat down and watched	2690	B
and then there's there's others that uh uh i i wish i had time to see it's like i enjoy watching Cheers it's very funny some of the things in it are mindless but i i just don't have time to watch it	2690	B
um i think about the only night that i really sit in front of the TV set all night long probably is on Monday nights and because	2690	B
um i work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday Monday night i'm just worn out	2690	B
so i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and and look over things and i can sit in front of the TV set and look at you know	2690	B
do go through my mail and and watch TV at the same time	2690	B
um-hum	2690	B
uh-huh	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
well uh uh your you said your family was grown- uh all grown up now how about when they were younger did you go camping- take them camping	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
yeah but even-	2620	B
even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun isn't it	2620	B
oh oh uh well	2620	B
it was really my ex who did the the uh uh the cooking back when we first started	2620	B
and we found that the you know what was one one great handy things was this uh uh uh hamburger helper	2620	B
because all you needed was a big frying pan you dumped everything in together	2620	B
and it was enough for all five of us six of us	2620	B
six of us	2620	B
oh	2620	B
well that's great	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
well	2620	B
cooking was our secondary interest i mean	2620	B
well really just commune with nature	2620	B
we started out uh well we were living in Florida at the time	2620	B
and we early in life we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very very expensive	2620	B
so my ex decided we're going to try camping and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent	2620	B
and that's how we got started we did it for years and years uh	2620	B
well yes- uh yes and no i mean um yes- in the winter time yes it's it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly but uh there's really no time of the year that you can't go	2620	B
uh because-	2620	B
yes i'm in Dallas	2620	B
well it just depends on where you go for instance if you went down to the sea shore it would be wonderful a nice breeze blowing in from the water	2620	B
oh where abouts	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
oh yes yes yes- i come- i come from up in that area i'm a New Yorker myself	2620	B
a little town called Tuckaho over by White Plains	2620	B
well that i wouldn't know i left there when i was quite young	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
well uh me i outgrew uh sleeping bags and uh tents	2620	B
and i now have a motor home	2620	B
well i live in mine yes	2620	B
uh well yes i consider myself what they call a full-timer	2620	B
yeah the-	2620	B
yes- well just me and my dog	2620	B
yeah	2620	B
oh yes definitely	2620	B
nothing like the fresh outdoors	2620	B
Jack uh-huh are you uh from Dallas too Beth	2620	B
oh	2620	B
well that's where we that's where i am Plano	2620	B
it	2620	B
uh-huh	2620	B
nice talking to you too Beth	2620	B
bye	2620	B
all right i i think our experience of camping is i i am the the passive member i get things ready and then i enjoy	2620	A
uh because my my husband is a good camper and so they he manages the troops and they do the work and i have fun	2620	A
that's when we camped the most when i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families	2620	A
because uh i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing	2620	A
and having the family do a good share of the work you know and the part that i did was more fun than uh than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize you know	2620	A
it is isn't it it isn't have- what kinds of things have you tried	2620	A
have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking	2620	A
uh-huh	2620	A
oh yeah	2620	A
big frying pan-	2620	A
oh that's interesting you know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping uh when my oldest son	2620	A
uh always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything but the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh	2620	A
uh cooking merit badge in and and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef Stroganoff and uh	2620	A
i mean you know he did it up really good and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it	2620	A
it was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things like i would take corn bread and uh	2620	A
cook a pan inside of a pan over a over a camp uh stove and it works real good it's like an oven	2620	A
just put uh put a thing on it	2620	A
what did you like to do most	2620	A
that's neat isn't it	2620	A
right i agree	2620	A
huh	2620	A
well now in Florida is there is there times- are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp	2620	A
or is it always kind of hot	2620	A
uh-huh	2620	A
oh is that true now now we're we're in Texas now and you're in Texas right	2620	A
okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping	2620	A
i guess-	2620	A
yeah yeah we have done that	2620	A
but but we camped mostly when the kids were little we were in we were in New Jersey	2620	A
and we- uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border	2620	A
and we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast uh also go ahead	2620	A
oh are you where did you live	2620	A
oh oh yeah i know that i had a cousin who lived in White Plains that's a that's a neat area but it's a that is a particularly neat area for camping	2620	A
because	2620	A
yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by you don't have to go very far	2620	A
and uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things and and we had uh collapsible boat which we uh clipper little clipper sail boat	2620	A
and so we would sail and and uh did a lot of camping that way	2620	A
oh do you we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis and it's fun too i think	2620	A
do you that's neat so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper	2620	A
a full time camper well now are you living alone now or	2620	A
you and your dog huh hey that sounds great well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and	2620	A
and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life i'd always	2620	A
right i'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again so it was a neat activity	2620	A
good to talk to you tell me your name again	2620	A
Jack all right	2620	A
yes- yes we've been here we're we're in Plano but we've been here about uh eighteen years	2620	A
are you are you how about that well we're all lots of people from TI up this way	2620	A
all right good to talk to you all right all right bye-bye	2620	A
okay Jerry uh could you tell me what what type of a house you have	2651	A
uh	2651	A
and it's a vacation home	2651	A
oh i see	2651	A
okay so are you new to are you're new to Charlotte	2651	A
oh okay	2651	A
uh	2651	A
originally from Oklahoma City	2651	A
wow twenty years is a long time	2651	A
um	2651	A
so yours is your home right now is typical of the ones that are in the area	2651	A
huh	2651	A
okay	2651	A
yeah yeah oh	2651	A
um	2651	A
it's uh it's a salt box that's a it's a New England	2651	A
type	2651	A
uh i was born and brought up in the area that that i lived in and it was very rural and there was nothing there but uh	2651	A
uh farms	2651	A
uh or orchards one or the other you know there was a lot of apple orchards so when we decided to build we built	2651	A
uh about thirteen years ago uh we looked for a home and the things that we were seeing were	2651	A
uh not up to my standards they were still building homes back then like they have for	2651	A
a hundred and fifty years you know the very little insulation in the walls and very little insulation in the ceiling so	2651	A
yeah and it was uh	2651	A
it wasn't what we wanted so we did some research and i knew the land there's a lot of ledge up here so you have to be careful	2651	A
uh their septic systems when there's no uh uh public sewer system	2651	A
there is water however so we picked out a piece of land that we liked and we bought it and then we decided to build so we we did a lot of research like i said and we	2651	A
and we built a typical New England salt box in the area and when we built we were the first home there there was like about	2651	A
ten acres of oak forest around us	2651	A
and it was absolutely gorgeous uh since then however they've torn it all down and we're surrounded by homes you know that's a that's another long story but	2651	A
we're the only typical New England home in the area there's a lot of there's an English Tudor right next to us and there's uh there's a colonial our street's on just a short street there's only like six homes on it	2651	A
and there's a uh an English colonial down on the corner and the rest are raised ranches and you know the typical uh home	2651	A
but we built ours um we made uh we did it ourselves uh i sent uh uh	2651	A
some rough plans out to an architect to have him draw it up and then i subbed out the things that i couldn't do like i had a crew come in and frame it and i did the rest i did the inside the wiring the plumbing and uh you know	2651	A
so we built the walls huh	2651	A
uh my dad had built a couple when we were growing up so kind of got used to it and we did a lot of research	2651	A
uh	2651	A
we made the kitchen a working kitchen i think i would've made the kitchen uh a lot bigger because both of us like to cook	2651	A
and right now a working kitchen is very efficient but	2651	A
two people kind of get in each other's way yeah it's similar to a galley kitchen yeah and then we have uh a like a little dining area off that we have a formal dining room	2651	A
um i've since added onto the house we've got like uh uh looks like an old rustic uh log cabin on the inside	2651	A
uh it's all natural wood the ceiling's pine the walls are pine you know it's uh one of those type kick around rooms	2651	A
and we put a greenhouse on it it was uh designed to be heated by the sun	2651	A
um it works fine as long as you don't put any plants in it	2651	A
yes	2651	A
oh are you	2651	A
oh	2651	A
we raise orchids	2651	A
which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north but it's a solar greenhouse we put up you know like the walls are six inches thick	2651	A
no no we we we used uh fiberglass uh we're faced- the the greenhouse faces solar south	2651	A
and it's it's double glazed fiberglass with a one inch airspace in between it	2651	A
so it's kind of opaque we don't use shading on it um but we do have to uh have air a lot of air movement even in the wintertime it can get uh brutally hot in there	2651	A
so the way it was designed was to uh	2651	A
uh i put a four foot foundation under it and put in twenty two ton of rock with with uh hot air piped through it	2651	A
and all day long it just heats up and then at night it just gives it back into the house	2651	A
so it's it's not bad it's it's uh	2651	A
i'd like a little bit warm land i'd like to go up further north and i'd like to instead of having a salt box i'd like to have it all on on one floor	2651	A
that's right you guys must yeah because the actually the winter hasn't been really bad	2651	A
so you got your garden planted	2651	A
yeah sir	2651	A
it's it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with uh uh	2651	A
yeah no i uh i put down black plastic	2651	A
to help heat it up you know put it on the radishes and spinach but spinach kind of bolts quick on us so we put it Swiss chard instead yeah	2651	A
so anyhow that's what we've done for our house we've left it all natural so there's no upkeep you know it's white cedar shingle	2651	A
and the trim is stained so i don't have to go out and scrape and paint	2651	A
because i figured when i got old and retire i don't want to be working i don't be a slave to the home	2651	A
um right right because that peek is twenty eight feet high and you come off twenty eight feet and it hurts so	2651	A
yes you too	2651	A
okay yeah all right you take care okay bye-bye	2651	A
well at the moment i have a little vacation house back in the woods and it's brick and it has it's pine paneled	2651	B
well kind of because it's temporary	2651	B
okay and it but if you know if you want to talk about other kinds of homes my husband- uh son is a builder	2651	B
in Oklahoma City and he was visiting a couple of weeks ago so we went around to see all uh the homes that they how they build homes in Charlotte	2651	B
what kind of materials they use	2651	B
kind of originally from this area uh from Virginia uh area but yeah	2651	B
but moved here from Oklahoma City	2651	B
well no but we spent twenty years in Oklahoma we're a mobile society	2651	B
yes it is to love it	2651	B
well- in the immediate area because we're in the county with the uh	2651	B
uh farmers kind of farmers they're about you know around ninety already eighty nine or ninety but their children have grown up and they have built then more contemporary	2651	B
are more uh uh kind some ostentatious homes	2651	B
uh but all traditional they're they're uh they're some are contemporary- -contemporary but mostly traditional	2651	B
how about your home	2651	B

oh five years now i've been here long enough- pretty long so	2676	B
yes oh i've been through five of those	2676	B
right right a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple weeks in August for you know if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go	2676	B
yeah we went up to Wyoming this last uh Summer during that time and it was like you know eighty degrees up there it was beautiful it- was- nice to get out of Texas for a while	2676	B
well that's that's the even even farther away	2676	B
even in the Summer time huh	2676	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2676	B
is that right	2676	B
is that right	2676	B
um	2676	B
green	2676	B
um	2676	B
right	2676	B
no no	2676	B
right i i- i have to think every year to try to remember what it was what's it supposed to like this time of year	2676	B
yeah because_1 March we usually get a lot of rain	2676	B
in March you- you know it'll seem the the news the Harold Taft	2676	B
you know on the local news he's says oh March we typically get a lot of rain and we've had this many inches and you know we're right on target you know and	2676	B
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March but i you have to it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like but i guess yeah i wish i just wish it wouldn't come all at once and it- and	2676	B
right well it's just that you know when it rains it rains you know in California you get these nice lovely rains you know nothing really downpours- you know like downpours like you have here you know	2676	B
the other day we had some hail the biggest hail i've ever seen in Texas yeah when- i live in Garland	2676	B
yeah we got hail the size of marbles	2676	B
i mean just just so noisy hitting the house and the glass on the windows it didn't break anything but	2676	B
we went out there afterwards and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn	2676	B
i know i just you pick them_1 up you know and they're they're perfectly round you know and i go gee how did they form you know and have so perfect like that	2676	B
and-	2676	B
right right you i've- i've seen hail you know but they're usually the size you know of a	2676	B
tiny tiny pebbles you know really small	2676	B
you know but this was uh really large	2676	B
uh uh i don't know how hail's formed tell you the truth you don't think it's cold enough you know to	2676	B
to-	2676	B
right must be	2676	B
i guess and it doesn't i think you know all that falling would warm it up and melt it but it- maybe that's what rounds it i don't know but tumbling	2676	B
uh-huh	2676	B
uh-huh	2676	B
um	2676	B
yeah	2676	B
right	2676	B
right and close to that what's it's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland that's the part that always seems to to get hardest hit when there's there's the hard rain the the creek overflows and	2676	B
a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding	2676	B
okay	2676	B
right that's where i live close to that	2676	B
yeah uh uh not quite uh i don't live in that Firewheel division	2676	B
but i live close by there in north far north Garland yeah they're supposed to it it's getting built up you know with more new new shopping centers and and things you know it's a fairly new area	2676	B
yeah and uh	2676	B
and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by by the next by ninety three or ninety four or something a brand new mall	2676	B
not too far away from that area so it should be nice	2676	B
uh-huh in the Firewheel Estates there whatever uh-huh	2676	B

you you you know about August then	2676	A
okay there's no surprises left	2676	A
um-hum	2676	A
good idea real good idea	2676	A
we went to Alaska	2676	A
that is really nice it is so cool you wear a jacket you know or or	2676	A
yeah or keep one handy	2676	A
because it's it rains a lot in Alaska	2676	A
uh it they call it their liquid gold	2676	A
but it you know you get sunshine and it's lovely and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green and blooming oh my goodness it's pretty well Texas isn't bad	2676	A
not in the Spring	2676	A
Spring is nice	2676	A
right	2676	A
oh we always	2676	A
we- we always do though	2676	A
uh it	2676	A
that's right and then we get all that heat	2676	A
right	2676	A
oh really	2676	A
oh you got into that bad stuff	2676	A
isn't that strange	2676	A
isn't i	2676	A
i think that's one of the strange strange things and you very seldom see it though	2676	A
so it had come it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently is that correct	2676	A
i think- i think that's	2676	A
it's not on the ground but in in the clouds it is	2676	A
i was dumb i was in uh Florida for a week	2676	A
on business and uh i had called back to the house i stayed the weekend and i called back to the house my housekeeper was babysitting my cats and dogs	2676	A
said something to the effect of now we've made the national news don't get upset and don't worry it's in Garland where all the bad weather is i said okay	2676	A
you know and i watched the news and i thought ha ha that's Garland that's not Plano i don't have anything to worry about i was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in Garland	2676	A
felt so dumb finally i got home found out my property was okay there was no problem with it but i guess you just tend to think of of where your house is you know and nothing else	2676	A
oh	2676	A
oh i see	2676	A
oh okay	2676	A
the house that house that i bought is close to a Firewheel- Firewheel-	2676	A
Firewheel golf course	2676	A
it's just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through	2676	A
oh really	2676	A
is that a nice area	2676	A
well	2676	A
the house that the house that i bought was really really nice	2676	A
uh	2676	A
yes yes really really nice home very pretty uh	2676	A
no i'm going to lease it it's it's investment property	2676	A
but it is really it's a very nice place uh i i would cheerfully live there at you know of course it's not my home and	2676	A
and i've lived in my home in well almost ten years and you know i've got everything just exactly like i want it but if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards it's a nice house i like it	2676	A
no it's not it's off the golf course and i'll be honest with you i have- i'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is	2676	A
it's but it's in the estates that adjoin it	2676	A
yes it is	2676	A
yeah that one ninety- that one ninety is just going to be the most- outermost- outermost loop around	2676	A
right just continue to do that	2676	A
where are you from in California	2676	A
San Diego	2676	A
i've been through all of that uh there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles that's really an eerie strange looking area with boulders uh i wonder- they're not really hills they're more like just	2676	A
huge boulders with very little vegetation	2676	A
uh very-	2676	A
well you know it may be a little bit more inland that is one of the strangest areas i have ever seen	2676	A
uh i had to go up TI on business a couple of years ago	2676	A
and we went up that coastline and i was just amazed how unusual that looks	2676	A
here hang on just a second i've got a Los Angeles map let me just quick	2676	A
uh	2676	A
Simi Valley	2676	A
yes	2676	A
beyond Thousand Oaks	2676	A
you don't think that's strange looking	2676	A
oh okay maybe i'm- maybe i'm used to Texas	2676	A
the elevation is extremely high	2676	A
it's got curving roads on it but but the it's just a strange landscape there's very little vegetation	2676	A
right it's a far-	2676	A
maybe it's a place i went to it was uh far extreme thought we'd never find the place	2676	A
it was interesting	2676	A
because_1 we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way	2676	A
oh it's green sometime	2676	A
well it doesn't stay green you know the really and- and in all honesty i i know this sounds like a Texas story all honesty you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years we haven't had a really bad one	2676	A
uh it was maybe eighty two because we bought our house in eighty one and we built a pool in eighty two	2676	A
no	2676	A
uh but-	2609	B
um	2609	B
that's that's interesting because i had thought i have- feel that it's a problem also but	2609	B
i see your point on that	2609	B
uh	2609	B
apparently they don't think it's a problem	2609	B
that's right um	2609	B
right	2609	B
i i kind of feel the opposite though i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us but they're not speaking for me	2609	B
that's true	2609	B
well	2609	B
is that true i didn't know that i was thinking- that is one solution to it	2609	B
but i don't that's not really democratic not what i'd consider truly democratic	2609	B
is uh-huh	2609	B
uh-huh	2609	B
it's a duty right	2609	B
uh-huh	2609	B
uh	2609	B
it that's	2609	B
it's complex question when you start thinking about it isn't it	2609	B
that's interesting i have people here that i know that have never registered to vote	2609	B
and i think	2609	B
i think they feel they can criticize if they don't	2609	B
i told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize	2609	B
that's right i feel it	2609	B
i think it is too sometimes it is a difficult choice you don't feel as though you have much of a choice but	2609	B
it doesn't really gain anything	2609	B
is that girl	2609	B
now because-	2609	B
oh i see	2609	B
i'm interested- are you a TI employee i'm interested not okay i just wondered	2609	B
well uh maybe they should	2609	B
perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age required to register and vote for four years and perhaps	2609	B
they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty	2609	B
maybe it should go with a drivers license	2609	B
that is a privilege right	2609	B
it is	2609	B
that's correct	2609	B
maybe it should maybe it should be	2609	B
uh-huh	2609	B
that's right	2609	B
that's	2609	B
don't have a great i i think i checked that as a question i'd be willing to discuss too	2609	B
no no i haven't	2609	B
right	2609	B
uh-huh	2609	B
uh-huh	2609	B
right	2609	B
sometimes i think we have that right now with Congress	2609	B
i think they're looking after their own	2609	B
self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country	2609	B
right yeah	2609	B
well do you think uh i mean i wonder the assumption is that it is a problem uh and i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem	2609	A
and uh but it's not clear to me that it is	2609	A
um it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way	2609	A
you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem	2609	A
um-hum	2609	A
i mean i i assume that those who don't vote i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and i assume that they would vote differently	2609	A
if they were voting than your average voter but i don't know if that's the case in fact i've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't	2609	A
uh i guess not i'm i'm i vote religiously i really do um i guess i guess i'm a fan of democracy and uh wish i could vote on more things frankly	2609	A
but it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now	2609	A
the first really popular you know wide spread one was uh Proposition Thirteen which was a uh tax revolt against property taxes uh	2609	A
and you know now we're and that was whatever ten years ago and now we're up to Proposition Hundred and fifty or something like that i mean we've just	2609	A
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked being asked to make decisions	2609	A
on topics that would have three different competing	2609	A
proposals and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult	2609	A
and a lot of people revolted against that they said we don't want to have to decide all these things yeah that's that's that's why we hire people who uh you know to to make these decisions for us	2609	A
yeah	2609	A
i do too	2609	A
uh-huh uh-huh yeah i wouldn't mind having oh more votes than i get to have frankly anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as i can have their vote	2609	A
that would make me happy though maybe not in a in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would	2609	A
i don't know it's interesting uh some countries voting is obligatory uh it is in Australia for example yeah	2609	A
yeah	2609	A
i don't know how i feel about that	2609	A
well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States and it's not for me to say that they're not um they they feel i mean here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there	2609	A
you know we have just as we have a right- a duty to pay taxes	2609	A
you know is that democratic i mean we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent	2609	A
and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic	2609	A
um	2609	A
i don't know but part of me rebels against that but then i'm an American	2609	A
yeah	2609	A
yeah and some people don't vote i mean there is like three or four percent of Australians don't vote and i think they're eligible- eligible for a fine i don't know if they actually are fined or or what happens	2609	A
but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote	2609	A
uh-huh	2609	A
yeah i sort of see uh	2609	A
well i that's how i feel i mean if you if you vote and your guy looses well you least- you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote i sort of feel like	2609	A
part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know and certainly that's true in the overall i mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole i sort of feel that way	2609	A
when they especially when someone they they don't vote for someone because	2609	A
they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that and you know i say well	2609	A
you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important	2609	A
yeah yeah i mean you	2609	A
i mean it's it's funny because technically you do i mean you have the right to do a write in candidate but of course that's that's not really a vote	2609	A
um	2609	A
yes it really- really doesn't and	2609	A
so it's it's a complicated situation but i would like to see i don't know i i	2609	A
i'm i'm thinking of actually moving to Australia and and perhaps- perhaps i'll call you back and let you know what how the Australian system works i mean not because of the vote- i mean i'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity and uh i	2609	A
i	2609	A
no i'm not	2609	A
and uh so i'm i'm really quite quite curious how that would work to have both i mean you know and i believe in the in a certain uh Soviet block countries you are are obliged to vote too in fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently	2609	A
and	2609	A
that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system um	2609	A
i don't know i kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty	2609	A
um	2609	A
um-hum um-hum	2609	A
um-hum	2609	A
uh-huh uh-huh well that's a thought	2609	A
or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have i don't know the right to write your	2609	A
yeah that's see that's an example of a right not a uh not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right	2609	A
yeah but technically people most people technically it's a privilege but most people think of it as a right i mean in other words if the government denies you	2609	A
driving denies you a drivers license people get very upset but actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked	2609	A
and fortunately voting isn't that	2609	A
except well except if you're a felon if you're a felon it is taken away from you i mean they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances	2609	A
uh	2609	A
so gosh so we don't have a great solution yet do we	2609	A
but i i also i- i also i don't know if you've uh read any of the um oh what do they call those the uh the early republican	2609	A
uh republic documents uh when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people um oh Hamilton- i think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican	2609	A
not in the sense of the Republican party now versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully why the United States should be a republic not a democracy	2609	A
which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy	2609	A
where he defines democracy- democracy as everyone votes for the issues and a republic is people vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues so as you vote for representatives	2609	A
and the whole idea was um	2609	A
presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy	2609	A
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single um you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority	2609	A
and uh he makes a very uh passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process because anytime you have a majority	2609	A
um they can change the law in a democratic- a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case um	2609	A
oh you know a candidate- if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote again vote against them and cases like that he argues need to be constrained and and actually i agree	2609	A
except that i don't trust the people who are appointed to vote	2609	A
yeah well i i mean i feel that	2609	A
my you know	2609	A
yeah well their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job	2609	A
and there's also an {antigovernment} mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars and and they're all fools and you know throw throw the bastards out that kind of thing and there's a notion that somehow	2609	A
if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because i mean if i'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber i want someone trained in in it i'm very like	2609	A
well i don't know- i mean i don't know what you think about this subject i the	2640	A
i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to uh to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that i've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while we was waiting for them_1 to find somebody and i don't know that that's not a good idea	2640	A
i agree	2640	A
uh-huh	2640	A
oh yeah i agree yeah	2640	A
i don't like that no i don't like that at all i know my husband served on a on a jury	2640	A
a few months ago up here in Denton that uh was a guy it was uh it was a drug conviction and i don't remember he had some cocaine and it- it was accused of selling it and i don't remember exactly how much he had but uh actually not selling it there's a difference- couriering-	2640	A
couriering it is what and- and there's supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier if he was a courier and um	2640	A
they- they he he sat on that jury and they found him guilty and they went through the sentencing phase and everything	2640	A
and uh you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record and and they ended up the jury you know decided hey it's time to crackdown here you know and it's time to to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's really and they sentenced	2640	A
him to fifteen years you know which they thought first offense okay this is they thought that that was uh that was a good thing and they sentenced him to fifteen years and um after it was all over uh the judge- they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers	2640	A
<b_aside> let me come over in just a second okay <e_aside>	2640	A
and sat down with the judge and with the other two lawyers and they were told that uh he would probably serve three	2640	A
of the fifteen and that he had three previous convictions	2640	A
however they could not tell the judge- the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal	2640	A
so the jury didn't know about it so here they based their sentencing	2640	A
thinking that this was this guy's first offense and so you know we'll give him fifteen which'll teach him a lesson but it's not just	2640	A
you know horrible since it was first offense and he'd been convicted three times before you know and and the jury was very upset and my husband came home at home very upset i mean he felt like that that they had been tricked you know and so	2640	A
something i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change you know	2640	A
that's true that's very true yeah	2640	A
yeah obviously what we're doing is not working you know no	2640	A
yeah and there's you know there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form and either they're in there forever or when they get out they're you know it's a matter of a few months and they're gonna be right back for the same thing so the system-	2640	A
that's very true yeah i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and i said you know i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States	2640	A
to and and the- and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive	2640	A
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves i mean we and and it would- i know people say oh it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries and and maybe so so tell them you've got five years	2640	A
to work out a plan to make it on your own	2640	A
and we will continue funding you for the next two years after two years we're cut it down seventy- to seventy five- you know seventy five percent and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent and in five years	2640	A
it should- by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help	2640	A
and then we'll have all we'll have- we will have the money if we would do that	2640	A
to to work on our own system because we've got some serious problems here and we're trying to heal the world you know it's just not	2640	A
it's just not working	2640	A
i look at the i look at what you know this what were the aid we're sending to the Kurds and i- i feel sorry for them_1 and i know they're suffering and i know they're dying every day but we've got	2640	A
you know kids here in the United States that are dying every day too you know and being	2640	A
abused and neglected and you know i don't know i just have this problem with	2640	A
trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself you know so	2640	A
yeah	2640	A
i think we should try it like you say if it doesn't work we can always come back but i think it would be a good idea to try it	2640	A
so anyway well we all agree you too bye-bye	2640	A
that's not a bad idea i um	2640	B
uh that you know they probably need to change it somehow uh the whole system needs changing we've just got too many people in there and uh	2640	B
docket and are putting too many	2640	B
uh people in jail that probably don't need to be there and it's another form of sentencing but on that one thing i- i still think it should be a unanimous decision uh i think we're getting to the point now where they're gonna eventually let it be um majority vote	2640	B
and that's not gonna be good no	2640	B
right	2640	B
uh-huh	2640	B
um-hum um-hum	2640	B
oh yeah	2640	B
sure	2640	B
yeah	2640	B
yeah	2640	B
right	2640	B
that	2640	B
yeah	2640	B
and the judge might know or at least it it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better if it didn't we can come back for something else or or what we've got so well so we definitely need a change in the system and uh	2640	B
it's not working too	2640	B
it's just piling up on us	2640	B
right right	2640	B
yeah we're just not willing to as a society not willing to spend the time or the money to	2640	B
do what it takes yeah	2640	B
right	2640	B
right	2640	B
right	2640	B
yeah	2640	B
um-hum	2640	B
sure	2640	B
very true yeah	2640	B
oh yeah you're very accurate	2640	B
sure	2640	B
oh	2640	B
yeah	2640	B
right well we seem to agree on the jury thing and uh but uh we'll need an unanimous verdict and maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make the sentence yeah	2640	B
i do too	2640	B
well good good to hear from you	2640	B
bye-bye	2640	B
uh-huh	2611	B
yeah	2611	B
yeah	2611	B
uh you know that's a good way to approach it i've never thought about um i do plan my clothes a week in advance actually i plan them a month in advance i usually do a month at a time so i don't repeat an outfit	2611	B
but um i've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday because really no one's paying attention but anyway	2611	B
um i really i don't work outside of school um i work in the computer lab at school so i can just wear whatever i have on for school and	2611	B
and um	2611	B
and really it's	2611	B
i try to dress- dress presentable but very comfortable	2611	B
like um in the warm weather it's always shorts and a T-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or or pants i usually um you know college is so casual you really don't want to dress up unless you	2611	B
you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that	2611	B
so	2611	B
yeah	2611	B
um-hum	2611	B
oh	2611	B
well that's good that they're so casual i mean uh my brother works for TI and he's a computer programmer or computer engineer	2611	B
and um you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday but uh he goes to work in his blue jeans T-shirt and tennis shoes and he just loves it	2611	B
yeah	2611	B
that's what i've heard	2611	B
but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building he calls it the new building i don't know it's where all the executives are	2611	B
and um	2611	B
and so they were they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans but he just left for Italy today at four	2611	B
and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them	2611	B
over in TI mean for TI but over in Italy uh	2611	B
oh yeah he was so excited about going	2611	B
but uh he didn't carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude that well if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it because_1 uh he just	2611	B
he didn't you know he's not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a T-shirt so	2611	B
but i think that's great about TI and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff i think that's great	2611	B
oh really do you smoke	2611	B
uh-huh	2611	B
i think that's um	2611	B
well um you- you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and	2611	B
uh	2611	B
see that's how that's how i am but my mama was not raised like that and so	2611	B
oh me to boy i have to hunt- hunt them down	2611	B
uh-huh	2611	B
that's great	2611	B
i wanted to take a sewing class at school but i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet but that i mean that can really benefit	2611	B
um that's something that i'd be very interested in very interested in learning	2611	B
uh they're outrageous	2611	B
uh-huh	2611	B
yeah it's it's marked up	2611	B
it is it is really outrageous but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom i never understood this then but i do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or	2611	B
um or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and she always told me it was because i was still growing and she wasn't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week	2611	B
yeah	2611	B
oh no	2611	B
um-hum	2611	B
that's the best way to shop i mean i always thought my mom was being mean to me but i look back at it now and my child is going to i mean i'm going to raise mine the same way	2611	B
um	2611	B
i don't know i just	2611	B
ah they're just so outrageously priced it's just incredible i try to uh always catch the sales	2611	B
always	2611	B
yeah it it depends on um	2611	B
yeah there's there's always a reason why they're on sale	2611	B
so that that has a lot to do with it	2611	B
but um	2611	B
well	2611	B
uh-huh	2611	B
oh that's great	2611	B
huh oh	2611	B
oh no	2611	B
uh-huh	2611	B
the defect	2611	B
uh-huh	2611	B
TJ Max does that yeah we have a TJ Max over here and um	2611	B
okay	2611	A
um i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know TI is a very casual atmosphere	2611	A
and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five outfits	2611	A
and uh on Monday i i wear the the worst looking one because and it doesn't seem like people are really are you know are that alive on Monday you know so	2611	A
and then progressively through the week i'll i'll wear nicer looking things and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans jeans and sweatshirts	2611	A
or you know jeans and blouses or something like that	2611	A
uh but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and	2611	A
uh pullover sweaters or	2611	A
uh	2611	A
you know little two piece dress suits- suits like but	2611	A
um-hum	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
right	2611	A
right like where i work it's it's pretty casual um	2611	A
it's it's i guess it's more like a a college campus also i mean there's hundreds- you know hundreds of people work for TI	2611	A
and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time	2611	A
and they dress up like when customers are coming in or uh when we have department meetings or something like that and um	2611	A
you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real um higher ups like the the lawyers- the TI lawyers and uh	2611	A
those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries	2611	A
they uh they really dress up all the time so there's a good combination in the hallways all the time you know	2611	A
yeah	2611	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
and that's very acceptable at TI i believe at IBM they they make you wear a blue suit and uh some kind of colored shirt and a tie	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
i would- i would hate to be in that atmosphere	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
uh	2611	A
oh	2611	A
i see	2611	A
yeah oh TI is everywhere	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
that's true that's a good idea	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
the no	2611	A
right	2611	A
yeah and if you happen to go into one of the areas that is a smoke smoke area and you don't smoke you almost strangle	2611	A
because_1 there is so much smoke in the air	2611	A
yeah areas the smoking area you know it's closed in and if you don't- if you don't smoke and you go in there that- everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when when you go in there	2611	A
i used to smoke a long time ago i used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes that's one of the reason that i stopped	2611	A
yeah she always had uh yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
no i i wasn't either she my daughter um	2611	A
she's real good at finding sales though you know she- she- she'll buy a lot of she- yeah she'll buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons you know and uh just have them for the next year	2611	A
and she you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places	2611	A
and uh buys clothes	2611	A
um when- you know when they were coming up i i didn't sew but now i've i've learned how to sew so i'm well i'm i'm still learning how but i'm getting- and i'm getting much better at it and i	2611	A
i'm going to be able to make my own clothes	2611	A
right	2611	A
right because clothes are some- are really expensive you know uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about	2611	A
say ten dollars at you know at at the most out of a decent fabric	2611	A
boy runs you like twenty something dollars in the store	2611	A
just a little shell to go under a suit you know	2611	A
uh-huh	2611	A
right especially to- to pay that kind of money for it	2611	A
i have a friend who um she had a she had a baby- a little boy	2611	A
and uh she- she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus i mean she dressed him	2611	A
oh fabulously	2611	A
and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know	2611	A
so now she	2611	A
finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else	2611	A
right	2611	A
yes and yourself-	2611	A
right	2611	A
and yeah and you just have to keep buying them	2611	A
you know if you if you if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay	2611	A
right	2611	A
right	2611	A
like i bought i bought the most	2611	A
beautiful sweater- uh sweater	2611	A
from uh i believe it was Ross Dress For Less	2611	A
and it was- it was really pretty it was just you know it was just plain a plain uh round- you know round uh necked	2611	A
uh sweater- sweater	2611	A
and it had	2611	A
uh like it was embellished around the the top you know it had uh leather leather designs and	2611	A
um	2611	A
some other- other little things on it and i just thought it was so pretty and i got- i got it at a real good price i think maybe it was nine ninety nine or something and it was so pretty	2611	A
why it was it was so cheap	2611	A
there was in the middle of the back of it there was	2611	A
it's like there it had been slit and they had like just sewed it back together	2611	A
right in the middle of the the back you know wasn't a seam or anything you know	2611	A
and that's why it was so cheap although it's not it's not really noticeable	2611	A
um from the outside but but still it's you know it's really not not not a good quality	2611	A
and then i was told by somebody that works for JC Penney's that um Ross Ross is just one of those places that sells- sells seconds	2611	A
yeah yeah um	2611	A
they don't really buy the first quality they buy the second	2611	A
and uh places like JC Penney's that they'll reject the seconds they'll send them back every time but	2611	A
places like Ross Dress For Less and uh TJ Max um uh-huh	2611	A
um just here in Dallas	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
that's yes yes that's true i've talked uh-huh people from Virginia and and all over yeah	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
oh okay um well the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is uh food	2679	B
what type of foods do- do you cook and what would you uh cook in uh uh let's see if you were giving a dinner party and the only reason why i may know a little bit about this is that i'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon and to me that's the type of thing that i like to-	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
yes	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
what kind of meals did she make that you liked	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
huh	2679	B
no	2679	B
sounds interesting uh-huh yeah that's great	2679	B
yeah yeah but uh that's that's why i like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better people can entertain themselves i think a great deal	2679	B
more uh when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and uh you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kebabs where you have to do a whole bunch of work	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
right	2679	B
yeah yeah well i i think you do do a lot of work even if people do bring over things you still do uh all the uh housework and get everything- everything prepared and uh utensils and just just everything	2679	B
uh but you know my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish i'm thinking about uh special dishes and uh yeah it was made out of um rice and consume soup uh and bacon and onions	2679	B
and then you'd simmer it like all day long	2679	B
oh it would- because	2679	B
yeah and it was just it was just wonderful that's that's something that i would really like to uh to try and find the recipe for but we used to have that at Thanksgiving time	2679	B
because you can you can put it on top of the stove and do this and and there's so much broth and juice in there that it has to uh soak up into the rice all day long in order for it to uh uh to come out fluffy and and nice	2679	B
and that was you know when you were talking about the the Polish dishes uh some goulashes and things like that that's uh that's what i thought about was that Armenian rice dish	2679	B
that's true	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
right right	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
oh	2679	B
uh-huh yeah	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
right right	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
yeah you know what i found was at Sam's uh wholesale uh stores and uh what they have is this honey baked ham that you- have you seen have you had any of those	2679	B
if if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was uh twenty dollars for uh i don't remember how many pounds it was but you cook it in the bag that they send it in and it's all the juices and everything are all sealed in and i tell you what if	2679	B
it's never failed to come out tender and juicy and just and just delicious because i normally don't like ham because it's so salty	2679	B
but with this honey bake that they have that that's the only one i have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse it is absolutely delicious and it slices great um-hum um-hum	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
wow you know that sounds like it	2679	B
but that's that's the only ham i have found that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy	2679	B
wow	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
right	2679	B
right	2679	B
that's true i don't- i don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and cholesterol and and all those good things	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
oh yeah well my parents actually started it and uh getting	2679	B
well it it's true i think my parents are very unusual because uh we grew up in the south where uh you have all the um	2679	B
you know biscuits and gravy and oh fried foods galore and then gradually they started switching over to um plain rice um	2679	B
no gravy it's just it really is they uh they're actually they actually uh uh led us through it versus um	2679	B
us teaching them you know the uh the finer points but my mother has really high cholesterol so it was one of the reasons which started them off and they started doing this like in the early or in about the middle seventies uh yeah	2679	B
it's true it's true i agree with you so it's really neat	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
that's right	2679	B
right	2679	B
um-hum um-hum	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
wow um-hum	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
wow	2679	B
huh	2679	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2679	B
um-hum	2679	B
wow that's good	2679	B
uh-huh	2679	B
okay where were you where were you from	2679	A
oh okay because i uh i talked to a professor in uh	2679	A
what was it uh North Carolina who got the the TI	2679	A
system and he gave to all his students so my daughter's even talked to and i've talked to several people from North Carolina i was just curious	2679	A
have you too	2679	A
yeah i talked to the professor and i asked him about it and he said oh he says i think i'm the guy that actually uh gave it to all my students so that's why so many people are from this college uh go ahead- you you first	2679	A
food	2679	A
oh great	2679	A
yeah we have them too and i i'm trying to think which is the best uh that i prefer uh my wife uh	2679	A
doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it uh and we haven't catered out very much uh we would- i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be the man always gets that chore and you have to make it perfect uh	2679	A
i've made shish kabob which i like it's fairly easy and fast	2679	A
uh where i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do	2679	A
for for having uh	2679	A
uh a dinner	2679	A
i do cook but not i'm mostly the easy cooker you know the breakfasts and and the steaks uh although i would like to experiment with uh	2679	A
the meals my mother made you know so to speak and i haven't gotten around to that yet uh	2679	A
well she was Polish and uh	2679	A
she would make very economical meals we were very poor different rice and ham and things that uh she would throw things together	2679	A
and {galunkies} and all that and uh i would like to try that one day and she would make	2679	A
spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything and my wife of course thinks i'm crazy which i may be too but uh	2679	A
yeah	2679	A
but dinner parties are a lot of work uh	2679	A
yeah	2679	A
yeah	2679	A
yeah well that that that shish kabob is uh	2679	A
just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh	2679	A
so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a little- a few minutes uh but anyway i'm i'm thinking of the easy way rather than my guests i guess but uh	2679	A
right	2679	A
right	2679	A
uh-huh yeah	2679	A
oh yeah	2679	A
right you'd get the odor of it yeah	2679	A
uh-huh yes	2679	A
oh great	2679	A
oh yes we probably ought to try this but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered i guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know but we probably should try it uh to do that uh	2679	A
the recipes are really interesting you know we're probably going to lose them we'll probably forget all about them you know since we're trying to make everything so simple- here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know	2679	A
i uh you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times uh something see- my wife's from Texas so uh remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey and uh we were going over to my mother's house for	2679	A
Christmas you know to have a meal and we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said oh i'm looking forward to a nice turkey i said turkey i said we don't have turkey at Christmas i said we only have turkey on Thanksgiving i said we're going to have a ham she said what	2679	A
i said yeah i said no turkey is only for Thanksgiving and because she had turkey a lot you know and uh that was surprising in the in the east uh we always had ham you know	2679	A
and- and and that's one thing also- that's another recipe i guess we could talk about	2679	A
now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or or uh a package sliced uh the cans were cooked for hours and hours and and were just wonderful you know i i'd like to try that too	2679	A
yeah	2679	A
oh yeah i saw them_1 that's good	2679	A
no i- i uh i- i've i know about but i think goes	2679	A
um-hum	2679	A
oh really	2679	A
oh i haven't heard of that yeah	2679	A
yeah	2679	A
oh yeah i'll have to ask her about that	2679	A
uh because_1 we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells i can't think of his name of it uh	2679	A
i don't know i see a can here or a box here Gourmet Choice uh he delivers uh what is the name of this thing	2679	A
i got a box where is it distributed marsh it doesn't say	2679	A
Gourmet Choices but he but- it's a company that has uh you know a truck that comes around and and they recently had hams they have steaks and	2679	A
and uh actually pierogies and all that stuff that uh	2679	A
i- i never i wish i could tell you the name of the company but i don't know what it is but uh they recently had a ham that was supposed to be it was boneless and we tried it it was real nice and it was fully cooked and everything we had it for breakfast a long time it was really great	2679	A
yeah	2679	A
i would like to try the old recipe though of cooking it and and i keep saying this uh	2679	A
to to do the different things that we did but i would like to put one in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if because i don't think in my married life which is uh twenty six years now	2679	A
we've never done that you know and i remember that when i was a kid uh to have the ham cooking uh rather than that we just ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know and that's it you know	2679	A
in the old days we had hams were the meal and i don't i don't think we really have it as a main meal	2679	A
right yeah that's an interesting point how how have you changed your your meals now have you into that uh looking at those things	2679	A
uh-huh	2679	A
parents that's unusual	2679	A
oh yeah	2679	A
that's amazing	2679	A
yeah	2679	A
well that's amazing they'd go that they have started usually it's the younger people doing it yeah	2679	A
i uh my my wife's mother is the only grandparent left and uh she has high cholesterol of course i have- i have too but not like hers	2679	A
and i always get after her about salt and everything else and she just will i mean she's going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life and she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know	2679	A
and uh i like to try- i'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way uh	2679	A
uh it's it's not the i listen to uh Larry Newarth on the weekend he's a fitness expert and uh he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else and	2679	A
you know try that sometime my wife says she can't stand it but uh when i make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe	2679	A
i say if i have four eggs not not for me but if i'm making four eggs uh even for my daughter and i i'll take out all the yolks but one	2679	A
and it's fine you you don't miss it uh in fact when i when i make eggs for myself	2679	A
if i if i fry them throw them in there i will	2679	A
almost hard fry them	2679	A
so i can take not eat the yolk at all	2679	A
and you don't really miss it you get the flavor of the yolk	2679	A
but uh you don't eat it at all you know you don't or hardly you get like uh a bite at at the- the most	2679	A
and so uh for cholesterol i mean i'm trying that and it has worked my cholesterol gone down twenty points uh although	2679	A
i haven't gotten on the which whether was it butter or cholesterol- not cholesterol margarine and all that i don't know know whether any of that is true you know whether the margarines are butter	2679	A
okay you've do you have a uh monthly budget	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
right	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
right	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
right	2697	A
well we're very very similar we i have worked	2697	A
for a goal of saving three months' salary	2697	A
and and we put that uh in a account	2697	A
and we just leave it there that's our emergency account if the car breaks down i mean we can take money out of that but you know then our goal after the next month is to rebuild it up to three months' salary	2697	A
now we've only we've recently done that so now we have extra money	2697	A
we don't have to slap in that account so we're looking into mutual funds or uh just uh common stock you know anything like that that we can get a higher return on our money	2697	A
uh see we do have the checking account we have Carla works for TI so she has a CODA plan you know where she puts in if they put in a dollar she- she puts in a dollar you know TI pays fifty cents	2697	A
it's sort of like a matching fund then she gets like eight percent interest on top of that so that's been uh	2697	A
pretty juicy for last couple of years	2697	A
and	2697	A
um-hum	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
no well they may have we just haven't taken advantage of it	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
right	2697	A
right	2697	A
huh so	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
so if you don't use it in one year you lose the hum	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
well it's time to go get your teeth cleaned again	2697	A
oh yeah that's that's true too	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money we're going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it	2697	A
so for those people that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at the end of the month and so do we because_1 i hate interest	2697	A
so i mean but some people don't care about interest	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
right it's a vicious circle	2697	A
yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly	2697	A
but they can be very dangerous if you don't	2697	A
especially yeah that interest is terrible	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
oh yeah	2697	A
no kidding	2697	A
but	2697	A
yeah that sounds like you uh now what are you doing you've got your big master savings account that you're going to use to retire on or something or	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
oh man	2697	A
oh	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
yeah yeah we i just did that my wife's birthday was yesterday and yeah so	2697	A
i'm very tight you know with my cash and we haven't really we don't go to malls and shop because_1 they're too expensive and you know we'll buy things here and there but she had we haven't really went shopping for her	2697	A
and you know but she's been really good and she hasn't really said much and i go well look you know today we're going to go out and get something so we went out and blew about a hundred bucks but you know for us that's a that's huge for me you know but you know some people do it every weekend	2697	A
but	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
yeah	2697	A
uh oh you're not cooking are you	2697	A
that's funny	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	A
well that's good	2697	A
that's good	2697	A
sounds like uh you know what you're doing	2697	A
did i have to train her	2697	A
no she she's really good she uh she didn't uh	2697	A
you know she doesn't go out and buy clothes without me knowing it and like Blondie in the cartoons you know she doesn't do anything like that she's not big on sales and all that she's just really she's really great she's really content and just uses what she has and then	2697	A
you know she just you know some day	2697	A
uh-huh	2697	B
well um	2697	B
we we do but not an official one i mean basically we know we have i- i think i'm a little crazy in that we keep so many different savings accounts	2697	B
we'll have our checking account that's just the the money that we use and spend	2697	B
and then we have a savings account which is money where we work our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything and then we write it out like it was a check	2697	B
so we're never- we pay off our bills in full we're not paying any interest but it's not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have it all written out already	2697	B
and then we have another checking account- another savings account which is like for heavy duty savings you know that's just taken out of our paychecks every week	2697	B
and then we have a a fourth sort of CD type arrangement um where you know it's in a CD and we can't get to it	2697	B
so i guess our budget is just what's in our checkbook we don't say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas it's just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two times some weeks one time some weeks three times	2697	B
um so there's nothing really that we have written down for a budget	2697	B
but i'm a saver i would rather if i had twenty extra dollars i would rather save it than spend it and that's my philosophy and um	2697	B
sometimes i- i you know i think that that's not necessarily the best way to live but i- i always think that you're going to need it for a rainy day you know how about_1 you	2697	B
yeah	2697	B
wow	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
right	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
oh	2697	B
oh that's great	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
um-hum yeah that's wonderful	2697	B
one nice thing that my company does um and i know this is going on all over the country but	2697	B
they allow you to put into um a certain fund	2697	B
whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that	2697	B
any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related	2697	B
and so you claim that amount at the beginning of the year let's say you determine that's five hundred dollars	2697	B
they'll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck um broken up into fifty two weeks so whatever that is divided by fifty two	2697	B
and what- what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars	2697	B
do you have something like that	2697	B
it's really wonderful in our case we don't have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim two hundred dollars	2697	B
so i my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars	2697	B
and they break that up into three dollars and eighty five cents a week that's taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for thirty dollars	2697	B
i pay the thirty dollars and then i send it in to the it's Blue Choice i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for thirty dollars but the nice thing is that that thirty dollars i wasn't taxed on	2697	B
initially because_1 it it almost looked like i never made that thirty dollars and it's really wonderful if i this is the first year we did it and uh next year	2697	B
i i'm just going to claim a lot more if you don't spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even two hundred dollars more from it	2697	B
but uh it's a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing	2697	B
but um	2697	B
yes if you don't lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside five hundred dollars and you only spent four fifty	2697	B
they let you know each quarter and they'll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you haven't spent that fifty then you do lose it	2697	B
yeah right or just buy a new set of glasses or or whatever	2697	B
but i- i don't know how people can really live on a budget our i mean a budget that's really written out	2697	B
um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean each week is so different some weeks you're just going to go over that and some weeks you're going to go under and so to me it's just easier to	2697	B
i don't know	2697	B
yeah that's true that's true	2697	B
right	2697	B
that's true yeah a very good point	2697	B
yeah	2697	B
right oh i hate it too	2697	B
well you you know some people look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um	2697	B
you know if their limit is twenty five hundred dollars if they have a hundred left they'll spend that because they think they have it	2697	B
and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically	2697	B
yeah it really is	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
oh they sure can that's for sure	2697	B
i know	2697	B
and you know they send these applications out to college kids and college kid gets an application that says you've been approved for this amount of credit	2697	B
automatic approval	2697	B
and they get them and then these kids start charging and	2697	B
but	2697	B
well it'll be a long time before that's something we can retire on but um	2697	B
it's yeah it's just uh something that's automatically taken out of our paychecks each week and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here about seven weeks ago and	2697	B
Rochester was in a state of emergency for three weeks and everyone lost their power and we had to pay over five hundred dollars to have a tree removed	2697	B
and it wasn't covered by insurance so that's something where you- you don't plan on it's not something that you can you know you're not saving for a trip or whatever it's boom here it is	2697	B
and you just have to pay for it so it's an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that that's what's put in the CD	2697	B
and to me i- i try and forget that we even have that because i don't want to think about that um	2697	B
but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a twenty dollar bill and think oh maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this and it'll come	2697	B
ah really	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
oh yeah it'll	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
oh	2697	B
oh isn't it great	2697	B
oh i know you mean um-hum	2697	B
oh it's incredible	2697	B
we really do	2697	B
i- i- i like discount stores i have no problem with buying an a no name brand of something	2697	B
um i'm not into labels and that sort of thing	2697	B
our fire our smoke detector's going off making French fries	2697	B
um my husband's making French fries or burning French fries one or the other but um	2697	B
i feel fortunate that my parents instilled in me you know a sense to save and and you know watch where your money goes	2697	B
and i that's very valuable yeah yeah	2697	B
yeah i hope so we do you too was your wife always like this or was she did you have to	2697	B
yeah	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
i know kind	2697	B
um-hum	2697	B
that's great	2697	B
well	2613	B
uh i've noticed some changes over the past uh thirty years	2613	B
that uh	2613	B
that it's gotten worse	2613	B
i can remember uh back in the early sixties when i first started flying a light plane	2613	B
it was quite common for me to take off from uh local airport here and see the uh Appalachian mountains and the Chesapeake Bay at the same time	2613	B
and in the you know fifteen years later it was a rare occasion that i could see both at the same time	2613	B
yeah i know uh lot of times when i was coming back home i would uh file instrument flight plan just to get into the Washington area	2613	B
but i counted on North Carolina having some good weather for me	2613	B
well down there you get uh uh some more aromatic aromas like the uh the smell of the pine forest and uh	2613	B
then you get down wind of a paper mill once in a while	2613	B
um	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
well i'm not sure that we're going to be able to uh solve much of the problem	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
well one of the reactions i have is that uh they put so much emphasis on the private automobile	2613	B
uh as being a major source of pollution and they've uh ignored the trucks entirely	2613	B
so i i get to going down the expressway in the morning and uh i don't see very many cars smoking	2613	B
but	2613	B
then i i get surrounded by twenty or forty trucks and they're just laying out a pall of black smoke	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
yeah i know along route sixty six the uh people who have residences there	2613	B
uh they can't paint their houses without cleaning them first	2613	B
uh	2613	B
if they're within a block of a major expressway the houses get coated with oil	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
yeah i'm not sure that we're not seeing some of the effects of that already	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
well we've sort of been seeing a little climatic shift here on the East Coast or at least it seems that way that uh the winters have been milder for the last five years and uh	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
yeah the first the first winter i moved out here i had a big snow plow on the tractor and i had to use it we had three uh fourteen inch uh snows	2613	B
and i haven't used it since	2613	B
and at the same time i i see some colder winters in the Midwest i think they've gotten more snow in the past five years than we're having here on the East Coast	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
oh i didn't know that	2613	B
huh	2613	B
well it may have been uh the fact we had this early season warm spell	2613	B
that did that because i know that the the preceding- the preceding day Thursday i got my first sunburn for the season out on uh Ocean City Beach	2613	B
yes	2613	B
i didn't notice that uh know that they'd discovered any thinness or over metro- metro areas i'd only heard about the uh North and South Pole	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
yeah that that doesn't uh fit my picture of uh of uh meteorology i can understand the Poles because they're uh a permanent high pressure area	2613	B
and uh you know there isn't that much uh circulation	2613	B
but uh the temperate zone is uh a constant moving uh wind system	2613	B
and it's i'm surprised that the ozone doesn't have it's own wind pattern	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
cold fusion right	2613	B
the same thought flashed in my mind	2613	B
yeah i uh	2613	B
i may have put out an exclamation here at home when i heard that news	2613	B
and uh everybody wanted to know why i was so excited and i tried to explain to them	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
uh-huh	2613	B
yeah	2613	B
i think so	2613	B
except we might have uh bad case of paladium poisoning now	2613	B
i know there was uh a pipeline going in up in uh	2613	B
southern Pennsylvania	2613	B
and there was a group	2613	B
in uh Bucks county that was fighting it	2613	B
and uh one of the women that was leading the group said well they say they're going to pump uh oil through there but before long they'll be pumping radioactivity through it	2613	B
so what do you think about it	2613	A
um for the worst i would assume	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
uh-huh	2613	A
uh-huh	2613	A
you're probably lucky to see the end of the runway by now	2613	A
um	2613	A
well i'll tell you i don't know i i don't know whether i i i count the stink as part of air pollution and it stinks down here	2613	A
it depends on where you are now if you're over	2613	A
yeah if you if you're over by Asheville you're you're pretty good because you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice ozone and all that	2613	A
over here in Raleigh it's kind of flat and stagnant and	2613	A
just yucky	2613	A
it's fine over on the coast because you've got the you've got the breezes off the off the water there	2613	A
but uh seems like it's just dull and uninspiring here	2613	A
no i don't know they're they keep doing things and it doesn't seem to be doing any good	2613	A
i was i was really amazed because i never would have expected you know this problem somewhere like in Atlanta	2613	A
and i drove through Atlanta uh couple of weeks ago and it was unseasonably warm	2613	A
and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city	2613	A
and when i drove through i was it was terrible i had to keep the windows up	2613	A
it was just so thick and uh	2613	A
heavy	2613	A
uh i couldn't believe it i because i mean- i used to live in Atlanta years ago and it was always fairly clean i mean you you always you didn't have problem with stagnant air like like LA does	2613	A
but boy it was really bad that day	2613	A
and it	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
yeah right	2613	A
but you see all these all these trucks belching out this black smoke	2613	A
yeah i know it's	2613	A
i i i i don't understand where the priority is it's uh like in Atlanta they have um they have mandatory catalytic converter inspections	2613	A
there's only three places in Georgia that requires that	2613	A
and uh even with that it hasn't done any good	2613	A
i mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse	2613	A
but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and they're just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it	2613	A
you know i don't know	2613	A
uh-huh yeah because of the stuff settles on it	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
i don't know things like you know well like acid rain and all these sulphur dioxides being dumped out there	2613	A
i i'm more worried about that than i am just about anything else	2613	A
because uh	2613	A
uh it's it's all i mean it's just like- it's just like a big avalanche you know you start putting sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and you end up with acid rain acid rain kills trees	2613	A
the trees don't scrub the air and there you are	2613	A
and then of course you've got all these folks cutting down on the rain forest as quick as they can	2613	A
i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this	2613	A
it it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're losing the most most of the forests	2613	A
because i i i think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being taken out of the air	2613	A
uh	2613	A
you know by the plants and the trees and all that good stuff and here we are losing it and now the now it doesn't have any where to go	2613	A
but ozone-	2613	A
uh-huh yeah well it's like our winter here i mean it was the winter that wasn't you know we were having having hot days in December and January	2613	A
and got in	2613	A
uh-huh	2613	A
uh-huh	2613	A
uh-huh	2613	A
yeah you might- you might as well sell it for scrap or something because you probably never will use it	2613	A
it's a shame too because i miss all the cold weather i i enjoy winter	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
yeah well- it was an interesting day the other day uh i think it was um yeah it was last not not this past Friday but Friday a week ago	2613	A
we had- i don't know i think you had some bad weather up there too we had tornadoes and everything down here	2613	A
um that was the most historic weather day in recorded history for severe weather in the country	2613	A
on that one day i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere	2613	A
but there was more of it on that one day than ever recorded before over four hundred reports of tornadoes hail and heavy winds	2613	A
amazing	2613	A
it's a little bit scary	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
um	2613	A
i read an article a couple weeks ago they were talking about uh uh talking again about the ozone layer they said that the uh	2613	A
the ozone deterioration is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major metropolitan areas that's a little bit scary to think about	2613	A
because that's certainly not going to improve things around there	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
well that's that's yeah that had that had been the thing that had always i mean i i i have always thought about the ozone layer as sort of like a layer and it would move around i didn't know that the hole just stayed there	2613	A
you know i guess i i don't- i'm not that much of a meteorologist	2613	A
but uh yeah i was a little surprised at that too because up to that point all i'd heard about was the one over the pole	2613	A
and i said well i'm not too awfully concerned about that if it's going to start melting the ice cap it's not going to be for a long time yet	2613	A
but opening opening up over major metropolitan areas now that's that's	2613	A
yeah yeah	2613	A
yeah course the ozone is up there so	2613	A
yeah i mean- i mean didn't- i don't even know i don't even know if the ozone layer does move i mean apparently it doesn't but	2613	A
of course it it might be just a couple of scientists trying to get their name in the paper sort of like cold fusion	2613	A
yeah i'll tell you i i was real excited when i first heard that i said hot dog they finally did it you know	2613	A
um i too-	2613	A
i mean i'm	2613	A
yeah i mean i'm an old science fiction buff from way back when i was a little boy and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of	2613	A
and it's the days that i keep looking for that aren't going to happen in my lifetime	2613	A
but	2613	A
you know we're supposed to have moon colonies by now	2613	A
but uh yeah cold fusion would have been great	2613	A
could have gone might have started making a little inroads on air pollution with that	2613	A
but who knows	2613	A
yeah	2613	A
yeah there's always- there's always a drawback to everything i mean	2613	A
i don't know	2613	A
well	2613	A
okay	2613	A
well it'll be real easy for us because we're both my husband and i are vegetarians so yeah so that's the first thing we look for is if we can eat there or not	2693	B
we're not vegan vegetarians we do we're {ovolacto} we do eat uh eggs and and milk products i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian where i didn't eat any animal products at all	2693	B
but um it was it's really difficult in the area if you don't have you know the products that you can get and if you go out to dinner there's virtually you know there's not a whole lot of things you can get	2693	B
yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like California where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff but here basically you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant you know where you can get foods that	2693	B
you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal you know or something	2693	B
but	2693	B
yeah yeah you have to watch that too all you know some of the restaurants here they will you know like you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal fat to cook with	2693	B
so but so that's that we don't really eat out too much we we tend to eat at home and actually you know i think we we we get a have- we have a healthier diet than the average person	2693	B
um i've been a vegetarian for uh two years now my husband has been one for oh just over a year now and uh so	2693	B
definitely and it it makes you more aware of what you're eating because you you have to be i mean you you i think you	2693	B
you you balance the foods uh you know you're more aware of what nutrient you know value each thing has and minerals and you're just more aware of food for energy for energy sake	2693	B
well that's just it you you do have to figure it out and and you know to get proteins and things and when i was a vegan it's you know you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you you're not even getting through your milk products your egg products	2693	B
if you don't eat any of those but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables i mean there are there are there are you actually you can get more calcium through	2693	B
leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products a lot of people don't know that well the thing is that milk products our bodies don't uh	2693	B
don't uh the the lactose that kind of milk it doesn't our we we tend to uh what's it called we don't synthesize the the calcium the same way	2693	B
yeah we we slough some of it we we send we send some of it out because it our body doesn't accept some of it	2693	B
so we're not utilizing we're when it when it gets rid of some of that um that we can't use it get rids it gets rid of some of the calcium	2693	B
whereas we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it you utilize- your your body accepts all of the broccoli	2693	B
so it's like it's like say a person using vitamins as opposed to uh vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food	2693	B
your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the the vitamins in	2693	B
uh supplements that it does in regular food you know so but we both we both feel much healthier much healthier and i couldn't consider going back to eating	2693	B
yeah well now i changed for ethical reasons and my husband	2693	B
has changed he feels more ethically about it but he	2693	B
he in the beginning began for health reasons	2693	B
but um	2693	B
now he he feels like i do that	2693	B
yeah plus he eats we both think more about i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating	2693	B
you know as far as a living creature and now we both think a lot of well what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies too so	2693	B
um-hum yeah	2693	B
um-hum	2693	B
well we do too i mean i was raised in um we're in cattle country and people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer you know and that	2693	B
you know i suppose if you really believe in something it's	2693	B
you you adjust your life because your mind you your you inside yourself you just it's not right	2693	B
so but um	2693	B
oh yes	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
so what do you look for when you	2693	B
uh-huh	2693	B
do you normally when you're traveling do you look for places that's established that that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places	2693	B
yeah like a chain restaurant or something	2693	B
um-hum	2693	B
as opposed to like a cafeteria kind of	2693	B
situation yeah	2693	B
well no i don't think so i think it's just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole	2693	B
i guess because we don't go out that much i feel like it's a treat	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
uh-huh	2693	B
oh light menu you mean like cooked light or	2693	B
oh i see uh-huh	2693	B
not a lot of gravy and things like that you know i i like those too i like those too because uh some seems like sometimes it's	2693	B
you order a meal you order their dinner meal and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat or or	2693	B
or or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain and maybe they're afraid that people are going to complain or something i	2693	B
uh-huh	2693	B
and i think that's a shame i mean i must admit sometimes i do like a buffet but uh but i think that they just tend to make you you say oh well i've have got all i can eat or or you know it's one of these situations where	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
well at least it's fruit and stuff there maybe it's not too bad	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
just for food it does seem like it	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
but uh we like uh we do like international food so we tend to i like cooking- we like Indian food and uh i love Italian food and	2693	B
uh Chinese uh	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
yeah	2693	B
yeah that's one thing that i wish we had more of uh because where we're from it's it's pretty limited and it's most of the restaurants are	2693	B
oh they tend to be you know American style food and we don't have too many where- you have to go all the way to Dallas	2693	B
and so really is a treat because uh you know we don't make a trip sixty five eighty you know sixty five to eighty miles depending how far in Dallas it is	2693	B
all right you want to start out	2693	A
oh are you really	2693	A
oh	2693	A
are you strict vegetarians	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
there's very few places that you i'll bet that you could uh	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
yeah and you wouldn't have the meat products in that and some	2693	A
yeah	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
yeah-	2693	A
uh-huh how long have you been doing this	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
do you feel that it has improved the way you feel	2693	A
you think	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum i always thought it would be be hard to figure out what to eat if you were a vegetarian how how	2693	A
yeah	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
because you don't eat any of those things	2693	A
is that right	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
we throw more of it off our body- out other words	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
all that's in it	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
why	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
that's interesting	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
after you have been on this	2693	A
yeah-	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
he thinks more about them then	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum so you kind of have a combination	2693	A
uh-huh now see we i live in a farming community	2693	A
so of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum oh yeah yeah	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
you get adjusted to the taste	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most	2693	A
most people would	2693	A
now we wouldn't have that problem because we're not vegetarians	2693	A
uh i think the main thing that i look for is uh cleanliness	2693	A
uh you know the in the appearance of the people that work there and the uh quality of the food that they serve	2693	A
if	2693	A
oh we try new places but when we a lot of times we do eat where we know	2693	A
what	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
what the quality because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop	2693	A
and uh we do do that a lot	2693	A
and i guess i'm getting old older also i like to be served i like to sit down and have my uh	2693	A
order taken	2693	A
right	2693	A
so i suppose you'd say i well i i don't know whether it's age or what it is but i have	2693	A
yeah yeah	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
you should feel have a treat and i like the light meals not all restaurants have light meals on their menu	2693	A
you know and i	2693	A
uh L I T E like uh uh things that aren't as heavy a meal	2693	A
it	2693	A
that you get more uh fruit and	2693	A
maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as uh	2693	A
they're not breaded and they're not fried and they're not	2693	A
yeah uh but not all restaurants-	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
i know it's too much yes	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
i don't know what it is but	2693	A
now for instance we we had a Scout dinner last night we went to and it's it's they	2693	A
uh well they'll serve you at your seat and usually- usually the salad bar is included so you have to get up for that but	2693	A
they have so much food	2693	A
that you not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself you end up eating	2693	A
much more than you need	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
um-hum uh-huh	2693	A
yeah you can eat as much as you want and you like the food you know	2693	A
i don't know that- you- i know i always overeat no matter i go with good intentions	2693	A
but i somehow along the way when i come back to my seat i have too much and i eat it because it's so good	2693	A
yeah	2693	A
and i like reasonable prices of course too i don't like to	2693	A
you know go to anything that's real expensive	2693	A
i think that's a waste of my money	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
so	2693	A
do you	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
uh-huh	2693	A
Chinese	2693	A
we've got a good Chinese restaurant in town i i really like eating there and	2693	A
and you don't get stuffed on their food it seems	2693	A
you know you can eat a whole big plate of their food and	2693	A
you really don't feel like you've eaten too much	2693	A
you're full you know you're satisfied	2693	A
but you don't feel stuffed and miserable	2693	A
um-hum	2693	A
um	2693	A
so yeah	2693	A
yeah	2693	A
well thanks for being home uh on the weekend i uh i'm actually working at night and uh	2614	A
there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights	2614	A
are are you part of the school system out there	2614	A
uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever	2614	A
oh is that right- great great	2614	A
oh is that right that's wonderful	2614	A
oh yeah i talked to one we're not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh	2614	A
and i i'm of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh uh sell like gang books busters- busters really	2614	A
okay you first on the subject what- what do you think about Latin America	2614	A
Latin America yeah	2614	A
oh really	2614	A
TI had a place i'm not to sure i don't think they do anymore down i think it was Campinas i'm not sure and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few	2614	A
locations not quite a few several in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in in Brazil is closed but i	2614	A
i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh	2614	A
and some people say go to New York but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad	2614	A
uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh i'm kind of like you i don't have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any we have more	2614	A
i guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America i don't really know why though	2614	A
right	2614	A
right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about	2614	A
the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans they would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know and i guess that's true we don't think of	2614	A
any one else but ourselves- i guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of America anyway we think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too	2614	A
as Mexicans yes that that	2614	A
no no i know	2614	A
yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they they we always say we're Americans and they they want us to say we're the North Americans we're not Americans we're North Americans and they're South Americans yeah	2614	A
whatever i i don't want to make i read it somewhere though it's not my point i guess	2614	A
no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an and they they blew all that and borrowed enough- more money than they can pay back now and uh	2614	A
uh so they're not exactly business men i do think we should deal more with them i don't i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish	2614	A
i'm relative relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps	2614	A
when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow	2614	A
uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this	2614	A
i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens	2614	A
you probably don't see that where we see it you know once a month i'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that	2614	A
okay well you see it saw it out there then too	2614	A
uh-huh	2614	A
yeah	2614	A
i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could	2614	A
uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of it's poverty whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that's another story but uh uh it is sad there there's so much down in all of South America	2614	A
uh so much potential you know we're TI of course is is really pushing world markets in their products and they're they're mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced	2614	A
building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything	2614	A
there's got to be trade i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other	2614	A
and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business between us	2614	A
they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there	2614	A
what are what are you taking in school i didn't ask you that	2614	A
what are you taking in school	2614	A
oh you you're an instructor yeah you're an instructor yeah you said	2614	A
that's great	2614	A
are you teaching Computer Science what- you said what were you saying you were teaching there	2614	A
great great	2614	A
right	2614	A
i of course i work at TI and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough i mean i'm i'm i'm getting a kick out of the whole program but uh	2614	A
there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be	2614	A
listening to them or analyzing i guess- they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how	2614	A
uh-huh	2614	A
right	2614	A
oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people uh	2614	A
i'm sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's that's not obviously that's not me you know	2614	A
but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way	2614	A
uh	2614	A
go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten it with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard	2614	A
you'll be able to just give it commands and i'm sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people	2614	A
uh-huh yeah well sometimes i'm home and sometimes i'm not but if i am it's always fun to talk	2614	B
i am as a matter of fact i'm at uh North Carolina State	2614	B
yeah i think i was the one who did that actually	2614	B
yeah i had a uh i teach a course in Voice I O Systems	2614	B
so i know uh you know i know about this project so i got my students to sign up and uh apparently a number of them have been participating	2614	B
uh-huh	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
uh let's see the subject is Latin America	2614	B
i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually was- was planning a trip to Latin America and i got warned off by	2614	B
some people they say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
yeah i i don't understand it either although i i think a lot of South Americans	2614	B
regard the United States as as bullying and uh that's certainly from a historical point of view	2614	B
would be true i mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors	2614	B
yeah well i think they're going to have that's a tough row for them to to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard	2614	B
uh citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans and they can stand on their heads if they want too but i don't think that they're going they're going to change that and	2614	B
and and really i mean North Americans i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of Americans and Canadians i just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans although i guess strictly speaking they are	2614	B
oh i see	2614	B
i don't know	2614	B
yeah well it's it's so interesting i just- i just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
well i grew up in Los Angeles	2614	B
and uh in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student so i i knew uh	2614	B
the Hispanic part of LA pretty well	2614	B
and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that	2614	B
and uh	2614	B
it was	2614	B
it was pretty wild	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
i'm sorry	2614	B
well i am actually	2614	B
yeah i'm the	2614	B
i'm the teacher i give	2614	B
as it were	2614	B
yeah i'm in Computer Science	2614	B
and uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of	2614	B
of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like	2614	B
yeah well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have uh they have a speech signal and what and what is said	2614	B
and they have a they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and that's uh a big problem in speech recognition	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
yeah	2614	B
right	2614	B
well i've been sort of out of it for a little while so i don't know really what's going on	2612	A
yeah all the Democrats trying to show that yeah oh oh gosh we really did support it i mean just because we wanted to impeach him doesn't mean anything	2612	A
yeah there's been uh same thing locally here a couple of uh we got a Senator who uh	2612	A
went on national TV and said that you know if Bush tried to do anything over there without Congressional approval they should impeach him and	2612	A
then	2612	A
yeah yeah	2612	A
sure	2612	A
no uh i don't know i i i usually don't talk politics with people especially strangers because_1 it's a good way to get into an argument but	2612	A
but uh i i don't know i'm i've been Republican for as long as i can remember and the Democrats are just so disorganized and they have been	2612	A
yeah they uh	2612	A
yeah i i don't know it	2612	A
right around the turn of uh oh gosh i should say the eighties now	2612	A
it's already the nineties i forgot i forget that too	2612	A
they they just haven't seemed to been able to hit anything	2612	A
uh on the head	2612	A
every- every time they go one way the wind is always blowing the other which is	2612	A
yeah	2612	A
yeah no i don't i don't know how they're going uh i i you know i'm looking- i'm looking at the upcoming elections and i'm trying to think who are they going to put up	2612	A
oh Tsongas	2612	A
yeah i wouldn't mind him too much he's a pretty good guy he's been around and he's he keeps a low profile and doesn't go after the the headlines and stuff	2612	A
uh	2612	A
yeah	2612	A
yeah i i would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time i i	2612	A
yeah i mean if out- out of all the Democrats that i could think to run i would- he is one that i would i would definitely like to see	2612	A
well i'll tell you if they if they do it like they did uh	2612	A
you know um i mean let's face Dukakis and Bentsen- and Bentsen	2612	A
good grief surely they could have done better than that course they they had a they had themselves between a rock and a hard place they had on the one hand they had Jesse Jackson with all that support	2612	A
and on the other they knew very-	2612	A
oh sure and and they could not give him the nomination	2612	A
uh i	2612	A
yeah	2612	A
um-hum	2612	A
yeah	2612	A
i mean i mean they were really stuck because_1 here they were everybody was expecting Jesse- Jesse to get at least the VP nomination	2612	A
uh certainly not presidential but but quite possibly VP	2612	A
and here they are they they know very well they can't do it because if they do it's going to split the party	2612	A
and if they do it they're going to alienate a whole bunch of others	2612	A
so i mean they were stuck one way or the other yeah it was an interesting thing i was laughing through the whole thing uh	2612	A
yeah i it it it was- it was it was comical i i sat there and watched the just watched CNN and just giggle all night you know uh oh this is great George Bush is in	2612	A
and i think Bush has turned out to be a lot better President than people gave him credit for	2612	A
yeah he is he	2612	A
yeah he he is	2612	A
yeah and- and i i wonder the- you know if if that's i mean that- that really- that really should be all we need in a president someone who is capable of managing	2612	A
and that's all a president is anyway just a manager	2612	A
uh	2612	A
and set the agenda and	2612	A
yeah well you know the Republicans- Republicans have always been weak on on the domestic side they're they're very big on international stuff but domestically they they just say well it'll take care of itself	2612	A
but it's	2612	A
yeah	2612	A
well you know same old you know take it with a grain of salt stuff you know he he	2612	A
yeah yeah and they still do he	2612	A
um-hum	2612	A
um-hum	2612	A
yeah	2612	A
yeah well you know the interesting thing about i don't know if you've been watching Massachusetts lately um	2612	A
oh it's a disaster it's a disaster and the thing was it was all quick fixes finger in the dike sort of thing to make him look good for the upcoming race	2612	A
well i mean that that's what you can infer from it because it it's amazing that it started about two years before the the the run	2612	A
and then you know it took a few years to crap out but i mean it was dying last year i lived up in Boston	2612	A
and i mean it was terrible it was absolutely terrible	2612	A
up- prices are just unbelievable up there	2612	A
and the services are getting terrible everything's going down the tubes	2612	A
said he was going to clean up Boston Harbor and it's dirtier than it ever was	2612	A
never-	2612	A
yeah and then on the other hand too while he was out busy running for the presidential thing the legislature was having their own way	2612	A
and uh you know it was just- it was a pure disaster because_1 the way it was set up	2612	A
he's the one that that put it together and he's the only one who knew how it worked or supposedly worked	2612	A
and he wasn't there to run it	2612	A
and so here's a bunch of legislatures with their own agenda uh legislators with their own agenda	2612	A
and of course the thing just fell apart- fell to pieces and he couldn't do anything with it	2612	A
it was amazing they had a poll last year about i guess it was around July	2612	A
uh	2612	A
they showed the picture of Dukakis	2612	A
to people in Massachusetts only twenty three percent could recognize him as governor	2612	A
it it was-	2612	A
i wish they would	2612	A
yeah i	2612	A
yeah	2612	A
boy i tell you	2612	A
he i'll tell you what you know when i was in the Air Force i met i met Collin Powell	2612	A
yeah i was i had a pretty neat job i got to meet all the big wigs used to fly with the president and all that stuff	2612	A
um Collin Powell is one capable guy	2612	A
he	2612	A
oh yes absolutely i i mean the	2612	A
i know i and i i'll tell you you know it	2612	A
i i my- my degree was in political science because i enjoyed it	2612	A
and i had a good time during that during that election but it floored me when he came up with Quayle	2612	A
because there are so many other capable Republicans	2612	A
i mean	2612	A
yeah and- i mean certainly he wasn't going to take Bob Dole on and not that Bob Dole would even take the position i mean he'd be giving up more than he'd gain	2612	A
but there are several people who are who are just super capable	2612	A
but to get this nobody with the kind of baggage that he's carrying	2612	A
i uh it just astounded me i mean he must have been so sure of winning that it didn't make any difference	2612	A
yeah i well	2612	A
yeah i yeah about that time i think it was neck and neck and i the only the only reason at the time that i could think of was that he was young and and sort of charismatic in uh in uh handsome sort of way	2612	A
and hoping to bring in maybe a little bit of like Kennedy charisma or something	2612	A
but the guy is so uncharismatic	2612	A
i mean	2612	A
i mean Bush talks about he doesn't like broccoli well that's how- how i think of Dan Quayle as broccoli you know	2612	A
well there there's been some interesting stuff going on locally but i suppose nationally the big thing is probably uh the	2612	B
reaction to the war in the Gulf	2612	B
trying to cover themselves	2612	B
yeah	2612	B
yeah that's true there there's a lot of talk over there that- i don't think anyone imagined that it could possibly be as as successful and and painless as it had been	2612	B
so they figured a little bit of opposition was safe but it didn't turn out that way	2612	B
well that's why that's why being strangers is safe we can	2612	B
that's true that's true	2612	B
that's true i i've been Democrat for since i've been voting which isn't that long but i'll agree with you there that there's not much organization going on	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
well that's true but i suppose it's hard to judge from the eighties because um Reagan was just so overwhelming to them i think they're seeing some of that unraveling these days but	2612	B
well they've already got uh oh jeez	2612	B
there's- there's- there's already one candidate that i know of on the Democratic end and i keep thinking there's a second one uh Paul Tsongas	2612	B
yeah uh out of Massachusetts i think	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
i've i've i've heard the name but that that's the extent of my my information about him	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
try to get the conservative candidate for once	2612	B
that that would be interesting i i must admit i haven't been really enthusiastic about the Democratic entrants	2612	B
in the last couple of run throughs	2612	B
but completely unelectable and	2612	B
true it's it's probably their- their their troubles probably stem from the fact that they're such a diverse party	2612	B
and the nominating rules these days are so um pseudo democratic i guess	2612	B
you can't have the people in the back rooms deciding well who could we really get elected instead there's so much	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
true i suppose being on the other side of the aisle it probably made good comic theater	2612	B
yeah that's true that's true	2612	B
i i must admit i'm i'm still- i i still find him a little uninspiring he he seems like a reasonably competent	2612	B
person to sort of	2612	B
do do some caretaking to um	2612	B
true	2612	B
sort of set the agenda and and let let people do the work it's it's unfortunate how how little domestic agenda he	2612	B
he- he worries about	2612	B
true but uh so many of his campaign promises were on the the domestic promises	2612	B
true	2612	B
that that's that's what just amazes me though is that that so many people do uh take the campaign promises seriously	2612	B
well the the one thing that just amazed me in in Texas here there were a series of um ads	2612	B
saying don't vote for Dukakis he's going to take away your right to own a gun he's going to close down defense plants he's going to do this he's going to do that	2612	B
half of which is coming true	2612	B
and i just- here's my chance to giggle boy it's a good thing we didn't elect that Dukakis guy because i mean-	2612	B
i know- i know that the the Massachusetts miracle has has gone bust	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
oh i i guess i didn't hear that i didn't go over it really	2612	B
true true i suppose	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
yeah that really is disappointing it's it's sort of	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
that's incredible oh oh there's- there's one thing i've got to ask you about the the dump Quayle movement i find that interesting	2612	B
i i find him such an embarrassment and uh i mean the the- the idea of Collin Powell well he's so powerful- or he's so popular now	2612	B
i i i don't know if he's the the right one to replace him he'd probably be a perfectly competent replacement but	2612	B
really	2612	B
i get- i i i would probably find him an order of magnitude more capable than Quayle	2612	B
it's it's interesting to hear that Bush has	2612	B
instead- instead- instead- instead of just making bland uh pronouncements about having no plans to change the ticket has just really emphatically come out and said no way	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
well from from some of the things i've heard about Bush he he he didn't want a vice president that was any competition for him	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
well it uh uh i'm i guess i'm the i'm cloudy on the timing but there there was quite a while when his certain victory wasn't certain at all	2612	B
i'm i'm not sure how that timing related to the Quayle announcement but he was trailing at at times	2612	B
or or just- just neck and neck i guess	2612	B
um-hum	2612	B
oh that brings up another subject it's the the the	2612	B
uh i don't know the	2612	B
um one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education because_1 i went through the public um school system of Boston and uh	2632	A
i always felt	2632	A
that i graduated high school and i still didn't even i- i- i couldn't put together a map of the United States	2632	A
you know what i mean and yet i felt that i got a good education and- and i did well in school but you tell me to name you know	2632	A
five continents and i couldn't do it i just feel like there are some real basics that are missing from education	2632	A
and that people are are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things	2632	A
um-hum	2632	A
yeah	2632	A
um-hum	2632	A
right	2632	A
yeah	2632	A
um did you go through a a public school system or a private	2632	A
um-hum did you notice a big difference	2632	A
like in what sense	2632	A
um-hum	2632	A
um-hum	2632	A
yeah	2632	A
i work in a temporary agency and there are people that come in you know everyday to fill out an application and	2632	A
they'll have to bring somebody with them and they will show that they completed um four years of high school yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application	2632	A
they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves	2632	A
it's just incredible	2632	A
really	2632	A
yeah	2632	A
i know um they uh i forget what- i think it's um	2632	A
someplace in New York	2632	A
because they're having budget problems they're closing the libraries	2632	A
i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports	2632	A
or anything like that they're not cutting in any other corner they're closing the libraries that to me shows a little uh switch in priorities you know	2632	A
so do you go to college right now are you in-	2632	A
you're so you're a senior now	2632	A
oh good for you that's great um is is NC University is that uh uh state what'd you say	2632	A
NC State that's a state university then i see and you're from there also	2632	A
um-hum i see	2632	A
well pretty soon it's gonna get to the point where no one's gonna be able to afford to send their kids to college or to go to college	2632	A
it's just outrageously expensive	2632	A
oh is it well still though i mean you know thousands of dollars	2632	A
oh well that's good that's good i went to a private university and um	2632	A
i- i don't know i look back now and i i think that i probably would've done it differently if i um you know could do it over again but um	2632	A
i- i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or	2632	A
didn't even go to school some some of them and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did	2632	A
i really do and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say but um i don't know i i- what	2632	A
i went to Brandeis University it's in Massachusetts	2632	A
and um	2632	A
i- i really felt like i've been working now for about four years	2632	A
and i i feel like what- what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable than what i learned in school	2632	A
and i know that i'm drawing a lot on what i learned in school you know i i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on -learned but um	2632	A
i don't know my sister's a principal at a school and one thing that she's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing-	2632	A
um are just some the golden rules she calls them just some basics about um you know you don't take what's not yours	2632	A
uh and and if you want to you know you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission like no hitting you know no pulling hair or anything like that	2632	A
and uh the school that she's in is a um it's basically for minorities um there's uh a large minority population and um	2632	A
she's really noticed that	2632	A
even some of the teachers that work there i think they don't value that type of student as much as you get in some	2632	A
yeah it's true um-hum	2632	A
and i don't know if it makes them feel better i mean do teachers get i- mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking somebody that wasn't as successful	2632	A
and seeing what they could do versus somebody that you know did excel in in areas and just watching them get better you know that's not much of a challenge	2632	A
but	2632	A
are do you have any idea what you're gonna go into when you graduate	2632	A
oh yeah	2632	A
do you know where you're going	2632	A
where's that	2632	A
oh is that North Carolina oh okay	2632	A
no i don't know that area	2632	A
i don't know it	2632	A
i don't get down there very often	2632	A
oh really well the way i pick the final four was um by the the state that had the warmest climate	2632	A
so that's how i chose all mine so you can tell that i didn't really have	2632	A
that much to do with any of it	2632	A
but so obviously you're into education if you can be going my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now	2632	A
and uh i don't know i give you a lot of credit i- i couldn't do it i i couldn't wait to graduate and have it be all over	2632	A
i know	2632	A
yeah i kind of know what you mean	2632	A
well it was really nice talking to you okay good luck {alrighty} take care bye-bye	2632	A
all right	2632	B
uh-huh	2632	B
hm uh-huh	2632	B
uh-huh	2632	B
huh	2632	B
yeah when uh well talking about public education um	2632	B
i was just- just- i'm we're doing a proposal at we're doing at NC State	2632	B
we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum	2632	B
so that's kind of at a higher level	2632	B
so it's interesting that you chose that topic	2632	B
yeah well i went through private until ninth grade	2632	B
yeah	2632	B
oh yeah big difference	2632	B
well um	2632	B
in uh public schools i guess	2632	B
there were- there are a lot of you know people can take lower level courses and get away with learning nothing	2632	B
but um in private school you couldn't do that you know you had to learn	2632	B
uh-huh	2632	B
huh	2632	B
it's bad	2632	B
yeah our state just cut a whole bunch of uh like	2632	B
think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget	2632	B
so we're making all kinds of cuts in college	2632	B
people cannot i mean the teachers can't make tests anymore and the the library's canceling all it's subscription	2632	B
it's pretty sorry	2632	B
uh-huh	2632	B
yeah	2632	B
huh	2632	B
and uh	2632	B
yeah	2632	B
yeah it's my last year	2632	B

yeah	2632	B
yeah	2632	B
yeah that's true	2632	B
um graduate school yeah	2632	B
i think i'm going to Chapel Hill	2632	B

overloaded	2632	B
all right	2632	B
all right thank you	2632	B
all right bye	2632	B
okay the i guess the latest one that we've seen is uh Awakening with uh yeah that's with uh uh	2695	B
oh the guy that plays Mark uh Robin Williams and he played a terrific part in that	2695	B
but uh that's one of the better ones we've seen in in the last oh i guess the last six months	2695	B
Flatliners i want- i never did get to see that	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
this uh Awakening i think is is something along the same lines	2695	B
it's uh about a doctor uh and it's a true story	2695	B
uh there was a bunch of people that were uh they first of all they they thought they had Parkinson- Parkinson's disease	2695	B
they would tremble- first start trembling real bad but then they would just go- almost go into a coma	2695	B
and uh	2695	B
they they could tell that they were responding- that they could hear you	2695	B
but it was just a blank stare you got and they were just almost frozen	2695	B
in in in a position	2695	B
and they tried some uh	2695	B
tried some drugs and then all of a sudden that one summer uh the drug that they gave them brought them out of their coma and that's where they got the word awakening	2695	B
but then they lapsed back into the coma	2695	B
but uh	2695	B
and Robert DeNiro played the uh played i guess uh the co-lead part he was one of the ones that were in a coma	2695	B
oh it's been out i guess now for	2695	B
or a month and a half or something like that	2695	B
but if you get a chance see that i also want to see uh that uh Sleeping With The Enemy- or Silence of the Lambs	2695	B
i've heard that that's good	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
yeah well i heard it's not really that that uh gross it's not like Friday the 13th or something like that	2695	B
yeah yeah	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
yeah but they they're trying to experience uh life after death	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
we don't see as many movies as we used to	2695	B
uh we got a VCR so we go to Blockbuster	2695	B
video place and rent the movies	2695	B
huh-uh	2695	B
yeah there was another good movie that Robin Williams played in uh that really surprised me it was uh Dead Poets Society	2695	B
uh	2695	B
but it	2695	B
uh it's not typical Robin Williams i you know i expected some comedy or something like that but he he's a good dramatic actor- actor when he wants to be	2695	B
uh that Awakening i guess is the last movie we've been to in a couple months like i say we we uh our son one of our sons gave us for Christmas some Blockbuster uh gift certificates	2695	B
and uh	2695	B
we just go up and find some old movies that we haven't seen	2695	B
uh	2695	B
some of the old classics	2695	B
uh some some some of the like the uh Agatha- Agatha Christie uh movies Murder On Orient Express and some of the others	2695	B
course the new releases they're i don't know what the rule is now but i think they had	2695	B
i don't know if it's a year or what before they put them_1 on uh VCR so you can rent them_1 yeah	2695	B
yeah but there's a couple out that i would- i'd like to see i want to see that Silence of the Lambs i want to see uh uh Sleeping With the Enemy	2695	B
and uh i can't remember some of the others	2695	B
oh we went and rented uh Field of Dreams	2695	B
have you seen that one yeah that was good	2695	B
Kevin Costner	2695	B
but uh yeah i like nature movies too i like used to be uh Walt Disney would put out what they called True Life Adventures	2695	B
yeah i saw The Bear that was good	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
but some of the old ones that he put out like uh The Living Desert	2695	B
and uh oh there were several i can't remember them_1 all but he would the show the animals and everything that live in a particular region or whatever	2695	B
i remember he done one on the desert and he done one on the prairie	2695	B
uh	2695	B
but i- i like True Life Adventures	2695	B
hm	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
i'm not i'm not much for the for the gory Friday The 13ths and	2695	B
and Nightmare On Elm Street and all that other stuff uh	2695	B
now i do like a good mystery you know like Psycho or something like that but not the gory where they just all they show is blood and guts	2695	B
i never did see that uh one that won uh so many Academy Awards that uh	2695	B
the one Kevin Costner- Costner directed and starred in	2695	B
um	2695	B
about the Indian uh Dance With Wolves or something like that	2695	B
i didn't see that i've heard some people say it's good and some people say it's they didn't like it course i guess you you can get that on any kind of movie you see	2695	B
yeah i heard it's over three hours long	2695	B
but uh	2695	B
plus movies cost so much now unless you go to the early movie	2695	B
down here i don't know what costs you up there but down here man and wife you're going to spend	2695	B
if you for your tickets and any popcorn and cold drink you're going to spend close to fifteen dollars	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
and that they're awfully small too	2695	B
and uh it used to be the candy counter and stuff would have the small bars but now all they have is the big old family size bars	2695	B
so	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
where where are you attending school	2695	B
NC State	2695	B
how'd y'all do in basketball this year	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
y'all usually always have a good basketball	2695	B
hum	2695	B
yeah well this is football country down here	2695	B
although Arkansas had a pretty good basketball team	2695	B
but uh	2695	B
well	2695	B
i was trying to think of something else i- i do miss uh i'm i'm fifty seven years old and you don't sound like you're that old	2695	B
but uh i remember when i was a kid kid and you'd go to the movies and you got to see a movie and usually a double feature	2695	B
you got to see a newsreel	2695	B
and usually a serial like Flash Gordon or or uh Zorro or something like that line	2695	B
and then a cartoon	2695	B
at least one cartoon sometimes two cartoons	2695	B
and you could spend almost all afternoon at the movie just watching movies and	2695	B
other stuff but now it it's the movie and the previews and that's about it	2695	B
and the ads	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
but a lot of times we would go to the movies just to see the cartoons and the serial	2695	B
because_1 you always wondered	2695	B
how can the guy get out of this	2695	B
and then the next yeah cliffhangers and the next week you'd find out how he got out of it	2695	B
yeah	2695	B
but uh	2695	B
well i enjoyed talking with you	2695	B
and good luck in your schooling	2695	B
okay have a good day bye-bye	2695	B
Awakening	2695	A
i haven't heard of that one	2695	A
uh-huh	2695	A
huh	2695	A
yeah we just saw uh Flatliners last night that was really good	2695	A

yeah	2695	A
uh-huh	2695	A
uh-huh	2695	A

yeah if you don't you don't mind the the gross parts of it	2695	A
yeah	2695	A
uh-huh	2695	A
oh yeah	2695	A
just the subtle kind of stuff though	2695	A
yeah	2695	A
it uh Flatliners is a real good movie too i recommend renting that	2695	A
it's got some uh interesting things about it because_1 you know you know what the plot is basically that they kill themselves and come back	2695	A
yeah then when they come back all sorts of strange things start happening to them_1	2695	A
um-hum	2695	A
yeah that's what i- i just did today i got uh Darkman have you seen that uh i haven't i'll guess i'll watch it tonight	2695	A

yeah it was okay	2695	A
i'm not much into baseball	2695	A

yeah	2695	A
um-hum	2695	A
a long movie though	2695	A
yeah that's true	2695	A
that's about what it is here too	2695	A
those three dollar drinks three dollar popcorn	2695	A
yeah	2695	A
oh yeah	2695	A
yeah i just got some free passes for movies because_1 i'm graduating	2695	A
so i can use those	2695	A
NC State	2695	A
yeah graduating Computer Science	2695	A
oh we did pretty good	2695	A
oh	2695	A
yeah next year we're not going to have anybody though because all our seniors are leaving	2695	A
yeah	2695	A
uh-huh yeah as always	2695	A
well	2695	A
uh-huh	2695	A
no	2695	A
twenty two	2695	A
um-hum	2695	A
um-hum	2695	A
um-hum	2695	A
yeah	2695	A
and the ads	2695	A
throw a Coke ad in there	2695	A
um-hum	2695	A
cliffhanger	2695	A
and into something else	2695	A
okay	2695	A
all right	2695	A
yeah	2695	A
bye all right bye	2695	A
okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war um the war that just went on see i don't agree with it first of all i don't believe in war	2616	A
and then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for	2616	A
keeping us our freedom and stuff like that and i think it's all independent because it's it has nothing to do with the United States you didn't gain anything from it	2616	A
and it wasn't our freedom that you were saving it was just	2616	A
the thing the thing that that uh that i saw was okay Iraq wants to raise oil prices Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent	2616	A
and so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea	2616	A
right then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up and like for example see okay like Lithuania- Lithuania right they declared themselves uh an independent country with a president right	2616	A
Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there and they kick everybody's ass	2616	A
and the United States doesn't go in there and say listen they were uh you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country	2616	A
but these countries here which you know are you know like in nineteen eighty four have you ever read that book	2616	A
okay nineteen eighty four there are like three big continents and uh there's just this area like around Egypt and stuff that everybody's fighting over now the problem is is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries	2616	A
right like their immediate boundaries like you're not going to go you know it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're you're invading their border right but all the other countries you can fight about	2616	A
and so the thing is is that you're wasting so much money to send you know it's like how much money did the US spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being	2616	A
and you know it's it was uh basically all based on oil because nobody actually like for example if uh let's say if uh you know Brazil took over you know Surinam i don't think anybody would care	2616	A
you know and uh	2616	A
that's something that that has been you know very because see the thing is is like every time that i see a war i see myself on the front line	2616	A
and on the other side i see myself again and i got to shoot myself you know i got to shoot somebody that's- -that's got the same family that i do you know the same relationships that i do and just because i was born here i've got to shoot them_1 down	2616	A
and uh but at least it was it was over quick and there weren't that many deaths now the only problem is is the aftermath that you're having so many deaths in the border with uh Turkey	2616	A
and uh	2616	A
well	2616	A
there's- there's something that that the US did right which is say say you know okay let's kick him out of Kuwait	2616	A
which was our basic goal	2616	A
and uh now indirectly let's try to overthrow him	2616	A
you know and they're not going to do that directly	2616	A
but the thing is is that they they didn't go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country you know you can seek seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again	2616	A
well the thing is is that first of all they got to they got- they have to get him	2616	A
and and there's no way that you can get him unless it's by force	2616	A
you know and then you can put him on trial	2616	A
no no i think i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's i mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where	2616	A
you know and so um the thing is is that once you've done something wrong which is nationally- you know internationally recognized	2616	A
then you're going to try to get out of it and the there's no way you know and especially since he's got inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff	2616	A
and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh that- that were on their way to Turkey	2616	A
he had a couple of them bombarded	2616	A
um-hum	2616	A
but uh	2616	A
you know he's got uh	2616	A
millions of dollars like	2616	A
fifty- i think it was like i don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really doesn't make any difference	2616	A
yeah	2616	A
and	2616	A
but it's just it's just that uh you know it- you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know it's like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately	2616	A
but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down when they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something	2616	A
well the- it it's an advantage you know it's like you're saying okay i can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon	2616	A
and i'm not going to bring them_1 back down to you know ninety nine cents why because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon	2616	A
so if i ten- leave it at a dollar ten people are still going to pay	2616	A
you know i went down forty cents but i went up ten cents	2616	A
you know	2616	A
ninety eight	2616	A
oh God	2616	A
here it's like it's like a dollar five yeah	2616	A
but still the i mean have you ever checked like uh the most money makers in uh in nineteen uh ninety	2616	A
uh you can see that uh Exxon and Amaco and uh other companies oh God i forgot their names but uh Exxon was the number one money maker and that was just because of- of the last quarter	2616	A
yeah	2616	A
and uh that was i mean and one of the companies uh went up four hundred and some percent	2616	A
and that's practically impossible to do now a days for a company to to shoot up in that way and uh	2616	A
it's just that you know people	2616	A
people take advantage- take advantage of that you know like the the companies were saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices	2616	A
you know but still if you realize that uh one barrel has like how much was it like uh	2616	A
forty gallons	2616	A
something it's got forty gallons and they're selling you know	2616	A
you- you know you- you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon and it's it was selling like at twenty five or something	2616	A
so you're making uh you know fifteen dollars profit easily	2616	A
and uh everything i mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like uh you know it's like who's gaining on this okay because uh i uh does does the US government own any gas companies like like you know like gas stations and stuff	2616	A
i because see like for example	2616	A
i don't know if the British government owns Shell i'm not sure about that	2616	A
but the thing is like the US government got nothing out of it	2616	A
because well you know it's like other- the other independent companies the gas stations you know and they did	2616	A
and uh then the taxes go up and then everybody else loses	2616	A
but um you know they're just	2616	A
they're just some things that might not be worth it	2616	A
you know and and uh first of all how many how many people had to had to die before the war you know it's like transporting stuff and	2616	A
things like that before you know it's like yeah sure you know like to to a couple people that died there their families don't feel it was necessary to do that yeah yeah you you could never you could never bring them_1 back so oh well	2616	A
yeah so okay nice talking to you	2616	A
bye-bye	2616	A
okay	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
no huh-uh	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
we'll probably never know how much it actually cost	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yep	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
oh it's never a pleasant thing that's true	2616	B
yes	2616	B
that's amazing	2616	B
yes	2616	B
yes that's really unfortunate it really is i don't know if we stopped too soon i don't i don't i really don't know what we need to do about that	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yeah	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
i've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on you know criminal charges i don't know if that will ever happen or not	2616	B
uh-huh which is very difficult to do	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
obviously he's not going to turn himself in	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
true	2616	B
yeah	2616	B
yeah true	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yeah yeah obviously human life means nothing to him	2616	B
oh yeah	2616	B
that's true past a point it doesn't make any difference	2616	B
yeah that's really really unfortunate it really is	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yep	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally though before the before the increase started	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
true	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yep	2616	B
about the lowest i've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is uh i guess about ninety two point nine now	2616	B
ninety two	2616	B
oh really	2616	B
well there's still a lot of dollar five places around here but you can find some that's under a dollar but not not a whole lot that's the lowest i've seen	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
right i think Mobil's doing very well too well i assume- i assume all the major major brands are	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
that's true	2616	B
yeah	2616	B
yeah	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yeah something like- yeah	2616	B
yeah	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yep	2616	B
yep sure	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
i'm not sure either	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
um-hum	2616	B
yeah that's true	2616	B
um-hum yeah	2616	B
sure dead's dead	2616	B
that's true	2616	B
well i don't guess we resolved anything but it's interesting it's	2616	B
to you too take care bye-bye	2616	B
yes	2624	B
well i am very much in favor of closing our door to some extent i'm afraid i've gotten a little bit America first when i get a cab in	2624	B
almost any large city in the United States and the driver barely speaks English	2624	B
uh	2624	B
yes of course it also happened to us in Sidney Australia this Summer uh or last Summer we got a cab and	2624	B
again it was an oriental person	2624	B
and we asked him to take us to the opera house and he did not know what we were talking about	2624	B
so maybe my isolation isn't for our country might be a little bit for the world i don't know but uh	2624	B
i just feel like	2624	B
we are we have accepted people other people from other countries so well to the point that we have not taken care of our own how do you feel about	2624	B
however	2624	B
hm hm um-hum	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
uh	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
um you {betcha}	2624	B
i	2624	B
um	2624	B
however if you were living in Mexico in those conditions would you have several children	2624	B
well	2624	B
but you yourself you yourself would not do that you would not have several children if you couldn't	2624	B
uh	2624	B
yeah but you don't have-	2624	B
that's not my fault	2624	B
i know	2624	B
um	2624	B
uh	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
uh-huh uh	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
uh-huh at one point and i cannot say that it's true now but at one point the city of Chicago was	2624	B
required by federal law to hire teachers who spoke Spanish so that they could teach to the the children there who only spoke Spanish	2624	B
but this is America and our language is English	2624	B
no	2624	B
uh	2624	B
um	2624	B
i think so too	2624	B
yeah	2624	B
huh-uh well it's English-	2624	B
it's encouraging them to not speak English	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
but that's the same thing you're saying about the little Mexican children that you feel sorry for them and you would swim the river twice but i	2624	B
sure but	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
absolutely and and i know what you're saying we do what we have to do for our children regardless- regardless of what that is	2624	B
but i'm a little bit unsympathetic with the families right here in our own small town of five thousand who have not limited their family we have three children and that happens to be what we could afford but	2624	B
i don't really feel like i ought to help even if they're people from Indiana support ten children that's not fair i didn't get a say whether they had them or not so i don't think i ought to have to help raise them maybe i'm um	2624	B
too critical i i'm concerned about world birth control and	2624	B
uh-hum	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
oh isn't that awful i was just reading this thing in the Chicago Tribune yesterday about this little girl who was a crack baby and she was put in a foster home for five years and was having a wonderful life and then her mother	2624	B
claimed to have her self- her act together and she was given back to her birth mother who she had never seen i mean it was just one of those awful things where the Child Protection Service completely broke down	2624	B
and now two years later the court ordered that she be given back to the foster people i it's just awful it's just awful the whole thing	2624	B
it's just awful i i as i say i'm isolationist i think we need to	2624	B
to close our doors to some of the immigration and now they're talking about how we're bound to have an influx of immigrants from the latest war from Iraq Iran	2624	B
Saudi Arabia so on and so forth and uh i'm i'm really sorry that i feel the way i do but i just think that we need to not take people as we have over the many- last many many years	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
yeah	2624	B
because	2624	B
well and	2624	B
and i think probably they have said that if you save these people by feeding them then they reproduce and then you have a later more serious famine yeah	2624	B
yeah	2624	B
yeah	2624	B
um-hum	2624	B
um	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
when our children were all three at home our oldest daughter uh is still a very giving caring wonderful person she's making a career of uh	2624	B
well she's a director at a care center close to here in fact my mother's a resident there anyhow was- uh she got us involved in the Christian Children's Fund	2624	B
and we were sponsoring a young boy in Chattanooga Tennessee in a home then and that went on for oh four or five years and finally we had a letter from the Christian Children's Fund that they were no longer going to	2624	B
uh sponsor children within the continental United States that all of the money would be going to children overseas because	2624	B
for however much money we were sending a month they could buy so much more milk and bread and rice and so on and so forth for children overseas well at	2624	B
yeah well at that point we said no we're not doing this any more we wanted to help somebody here within the continental United States it wasn't our choice to	2624	B
to send and then too i think that money gets watered down in administrative costs when it all goes overseas and i always wonder if people who need it actually get it	2624	B
um	2624	B
um	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
uh-huh	2624	B
it all turns different doesn't it	2624	B
we were on a cruise ship one time and some people from the Methodist Church were talking about how their	2624	B
church diocese had poured thousands of dollars into Haiti and it had been used for Papa Doc's daughter's wedding	2624	B
which i'm sure that's not what they had in mind when they were pouring that money in the	2624	B
the subject is how we feel about immigration	2624	A
would you like to get started or would you like me to	2624	A
um-hum	2624	A
yes	2624	A
that's happened to me too	2624	A
oh my	2624	A
well i have i'm really torn on the subject i'm not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you	2624	A
well the other side i see	2624	A
because we have Mexico as a neighbor	2624	A
and i can tell you right now	2624	A
that if i were living in Mexico	2624	A
and trying to raise several children and i could see across the border where the good life would be for my children	2624	A
would i swim that river every night twice if that's what it took you know i don't care whatever it would take i have real sympathy for those people i really do and you can	2624	A
probably they don't have birth control	2624	A
they have no concept of it it's against their church	2624	A
well but they don't have if you know if i had to put myself in their shoes i have to do it one hundred percent	2624	A
their church doesn't teach birth control they preach against it	2624	A
i understand what you're saying but i'm saying	2624	A
i feel real sympathy for them so i really and and and by the way i feel the same way when i i just got back from Florida	2624	A
and boy i tell you happily- happily i can i can understand just a little bit of Cuban English	2624	A
just a little bit	2624	A
which was about all i wanted to understand	2624	A
uh but i it's amazing because they're they're bilingual	2624	A
everything is is Spanish English in Florida and i didn't particularly enjoy it quite frankly	2624	A
yes	2624	A
that's right and i'm sorry that business	2624	A
of making it mandatory i don't like mandatory anything	2624	A
because it just doesn't work all the time it doesn't fit there are circumstances that are different but i do think if you come to America and you're going to live here and you're going to go to our schools and do all of this speak our language	2624	A
i really do and it's only fair to the children i think making giving the children an out that they don't have to speak English is just encouraging them to drop out later on because they'll never make it through high school	2624	A
and if they do it won't make any difference because there's not a job for them	2624	A
that's exactly right and that is the wrong message	2624	A
i just	2624	A
i don't know i feel so sorry for them but at the same time	2624	A
well i would if it were if they were my kids i would so i have to sympathize with the people that come over here and work and send money back	2624	A
you know it's it's right on the survival level and we do what we do to survive	2624	A
oh i'm i'm that's that's one on me too i mean	2624	A
there are too many children that are just conceived and produced and dropped on society	2624	A
without a thought these crack babies	2624	A
are so sad	2624	A
doesn't make any sense	2624	A
well we had	2624	A
there there's a little background here but it it builds up to what we're talking about our church had a long	2624	A
long	2624	A
discussion group and basically the question started out	2624	A
that as at the time when there were starving people in India i believe	2624	A
and the question was should we save these people	2624	A
and our bottom line answer was no	2624	A
because we cannot save the world	2624	A
we cannot feed the world and we should not please the world	2624	A
this	2624	A
and the other thing	2624	A
is we can feed them today but they'll be hungry tomorrow what'll we do with them tomorrow do we feed them again tomorrow well how long how long can we continue to feed the world we can't do it are they starving to death yes and that's very sad	2624	A
but we cannot save them we- you know okay we can save one	2624	A
and that's good but what's you know	2624	A
-that's just back to what you're saying if you want to save somebody there's plenty in the United States that need it to	2624	A
so they're taking the world viewpoint	2624	A
um-hum	2624	A
but by profession	2624	A
i negotiate for Texas Instruments a lot	2624	A
and i'm somewhat cynical	2624	A
about humans and their behavior	2624	A
because i have had	2624	A
many interesting examples of human behavior	2624	A
when you're talking about money you'd be surprised how human we all get very quickly	2624	A
uh-huh um	2624	A
uh-huh there you go	2624	A
but see that's what happens And the other sad thing i heard about the Kurds	2624	A
do you want to go first	2608	B
well you go ahead	2608	B
oh yeah	2608	B
oh yeah uh-huh	2608	B
oh it sounds fantastic	2608	B
oh yeah uh-huh	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
is it cayenne pepper you mean	2608	B
yes	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
yes	2608	B
and how much shrimp would you use	2608	B
two pounds okay	2608	B
oh yeah	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
okay	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
oh yeah	2608	B
sure	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
a glass dish uh-huh	2608	B
okay uh-huh	2608	B
yeah	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
and it's are you cooking the whole head at one time okay	2608	B
i see	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
yeah	2608	B
oh that sounds fantastic	2608	B
um um	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
sure	2608	B
and it's not much work	2608	B
that sounds	2608	B
yeah really- i bet it tastes good too	2608	B
oh yeah	2608	B
sure	2608	B
now how many could you serve	2608	B
yeah okay- okay i figured about that	2608	B
oh that's good	2608	B
see out here we have so many uh ethnic people we have Italians and we have Portuguese and we have Russians and Polish and	2608	B
it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain	2608	B
you know so it's hard uh you you just have to pick something for the the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time	2608	B
and uh they're big on finger food here too you know chicken wings and uh ribs and that kind of stuff uh barbecue	2608	B
and uh cooking out in the yard it yard- you know when it's nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff	2608	B
uh no but i have had shrimp	2608	B
oh of course that's	2608	B
yeah	2608	B
really is it like shrimp	2608	B
it's similar	2608	B
oh it does	2608	B
does it look like a lobster	2608	B
oh it looks more like a crab oh	2608	B
are they thin long	2608	B
or wide	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
oh yeah yep	2608	B
oh	2608	B
and and where did you say you were from	2608	B
Louisiana oh well do you do cajun cooking	2608	B
oh i love uh blackened you know uh the the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff oh we have a few places up here that do that	2608	B
and if ever i see it on the menu i always get it	2608	B
it is so good	2608	B
now how do they do the blackened	2608	B
but uh do you have to have a certain skillet or something	2608	B
no	2608	B
i did have i don't have it now but i have mostly Teflon	2608	B
you now but uh	2608	B
does- does it have to get extremely hot	2608	B
yeah	2608	B
uh-huh oh oh i see	2608	B
yeah	2608	B
oh i see	2608	B
oh	2608	B
oh	2608	B
oh really	2608	B
oh now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time is that what you're saying	2608	B
oh uh-huh	2608	B
because i could have the uh chicken on the skewers	2608	B
with uh uh blackened seasoning	2608	B
and oh that is so good delicious	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
oh	2608	B
it is i i love it i i in fact i was in Texas for a little while and i liked uh the barbecues and the Mexican food	2608	B
i have a passion for all that type of different tastes because i have been brought up mostly Italian American food because my uh parents are Italian and Portuguese	2608	B
so we cook a lot of pasta and uh gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing that's why i enjoy going to restaurants and have you know trying different things	2608	B
i would love to	2608	B
i	2608	B
really	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
is that right	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
now where where do you go when you go there uh right on Basin Street and those places	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
oh	2608	B
oh i see	2608	B
oh that's nice	2608	B
uh-huh	2608	B
really	2608	B
and don't they make a lot of um i'm trying to think what they call their soup i don't know	2608	B
yeah jumbo gumbo right is is is that with seafood	2608	B
oh you can	2608	B
that looks good too i've seen them do- the chefs on TV do that and oh it looks delicious	2608	B
see we do um uh a thing we call it a sea bake you uh you take clams	2608	B
okay	2608	A
you can go first or i will	2608	A
okay	2608	A
well i'm going to tell you what i'd have	2608	A
down in the South we have a lot of shrimp	2608	A
okay and i have uh shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook	2608	A
and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert	2608	A
yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker	2608	A
and um you place the shrimp in the	2608	A
in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some uh red pepper over it	2608	A
now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some you know regular red peppers	2608	A
cayenne uh-huh	2608	A
and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind	2608	A
then you would only use two of them and you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it	2608	A
two pounds	2608	A
that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up	2608	A
and you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil	2608	A
and the shrimp turn pink then you remove it and you put it on a platter and then you serve it with melted butter and uh	2608	A
i usually put garlic powder in mine	2608	A
and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it	2608	A
but uh then the microwave- uh the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave and what you do is you just uh wash it and you core it	2608	A
and in a like a oh what do you call it like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave	2608	A
uh-huh but it's got to have one that has a cover on it	2608	A
and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt	2608	A
and then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time	2608	A
uh-huh you- uh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off	2608	A
and uh you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time and while that's cooking i take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise	2608	A
and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and i mix it all together and i shred up some just regular white cheese	2608	A
and after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that and you cook it for another three minutes on high	2608	A
you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it and it's done	2608	A
it is good but it it looks i mean what you can do then see is like what i usually do is i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle and then i put the uh shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter	2608	A
and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that	2608	A
and you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then i just fix little individual cups for them and they have the garlic bread and it makes it a real nice looking	2608	A
you know	2608	A
huh-uh huh-uh but it looks like it you know you look like you went to a whole bunch	2608	A
right and uh usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know and i'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that	2608	A
okay uh it usually serves six	2608	A
yeah	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
yeah	2608	A
yeah	2608	A
yeah have you ever had crawfish	2608	A
oh you ought to try some crawfish they are good but see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over	2608	A
you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking	2608	A
you know they want it from down here	2608	A
because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is	2608	A
but	2608	A
uh it's similar uh-huh	2608	A
yeah it's not exactly i mean it's got a taste of its own you know but it is it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it	2608	A
um it looks more like a crab	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
but	2608	A
no	2608	A
um let me think of	2608	A
i can't even think of what you i guess if it uh it looks like more like a cross between uh a crab and uh and a lobster because it's small like that and it's got the pinchers like a crab but	2608	A
but you know it's it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would	2608	A
and we call them mud bugs	2608	A
but i mean they're fantastic tasting they are so good everybody it's it's the season for them right now	2608	A
Louisiana	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
oh yeah	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
yeah	2608	A
yes	2608	A
yeah you know	2608	A
you buy it you buy it as a seasoning	2608	A
huh-uh huh-uh i cook mine well do you have a uh like a black iron skillet	2608	A
oh okay well i guess you could cook it in in that too but i don't know you know i never have i use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine	2608	A
uh-huh but it really it's not it it it doesn't burn or anything like that the blackening is really the seasoning	2608	A
i mean there is it's it's a blackening seasoning	2608	A
you know i mean that is a seasoning that's really it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it	2608	A
because it's called uh	2608	A
what it's called is Blackening Magic and it it comes in a bottle and uh	2608	A
well i'm trying to see it's got a a picture of Dom De Luise on it	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
right	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
but	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
yeah	2608	A
but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean your pan it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in but it's not like it's burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning	2608	A
and it is so good oh	2608	A
yeah	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
well have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana you know to visit	2608	A
yeah you ought to come down um you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans you know if you want to really get some good food	2608	A
i mean you don't have to go that far south	2608	A
but uh	2608	A
of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i'm concerned and fact is we're going to take a vacation this year we're going to go to New Orleans again and uh	2608	A
we're only going down there for the food though	2608	A
uh yeah we go to the the French Quarters and stuff like that and uh i have some friends that live down there	2608	A
and so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones we go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know	2608	A
and we went to this one it was called The Back Porch and uh	2608	A
they were cooking the stuff you know while we were we went on this boat ride and then we came back and ate out on this it was like a back porch	2608	A
and uh usually if you can find somebody of course now when you go down there you know i mean they've got just there's no where you can miss	2608	A
i have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full it's unreal and uh i mean it's so good the seasoning they it's just unreal	2608	A
gumbo	2608	A
no gumbo uh-huh right	2608	A
uh-huh you can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
uh-huh	2608	A
and i'll tell you what	2608	A
uh been through it	2644	B
okay no we've uh we've had two children graduate so and i have worked at universities	2644	B
so it was a topic that uh seemed appropriate as far as discussion like this	2644	B
you had you're in the process of planning for or your children are there	2644	B
oh okay okay all right	2644	B
this May well good where are you	2644	B
very good uh uh the uh planning for college tuition and all the associated costs is a tough tough decision at	2644	B
how did you choose North Carolina State	2644	B
um-hum it's a land grant university right	2644	B
yeah	2644	B
the	2644	B
oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh there's as many	2644	B
to stay in the same area	2644	B
yeah uh two reasons for that i think if they even recommend in advanced degrees to	2644	B
uh try a different set of teachers get a different perspective as far as the the advanced degrees they'd like for you to change rather than stay in the same institution	2644	B
yeah	2644	B
right	2644	B
um-hum and i and i think a very good advisor would uh tell you that it's best for you anyway to get a different uh	2644	B
different set of instructors on it and a little different outlook and plus there are regional differences i think too California may have a different	2644	B
type of emphasis now agriculture changes by region as far as it's emphasis is concerned middle of the country would be wheat land here it's tobacco and uh California it may be	2644	B
uh more of the grapes and and uh other types of	2644	B
oh yes	2644	B
right	2644	B
um-hum	2644	B
yeah what is your specialty	2644	B
uh-huh	2644	B
um-hum um-hum	2644	B
no question	2644	B
no question you i'm sure you you and your classmates have been following the uh	2644	B
waste situation in North Carolina and the the absence or facility to handle	2644	B
right and it's it's a universal problem you know	2644	B
if you look at uh some countries you expect them to have problems Latin America now with cholera and and a bunch of other problems associated with	2644	B
waste management	2644	B
the United States you can expect more out of but we still have the same very deep problem of how to take care of our waste we create a bunch now now what do we do with it	2644	B
yeah and then i think there's a a big mistrust public mistrust as there is with nuclear energy	2644	B
uh they were talking about Chernobyl again this this week because it's an anniversary but i think there's a big mistrust of uh	2644	B
some of the waste management companies in terms of how well they do take care of their product	2644	B
and that's got to be solved i think there has to be public trust in it before you can	2644	B
find a good sight	2644	B
well i wish you luck in California	2644	B
okay	2644	B
same here bye	2644	B
well um so um have- do you have a son or daughter that's looking for a college	2644	A
ah i'm still in it	2644	A
uh-huh	2644	A
right	2644	A
no i'm i'm i'm i'm still in college i'm still a student	2644	A
i'm graduating this May yeah	2644	A
uh North Carolina State University	2644	A
yeah	2644	A
yeah i think it's it's when you're looking for a college that you want to go i think you really should know exactly what you want to be so you can pick the best quality	2644	A
i chose it basically that way uh North Carolina State has a reputation for being uh good agricultural school	2644	A
in the area	2644	A
exactly and um they have a good extension service for agriculture and uh i wanted to go into agriculture so i came here	2644	A
and since since i was in you know in-state i pay resident- i pay resident tuition so it was also a it was also good for me because you know being a good school plus in-state tuition saved me a lot of money	2644	A
right well for example yeah yeah i- i think that's very true because for example uh i'm going to graduate school after i finish here and uh i'm going to go to California	2644	A
that's true	2644	A
yeah i mean they would like for you to stay so that you know	2644	A
they they could keep getting your money but one you know an employer likes to see different schools i think	2644	A
right	2644	A
right they have in California they have a lot of heavy metal problems also and a lot of salts because of the valleys very- very salty	2644	A
that's what i- i was interested when i went over there i- i uh talked to some people in the university	2644	A
i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think that's what really turned me	2644	A
towards that you know the the school that i'm going to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision	2644	A
well i'm graduating with just a soil science degree here in North Carolina but i hopefully will go to California to receive a PhD in uh	2644	A
soil science with a specialization in environmental environmental quality	2644	A
which will deal with uh eco-toxicology heavy metals and soils and things like that so away from the production agriculture end of it and more into the soils and you know contaminants	2644	A
so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is going to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled	2644	A
and how to how to remediate them and all	2644	A
right especially in the sounds	2644	A
um-hum	2644	A
yeah now that now that it's getting harder to get permits for landfills uh the the problem's pressing down harder than ever	2644	A
yes uh i agree with you	2644	A
yeah uh thanks a lot it was nice talking to you all right bye	2644	A
well i keep trying to get away from them	2642	B
i used to use a lot of credit cards i guess for a while i would use you know a variety of the the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores but	2642	B
i think i i impulse buy too much with them or i buy things you know i see it on sale and i think oh it's on sale i have to get it	2642	B
and i really don't need it or i really haven't budgeted for it so um the last couple of years i really have tried not to use them_1 at all what about you	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
okay	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
right	2642	B
hum	2642	B
uh-huh	2642	B
that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something	2642	B
yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time yes	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
um	2642	B
right besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this	2642	B
yeah this thing that you thought you got on sale by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
um	2642	B
service charge you mean yearly fee yeah	2642	B
oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time	2642	B
what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still that they send you these things that look like checks	2642	B
and they say hey you know two thousand dollars you know free to you kind of thing you know all you got to do is go cash those things and you've got a short term loan	2642	B
i hate it i can't believe they have the nerve to do that	2642	B
uh-huh	2642	B
um-hum	2642	B
uh-huh	2642	B
yeah	2642	B
yeah i think it's it's somewhat a um symptom of our	2642	B
me generation and that we think we need all these things and i think my parents always	2642	B
you know did without or saved up to you know buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have	2642	B
you know like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but	2642	B
you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup and you don't you know do without too much and	2642	B
you know that's how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time	2642	B
you know you just have to have these things just you know have them_1 at home have to have them_1 at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um	2642	B
buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them_1 and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it	2642	B
but we're not into that we're into like have to have it all now	2642	B
well we're geared to that we're like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and	2642	B
going okay well it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars and i'll save for two years people go oh well i'll just go buy it put it on credit and i'll pay it off	2642	B
people aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it they just put it on a charge card put it on account and then pay off the bill because_1 they want it now it's always have to have it now	2642	B
no no but i have had some times when i've had some pretty good balances on there and uh you know i finally	2642	B
you know paid them_1 all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense so we don't uh have big balances on them_1 at all now we're we're you know we i use it occasionally but i pay it right off we're	2642	B
yeah you learn the you know the hard way you hate paying all that interest and i've never been one to itemize on my income tax and never had	2642	B
enough to itemize and so it's just a big chunk of money and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying so much more for that item	2642	B
because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what forty dollars sometimes just to have the card	2642	B
that's a lot of money that you went to buy this item	2642	B
and then you never feel like you've got anything to to put into savings or anything you're always just paying bills paying bills	2642	B
you know you don't feel that you have any extra to save and i hate i hate living paycheck to paycheck i like to have a little there you know that i can save so i can feel that you know if something comes up i've got the money to pay for it	2642	B
okay	2642	A
how do you feel about them_1	2642	A
yeah	2642	A
well we have this philosophy we use it when we go off somewhere	2642	A
but we pay for it as soon as we come back you know as soon as we get our bills we pay it off and we only have one we tore all the rest of them_1 up	2642	A
because i don't like credit cards for one thing you know i mean they're okay i guess if you're on a trip or something you don't have to take a whole bunch of you know cash with you but i don't like using	2642	A
because i've seen too many people that used them_1 and ended up bankrupt or on chapter thirteen and stuff like that because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you don't have to pay for it	2642	A
yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like	2642	A
uh-huh	2642	A
right are you married	2642	A
oh okay well i know that a lot of young people you know i it took me a long time to	2642	A
get it through my child's head i mean that was her goal you know uh got to have a credit card but now that she has one she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit	2642	A
but i think it finally sunk in you know because_1 she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them_1 say you know well i used a credit card	2642	A
and my husband's sister is the world's worst at oh well i'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit	2642	A
you know and i'm i'm thinking woman wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you but	2642	A
right and people don't see that either	2642	A
right the only one that we we have that we kept was the Discover card	2642	A
and it pays you to use it i mean if you pay your bill off right away if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it	2642	A
and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them_1 any uh interest now it's and people say well you know i'm making money by using this credit card but they don't realize that if they	2642	A
i mean it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest i mean you have to pay the interest not pay it right off	2642	A
that's going to take up what you would have made	2642	A
so that's the only reason that we kept that we debated for a long time plus they don't have that um	2642	A
charge on it you know like yeah right they don't have one of those	2642	A
so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears	2642	A
yes yes and then i'll- i'll have just like uh department stores they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to they'll send me any credit card i tear it up	2642	A
i just can't see it	2642	A
uh-huh	2642	A
yeah	2642	A
i know it and you know what	2642	A
what's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't you know we take the time to you know help my daughter she's in college	2642	A
but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know	2642	A
so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time	2642	A
you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are	2642	A
and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know they've got something maybe they've won something you know somebody sent them_1 something free and go out and spend it	2642	A
and um it's just unreal i mean i don't like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them_1 is if you were	2642	A
like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um	2642	A
i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen	2642	A
she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm going you just got off	2642	A
that's how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person but um it seems like people just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want	2642	A
and i just don't see it like that of course i always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover that's what you have but um maybe a lot of people don't see it like that but i can't stand owing	2642	A
i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that	2642	A
but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out	2642	A
but that's just the way i feel about it	2642	A
right	2642	A
yeah	2642	A
oh yeah i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that	2642	A
but um i guess it's because i'm older i mean i'm not real old but i am older and um you know i didn't feel like that i didn't feel like i had to have everything i guess it was because	2642	A
well i had everything when i was at home but i i don't know why i didn't	2642	A
um-hum	2642	A
yeah	2642	A
hm	2642	A
yeah um well it didn't hurt you did it to i mean you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything did you	2642	A
yeah well you learned then right	2642	A
yeah	2642	A
um-hum so then	2642	A
right	2642	A
um	2638	B
basically no	2638	B
um	2638	B
yeah i i uh uh the policy that TI has i think is uh uh very fair	2638	B
um i	2638	B
they first had a policy where they uh would test new employees and then since i've been with them the last four years uh there's been in the last year year and a half um they're doing random testing of all employees	2638	B
yes	2638	B
and it is it and from- from what i understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down	2638	B
uh-huh	2638	B
uh-huh	2638	B
yeah um i like it because um you know i i i grew up in the sixties i mean i graduated high school in sixty eight and	2638	B
and uh you know i i saw you know i know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who weren't and and uh you know it's i think it's a real problem	2638	B
and i think it and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems	2638	B
and so i'm hoping that uh a lot of other companies will will follow the same path	2638	B
um probably not	2638	B
uh-huh	2638	B
yeah i used to be in DSEG myself	2638	B
um A P D as a matter of fact	2638	B
yep	2638	B
very aware of it but i i'd i'd i really like the idea uh in fact i would like to see uh a lot more uh people uh adopt it uh like you know school systems and that kind of thing	2638	B
i mean i'd like i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or	2638	B
or uh who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs	2638	B
yeah	2638	B
and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up	2638	B
yeah yeah	2638	B
yeah rather than just uh	2638	B
put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself	2638	B
that's not going to help anybody get over the problem i believe it is a a a medical problem	2638	B
um of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too	2638	B
yeah so i mean there's a lot of things out there and	2638	B
things that uh	2638	B
i'm just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco	2638	B
yeah	2638	B
i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and and stuff and i uh uh i moved to a TI facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before	2638	B
because they were outside of the military sector it was uh an industrial company and uh you know that TI purchased and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it	2638	B
uh they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs and that's why they were opposed to it	2638	B
and uh it resulted in in a few people leaving	2638	B
you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy	2638	B
you know they had a lifestyle and they weren't going to change it	2638	B
and it's	2638	B
yeah	2638	B
i mean uh you should have no objection to it it's like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see	2638	B
why are we doing this well so you don't kill people on the road	2638	B
uh it's a basic- i mean it's the basic premise with you know drug testing	2638	B
especially some of the jobs um	2638	B
luckily i've always been in the engineering sector and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone i mean it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it	2638	B
but uh in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff	2638	B
yeah i darn if i'd want somebody down there that i'm working with side by side you know that could kill me	2638	B
by doing something incorrectly because they were	2638	B
not exactly all there because they were on drugs	2638	B
so there's a there's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out and i think in the long run we all benefit	2638	B
i mean if you have uh	2638	B
you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical and you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable	2638	B
well then the company's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere	2638	B
yep all over	2638	B
and uh	2638	B
it certainly does and	2638	B
i i just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball and and start it up	2638	B
well a lot of companies are are coming down in price and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits	2638	B
you know reduction- reduction in in medical costs if you know they	2638	B
yeah so i think everybody will will benefit from the program	2638	B
and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose uh	2638	B
mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent and of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own	2638	B
yeah and that'll cover it and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a uh	2638	B
as part of the package	2638	B
yeah so it i i think	2638	B
i think all around it it's going to help out a lot course	2638	B
yeah	2638	B
it was great talking with you	2638	B
you do the same	2638	B
bye-bye	2638	B
well i personally don't have any problem with uh drug testing employees or potential employees do you	2638	A
i mean basically	2638	A
okay	2638	A
i don't i really can't disagree with it	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
i think that's really the only fair way to do it	2638	A
i really think it ought to be some- you know Junkins all the way down	2638	A
right as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first isn't that a fact	2638	A
i've been retired from TI about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year	2638	A
before i retired so i was not uh ever called upon to do a drug test i certainly wouldn't object to it and i think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it	2638	A
oh i absolutely	2638	A
yeah	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
i don't think they'll have much choice do you	2638	A
especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything as matter of fact i want to believe that the uh	2638	A
defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know some- do some sort of you know drug testing i think that's really what maybe prompted TI to do it i was in the uh	2638	A
Defense Electronic Division when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know D O D to do this sort of thing	2638	A
yeah so you knew you know the atmosphere then	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
that's right- absolutely yeah i don't- i just can't disagree with you with you know the basic premise	2638	A
it's to much- as far as i know it's you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as uh you know the testing goes	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
and offer you you know help if you need help	2638	A
yeah i do too	2638	A
put you out on the street	2638	A
yeah	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
no absolute-	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
oh absolutely not to mention alcohol	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
right uh-huh	2638	A
oh yeah uh-huh	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
right	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
yep right yeah i know a lot of people who	2638	A
when it first began- or at least began was in the talking stage- you know everybody knew it was coming it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff	2638	A
but a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile and you know weighed the pros and cons decided you know it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs of course	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
that's right yep yep	2638	A
that's right or yourself or	2638	A
yeah	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
yeah that's true	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
yeah assembly people	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
absolutely	2638	A
uh-huh oh absolutely yeah	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
yeah sure	2638	A
sure	2638	A
trickles trickles up and down	2638	A
sure does	2638	A
yeah affects a lot of people	2638	A
yeah	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
i think they probably will you know if they i'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer	2638	A
i'm not sure every small company could do it	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
yeah yeah it's got to help them too	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
yeah i do too that's right	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
uh-huh	2638	A
no no but it- it'll save in some areas yeah right	2638	A
that's right	2638	A
that certainly could happen that's a very very- very very competitive business	2638	A
yeah i do too	2638	A
i just really can't disagree with you	2638	A
okay well it's nice to talk to you	2638	A
and you take care	2638	A
-okay bye-bye	2638	A
okay um	2603	A
i guess what i guess my	2603	A
my task i usually ride my bike i have uh a stationary bike and uh a regular bike and	2603	A
when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because it's just so much nicer the stationary bike is is so um	2603	A
boring but i have head phones and i plus i have it uh in the living room so i either watch TV or	2603	A
we have a fish tank so i watch the fish you know whatever i can do to keep myself occupied	2603	A
if i like to have the TV on because that usually keeps me um more occupied it kind of takes the time away and i don't realize really	2603	A
that's really the only time i ever watch TV is when i'm on the bike but	2603	A
and then usually after i'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk you know and that just kind of gets myself uh gets me you know	2603	A
to where i'm not quite as tired i guess but it's definitely a task i can't say that i really enjoy it i wish that i did enjoy it more but i do it because i have to not because i want to	2603	A
yeah yeah	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
really	2603	A
so is it just women that go there	2603	A
see i think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place uh a a health club because	2603	A
i don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise you know so i have tried to just do stuff at home	2603	A
yeah	2603	A
right	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
that's what	2603	A
really that's that's great how	2603	A
do they have a pool or what is	2603	A
huh	2603	A
i've heard that that's really good for you to do	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
so you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you when you're in the water	2603	A
oh wow that's funny i never would have thought of that	2603	A
like water- are they water shoes is that	2603	A
oh okay okay	2603	A
okay	2603	A
huh that's really funny	2603	A
huh	2603	A
that's	2603	A
so how often do you find yourself going um on a if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go	2603	A
yeah that's really	2603	A
really	2603	A
i wish that i could make myself exercise every day but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week which i don't feel like is enough but	2603	A
uh it's it's at least something you know it it i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really don't enjoy it but i know that i have to do it i mean it's just	2603	A
it's it's not a question of whether i want to you know	2603	A
but	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
oh that's	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
yeah	2603	A
did you ever	2603	A
well i'm sorry	2603	A
uh did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for TI	2603	A
did you ever try that	2603	A
oh okay	2603	A
um	2603	A
then that would yeah i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it	2603	A
oh	2603	A
wow	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
yeah	2603	A
oh	2603	A
wow	2603	A
what if you're already on one i mean yeah i mean when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs would they	2603	A
okay	2603	A
but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program is that what you're saying	2603	A
i see okay	2603	A
um	2603	A
um	2603	A
wow that's	2603	A
oh	2603	A
yeah that would be really nice	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
so you really do enjoy your exercise then since your	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
that's you know i wanted	2603	A
i wanted to get one of those steppers when i bought the bike but i got talked into the bike instead and	2603	A
i don't know	2603	A
i really wanted a stepper i'm considering maybe even buying one of those too but i'm not sure if i'll get benefit out of both of them i mean i don't know if it would really do any good having both of them	2603	A
which one do you feel is better since you use them both	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
huh	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
oh really	2603	A
um	2603	A
uh-hum	2603	A
uh-huh	2603	A
boring	2603	B
you think so	2603	B
i bought a stationary bike	2603	B
but i find that if i sit on that seat too long it hurts	2603	B
and i haven't figured how to get that soft and i tried even tying a pillow to it	2603	B
but two years ago i joined well it's not quite two years it's almost two years i joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano	2603	B
and i love it i just love it	2603	B
yeah it's totally women	2603	B
i like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess	2603	B
uh	2603	B
feel that okay fine if my bathing suit slips a little bit i don't have to be conscious of	2603	B
of it being a little bit too low and i my bathing suit's just one piece so there's no big deal all the way around but i don't have to be conscious of what i'm doing or how i'm doing it	2603	B
and it's uh oh it's just i don't know it's a it's a total free relaxation because hey you can do what you want you're a female and	2603	B
no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing	2603	B
and they've got such fantastic equipment in there	2603	B
oh yeah	2603	B
and i love the water aerobics i love the water aerobics	2603	B
oh yeah they've got a nice one	2603	B
they have two types of water aerobics they call it aqua exercise i guess is what they call it	2603	B
it pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself so it is like double strenuous but you're not	2603	B
being double strenuous on your own body because you're pushing it yourself	2603	B
so you're doing it yourself but	2603	B
every time i stop and start going again because i end up getting two jobs once in a while i end up having to quit for a while but i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because i really jump a lot	2603	B
but	2603	B
well a lot of people wear those little uh terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom	2603	B
especially around the pool so they just wear them right into the pool	2603	B
yeah they're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber you know soles so that you know no big deal one way or the other	2603	B
but i never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway so no big deal	2603	B
but it's fun	2603	B
i try to make it at least three times a week	2603	B
for a while i was doing it every day just	2603	B
going uh five days a week	2603	B
well	2603	B
when i was working up at uh The Summit here in Plano i'd leave there	2603	B
and i'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock	2603	B
oh actually about four thirty because they start at five to six so i was there by four thirty every night	2603	B
and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet	2603	B
because no matter what i did or how i did it i invariably got myself wet	2603	B
but the water only comes up basically to your	2603	B
anywhere from your waist to your oh chest i'd say	2603	B
so i mean it's your choice where you want to go but	2603	B
i enjoyed it higher	2603	B
that's okay	2603	B
i have a i have a bad back	2603	B
so i'm very limited what i do	2603	B
it's like i can walk	2603	B
but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me	2603	B
especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard it will bother me it will bother me	2603	B
well that what pushed me that way though was basically was the fact that when i went in there it wasn't for the water aerobics i went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles	2603	B
and uh she said hey go for the swimming pool she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor she says in fact you get more	2603	B
i said okay because i'm not a swimmer	2603	B
i like water i'm not scared of it but i couldn't i guess i could swim across the pool but i'm no swimmer per se	2603	B
but i found that this worked really well and i came out of there and i saw my stomach going down well	2603	B
i dropped oh i'd say almost twenty pounds	2603	B
just by watching what i ate and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good	2603	B
what a diet	2603	B
oh no they have nothing to do with that	2603	B
see i joined uh when this	2603	B
one down here opened up i joined as a VIP and the VIP gives you uh	2603	B
oh gives you a diet a computerized diet and they go over all your health and all your history and they show you how everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards	2603	B
so it became part of the package so i went through it	2603	B
it worked out well	2603	B
oh yeah you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too	2603	B
i just went took the because they were offering it as an opening benefit so it was	2603	B
it's less than what you pay now for going in there after all this time	2603	B
so it's like when i got laid off i went back in there and start all over again because it had been a while since i'd done it	2603	B
so i get all the same treatment again so it's kind of nice	2603	B
like i said i like it i like the heat i like the	2603	B
i jump out of the swimming pool and i go into the hot tub	2603	B
and i love it	2603	B
because i have never- i have never let me let me- reword that i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore	2603	B
but that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did	2603	B
that's i knew i was pushing too far	2603	B
but usually when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming or when i come out i'm totally relaxed when i go home it's no big deal	2603	B
it's fun it's fun	2603	B
uh i've gotten on the bike and they've got uh the stepping bike where you step	2603	B
and i've enjoyed that watching how well i can	2603	B
walk up and down stairs	2603	B
but most of the others to me are very dull	2603	B
um	2603	B
i get bored very easily	2603	B
uh the one nice thing about the bicycle	2603	B
is you just sit like you said you can sit and do it and watch the TV and not even really be conscious of what you are doing	2603	B
with the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down	2603	B
so you have a little you know little you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so	2603	B
to what your gear is	2603	B
uh i it would depend upon which one you want i think now that i've had the bicycle	2603	B
i would go to the stepper	2603	B
but if i were you i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others	2603	B
and use it for a while because you can buy a month's membership and see what you feel is best for you	2603	B
because it all depends you know for everyone their own what they want to do	2603	B
because i jump on the bike here at home	2603	B
mine has its see the handle bars go up and down so i can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said and it has no effect on me	2603	B
so i mean it's	2603	B
boring	2603	B
yes	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
do you	2621	B
uh-huh i i always enjoy watching this Dallas- the Dallas and Pittsburgh together you know	2621	B
does he really	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
oh wow i wonder if he'd ever do that	2621	B
yes	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
uh-huh well what about the Houston Oilers do you like them	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
uh-huh and Warren Moon is is proving himself quite well right now	2621	B
uh-huh he's one of the few uh black quarterbacks that there are	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
i don't know i hope they they do better they they during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better	2621	B
but uh i think they still have a little i think they're still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing	2621	B
or if they even reach that potential again you know they may never reach that again	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah four in a row	2621	B
oh i don't know shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now so	2621	B
i think Mike Webster was left but then he he just left uh	2621	B
yeah i think he is i think he was	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
no i didn't	2621	B
huh-uh	2621	B
uh	2621	B
yeah	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
oh	2621	B
really	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah yeah-	2621	B
oh you know that's really funny um well i i come from a large family and there- there's quite a few boys so that's kind of how i got in with the football with either watch that or watch nothing and um	2621	B
at one time i could name all the players on the Steelers you know and but even when Bradshaw was playing i i don't know i i didn't particularly care for him i thought he was kind of cocky or something uh-huh	2621	B
yes uh-huh	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah him and Franco Harris i really didn't care for the either two of them	2621	B
i mean they were good but i you know you couldn't deny that but i didn't i thought you know well i just didn't really care for either one of them uh today my favorites out of those guys were probably um	2621	B
Lambert Ham and uh Stallworth and Swan	2621	B
yeah	2621	B
uh-huh i i i like not just with the Pittsburgh i like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the the best plays from you know the week or something	2621	B
yeah i love watching that then i like watching their bloopers too you know	2621	B
yeah uh-huh it's funny that more people don't get hurt	2621	B
you know especially i would say the receivers when they're in the air and they get tackled	2621	B
oh yeah it's funny some of their necks don't get broken	2621	B
yeah	2621	B
an they have to be in ideal physical shape basically	2621	B
yeah well what did you think of um a couple years ago for the Bears the refrigerator	2621	B
oh you know and to me he does um oh he's just so big and fat he doesn't even look like he's in shape he's just so big no one can move him	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah	2621	B
wow	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
oh yeah there's there are some really big guys playing in football	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah you would	2621	B
uh-huh um now who would you say that you have a favorite- i mean other than Dallas would you say that you have uh a favorite quarterback i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the the attention you know	2621	B
yeah i really- i i enjoy watching him play	2621	B
no but he's still performing	2621	B
yes he is i i i enjoy watching him also	2621	B
what about uh Marino	2621	B
i think he'll get better as he gets older	2621	B
because he he well was- he was the youngest quarterback there was wasn't he	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
that's true that's true	2621	B
uh probably around twelve	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah um i didn't i don't know i i just think you know Marino will get better and uh his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl you know so	2621	B
yeah	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah that's true yeah- and with age comes you know the the i'm sure arthritis sets in with them you know right yeah	2621	B
uh-huh and they're so young but they're retired you know and their so young still	2621	B
oh	2621	B
oh yeah but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that	2621	B
yeah a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple	2621	B
holy smokes i didn't that doesn't seem like very long	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
uh-huh	2621	B
yeah um what do you think of the uh LA Raiders used to the the Oakland	2621	B
yeah	2621	B
yes they have uh-huh	2621	B
but a lot of women are are knowledge- as knowledgeable about pro football as i am	2621	A
can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the Cowboys too	2621	A
they've had some great games in the past	2621	A
uh-huh me too	2621	A
it wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys i'll tell you he lives in the Dallas area now as a matter of fact	2621	A
well actually it's probably closer to Fort Worth but it's it's in the same area he bought uh bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke Texas	2621	A
but he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often as a matter of fact there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job	2621	A
i don't know he'd be good at it he's such a motivator he he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do	2621	A
yeah okay i'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl that would be really great	2621	A
that may not ever happen i don't know uh Houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years and in the earlier years they really had some super teams	2621	A
that's right	2621	A
he certainly is he's very good	2621	A
he's very good	2621	A
that's right Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia i guess last year but he's no longer with the team	2621	A
so you're right there are very few black quarterbacks or at least that are starting anyway how do you think the Steelers are going to do this year you have any idea	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
yeah	2621	A
oh yeah that was just that was just super team	2621	A
yeah	2621	A
well that's a tough it would be tough to do it really would they have such a super team for years	2621	A
that won what four Super Bowls	2621	A
four in a row i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not	2621	A
yeah	2621	A
that's right and	2621	A
that's right that's right	2621	A
uh-huh yeah	2621	A
he may have been the last of the old guard i don't know	2621	A
um-hum yeah	2621	A
they had such a super team	2621	A
have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday	2621	A
i see	2621	A
there's quite a bit of activity now of course they had so many you know nice uh choices because their record was so lousy the last few years they picked up you know quiet a few	2621	A
of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know may- may never play a game you just- never know it's it's a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know	2621	A
ever been	2621	A
probably an old guy that played probably before you were born his name was Sam Huff he used to play for the New York Giants	2621	A
that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life as far as you know dedication he just went all out every single play of course there have been some other great ones too Dick Butkis and Bradshaw you know there's been so many	2621	A
but if i had to pick one i would probably pick Sam Huff as a matter of fact	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
that's right	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
he is he is of course there- a quarterback has a big ego	2621	A
they really do- they have to have they can't survive	2621	A
they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up i'll tell you	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
oh yeah	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
uh-huh absolutely i can't disagree with that they were super players they really were they really	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
yeah highlights yeah uh-huh	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
yeah yeah that's kind of funny too as a matter of fact some of them a a bit embarrassing	2621	A
yeah well they make mistakes too i guess	2621	A
absolutely	2621	A
absolutely	2621	A
uh-huh go ahead	2621	A
they take such a beating	2621	A
absolutely i don't know how they do it it's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit it's just a matter of how hard you know or where	2621	A
oh absolutely they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem gosh what a beating they really do take a beating they really do	2621	A
i think he was just probably a passing phenomena i think i don't know i i'm	2621	A
knowing what you know of course Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around i really am he's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
that's right yeah absolutely there's just so much mass there i guess they just can't i don't know you know i probably the guy is you know is probably physically strong i you know obviously not very fast but i guess it's just	2621	A
like you say a mass that nobody can seem to- to get out of the way as far as him scoring touch downs you know i think that was kind of weird i don't know	2621	A
Dallas has a guy uh his name is Nate Newton now he has a real weight problem too he fights it every single year but he manages to still keep playing but	2621	A
he has a terrible weight problem	2621	A
they watch- the coaches watch him all year long they they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control	2621	A
but i guess most every team has some- has someone like that i don't know	2621	A
absolutely they get bigger and bigger it seems every year i guess you have to to	2621	A
you know to stay in the game i guess yeah	2621	A
oh yeah sure well you'd have to uh or i would have to say you know someone like Montana i guess who's done so well for so many years	2621	A
yeah his age is about to catch up with him though	2621	A
he's no Spring chicken anymore and like you say Warren Moon's an excellent Warren Moon's an excellent but he's very exciting to watch uh-huh sure uh-huh absolutely	2621	A
uh i'm obviously he's a very good quarterback i'd i never was you know too a whole lot of a big fan you know	2621	A
yeah he may uh-huh	2621	A
yes he was i believe that's right at one point in time yeah- but he's a very young fellow yeah	2621	A
of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot of you know if he's got a good supporting cast you know if not he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway you know well- Dallas did better last year hopefully they'll do better this year	2621	A
uh-huh	2621	A
that's right that's right yeah Miami's had some down years too	2621	A
but they all do i guess it's it's cyclical i guess as the players get older	2621	A
get slower	2621	A
yeah	2621	A
oh yeah	2621	A
oh yes very much so hip injuries and things like that yeah yeah that that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game	2621	A
that's right uh-huh yeah i read some time well not too long ago that the average	2621	A
uh professional career only lasts seven years so that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course	2621	A
yeah but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years you know	2621	A
that's right yeah that's right yeah	2621	A
that's that's a pretty short career on average	2621	A
of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments they'll you know they'll do all right but a lot of them don't unfortunately	2621	A
yeah they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws if their if their	2621	A
you know perception i don't know Al Davis is he's a kind of strange character strange strange looking guy apparently he's	2621	A
kind of a wild guy i don't really know for sure they've had some excellent teams though obviously they i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play they keeping talk about you know going	2621	A
yeah i am	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
uh in the front end the wafer fab	2668	B
where do you work	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
oh great	2668	B
oh wow	2668	B
you going to Motorola	2668	B
oh	2668	B
oh	2668	B
oh yeah	2668	B
oh yeah	2668	B
were you happy with your return this year were you happy with your tax return this year	2668	B
was it negative	2668	B
okay	2668	B
i think my biggest gripe is the gigantic federal income tax i came from a state that paid	2668	B
uh state taxes three years ago and that seemed to be relatively small compared to like the uh the tax you pay on sales sale items	2668	B
and um	2668	B
i don't know i think uh my biggest gripe is with federal	2668	B
Indiana	2668	B
right	2668	B
yeah though it's a percentage you divide that well you uh how much you paid or something by your federal	2668	B
right	2668	B
there's a lot of tax breaks for like	2668	B
you know a lot of things if you're involved in the state like uh giving to colleges and things like that that they'll break you for	2668	B
um not even sure because_1 i was a student so i didn't pay that much	2668	B
but uh	2668	B
right and what percent would that be	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
i know well you can't deduct for credit card interest that type of thing	2668	B
yeah	2668	B
right right	2668	B
oh yeah	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
oh wow	2668	B
what happened	2668	B
oh my gosh	2668	B
oh man	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
oh yeah	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
fifty cents-	2668	B
it's incredible	2668	B
uh	2668	B
no i don't i just got married i don't have any children	2668	B
three years	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
yeah	2668	B
i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldn't have so much money going to so many different schools	2668	B
yeah	2668	B
yeah i've heard that	2668	B
really	2668	B
sounds like TI is was getting ready to	2668	B
yeah and then all your money goes to overhead	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
right	2668	B
yeah	2668	B
right in Dallas it uh might be a little less here in Sherman	2668	B
oh really	2668	B
oh wow	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
oh really	2668	B
well	2668	B
now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax	2668	B
oh man	2668	B
think it was like five and a half percent	2668	B
yeah Purdue	2668	B
no Purdue	2668	B
uh-huh	2668	B
oh yeah	2668	B
yeah	2668	B
oh great	2668	B
oh	2668	B
yeah they well it's just been the last three or four years actually they had poor seasons before that but	2668	B
yeah they	2668	B
yeah they've been exciting to watch	2668	B
supervision	2668	B
yeah	2668	B
lot of theory um it's pretty it's pretty broad	2668	B
uh took some engineering courses some math a lot of uh a lot of theory lot of practical like personal um problems and personnel problems and that type of thing	2668	B
yeah	2668	B
yeah the The Boss Course	2668	B
yeah that was a really good course	2668	B
are you- are you a TIer Carla	2668	A
oh and you work in the Sherman plant uh whereabouts	2668	A
oh okay good deal oh i'm in Dallas i'm in uh in SC group QRA i i'm kind of a worldwide quality manager based here in Dallas uh mostly the offshore assembly sites	2668	A
except i'm fixing not to be a TIer after a week from today	2668	A
no i'm going to Onum	2668	A
uh it's a subcontractor house they uh they builds in fact they build product for TI but it's been thirty two years so i mean i've i've served i've done my time	2668	A
okay you ready to talk about taxes okay	2668	A
huh	2668	A
what did you say	2668	A
no no	2668	A
okay i guess we're on the air now	2668	A
uh well what do you uh what do you think uh uh what what's your biggest gripe do you think is it the proposed state income tax or the or the gigantic federal income tax we seem to be paying every year or what	2668	A
um-hum um-hum	2668	A
what what state are you from Carla	2668	A
Indiana you had a state income tax there are you able to credit that against your federal income tax	2668	A
oh okay so you do get some credit but not the whole thing	2668	A
okay because_1	2668	A
oh i see	2668	A
okay what uh uh what generally what percent of your income is it	2668	A
oh okay okay	2668	A
and because as as you know where uh there's there's uh a ugly rumors on the horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas	2668	A
yeah	2668	A
uh i have no idea i- i i uh i'm i'm originally from Massachusetts but they didn't have a state income tax when i worked when i lived there so i have uh no and i know they have one now uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is	2668	A
but you know getting back to the getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff	2668	A
uh i don't believe it it's worse	2668	A
oh sure and i seem to have more of that every year and uh yeah the only thing that's left deductible is uh is mortgage uh interest basically	2668	A
and would then and and that's significant and every once in a while they make noises like they're going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did	2668	A
and and uh	2668	A
one other things that i only found out this year and uh uh i thought at one time i worked in in Malaysia for TI	2668	A
and and had more money than i knew what to do with so i started making accelerated house payments and i said gee you know this would be great because i'll i'll have a lot of equity in my house	2668	A
then when my children are old enough to go to college i'll get a equity loan which will increase my mortgage so i'll be able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest deduction part	2668	A
guess what	2668	A
that that's not legal in Texas it's the only state in the country that it's not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas	2668	A
and and so i- i got this i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that i've got almost paid off	2668	A
and have all kinds of equity in it and don't have and you know struggling to keep i've got two children in college and i'm going to have three by September	2668	A
but but uh it it was just my fault not checking it up because i've heard of people doing it so i thought it was pretty good deal	2668	A
so but the uh uh i i it just seems to me that the that the income tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year	2668	A
and and i'm not exactly sure what- what we get in return i was listening to a talk show i don't know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there but i listened to David Gold this afternoon on KLIF and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four	2668	A
Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes	2668	A
and now we're paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents when you consider federal income tax FICA tax sales tax and all the other things we get hit with	2668	A
and- it is it is absolutely incredible and	2668	A
and and the mentality that you cure ills by throwing money at it and you throw and you raise the money to throw at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible	2668	A
uh is you know do you have children in school	2668	A
oh you know you just got married okay well you one of the worst things in Texas- how long you been in Texas	2668	A
oh okay well you'll find out one of these days because you probably came from a state that's got a very decent public school system and you'll find out that in Texas we've got uh i think we rank fiftieth out of fifty states	2668	A
and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise taxes spend more money	2668	A
yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching	2668	A
than they do in the public schools and and my my son goes to a uh uh high school here in the Richardson school district which is one of the better ones in Texas	2668	A
uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything	2668	A
and and and they've got uh i don't know what the ratio is but they've got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching	2668	A
and it is sort of like we do at TI	2668	A
uh and and get them in the classroom plus	2668	A
uh i don't know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that aren't going allow first- first of all they're not college prep courses and i don't think they're going	2668	A
help a person make a living they're just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate	2668	A
and and and all that and uh so i'm i'm not i'm not overly pleased with that either but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh uh somewhere around eight percent now isn't it	2668	A
and	2668	A
yeah i i think right here in Dallas we're paying about eight percent and you know uh i say i was initially from Massachusetts i've been here thirty two years but they used to call it {Taxachusetts} and uh i was there on business this last weekend	2668	A
and i i made a few purchases and i realized that as bad as their reputation is their sales tax only about five percent	2668	A
i know there were several things that i bought that were something in the order of a dollar and i noticed it was about five cents added onto it plus it doesn't cut it as early you know you buy a ten cent candy in seven eleven here and you pay eleven cents	2668	A
for- it and and i notice theirs doesn't cut in much below fifty cents i think	2668	A
so so the little items you pay what the price tag says	2668	A
i don't know i- i don't i bet they're not i- i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces	2668	A
but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes	2668	A
uh what what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana- Indiana	2668	A
uh-huh okay yeah did you go to school there in Indiana Indiana University	2668	A
oh Purdue okay you were you were a Boilermaker huh yeah yeah you follow the girls uh basketball team boy we were we're- we're- we're tremendous uh girls basketball fans here and we saw them we saw them play in the Midwest Regionals down in Austin last year	2668	A
and we were Lady Longhorn fans naturally but we did see Purdue- so we're aware uh that they've that they've got a very good program there	2668	A
yeah	2668	A
yeah and i think they went further this year uh i i think they got into the second or third round of the of the play-off this year yeah	2668	A
yeah and uh that's an what did you get- get your degree in	2668	A
okay supervision- supervision- that's an interesting degree uh what what sort of things does it entail	2668	A
uh-huh	2668	A
are -you are you actively in supervision now have have you taken some of the TI supervisory skill courses	2668	A
yeah the Boss Course	2668	A
yeah and and i was i was going to ask you what did you think of it relevant to some of	2668	A
okay um	2631	B
i have two children and they're older now but um i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i taught school	2631	B
and um	2631	B
i wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home and that's what i looked for and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school and that worked	2631	B
yeah that worked out real well but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation three i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and and be around kids their own age because i think that's	2631	B
that that would prepare them for school also it's real important that they do that um that they get that preparation for school	2631	B
so but i had i have switched schools several times because i did- i really didn't care for what was going on at that the school i wanted them to learn to play i didn't academics forced on them at an early age	2631	B
yeah for the school- for the kids yeah	2631	B
uh-huh	2631	B
okay	2631	B
wonderful	2631	B
oh great	2631	B
oh that's wonderful	2631	B
oh great	2631	B
oh that's wonderful too	2631	B
uh-huh	2631	B
oh that's wonderful	2631	B
oh dear	2631	B
sure yeah	2631	B
oh you know that's an ideal situation but not many people can afford something like that	2631	B
sure	2631	B
uh-huh	2631	B
sure	2631	B
oh i do too	2631	B
oh yeah but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that uh lucky um	2631	B
because i'm a single parent and i uh you know my husband and i ex-husband and i got a divorce um when the children were small and so i uh was a teacher i uh still am teacher and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was	2631	B
that was what i wanted where i could have piece of mind and when i taught school and i knew my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus i	2631	B
i uh wanted them to get something out of it i just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and	2631	B
that's it	2631	B
right	2631	B
i agree with that	2631	B
well the thing is i teach fifth grade and i i can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other children and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically because	2631	B
they were not they're should be there's to many things in their way and so i want my i wanted my children and they did learn to get to get along with other people	2631	B
yeah and i mean i feel a lot of maladjusted adults and i bet if we trace back to their early childhood we could see some	2631	B
you know times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with people	2631	B
uh-huh	2631	B
i bet you could too because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really you know good adults or	2631	B
successful adults i should say you know really	2631	B
but uh it is a big problem and you know i have lot of friends right now that uh have young children and they	2631	B
daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child or they switch a lot which is not good for the child either	2631	B
so you need because_1 you need that consistency when they're young like that and it would be ideal like you you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home i would have have given anything if i would have been able to stay home with my children yeah you are	2631	B
right	2631	B
oh great	2631	B
um-hum	2631	B
oh that's wonderful	2631	B
oh that's good	2631	B
you're very wise	2631	B
sure	2631	B
uh-huh	2631	B
oh don't they though that's what i have right now thirteen and a sixteen year old oh it is they really are expensive yeah	2631	B
exactly well and they most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars so	2631	B
you know right now i'm looking for a little truck for my for my son so that you know an older older older truck so i can afford it but you know	2631	B
i i just look forward to him helping me out because i- i for years just car driven carpools all over the place and	2631	B
and it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take	2631	B
his sister somewhere or something like that	2631	B
right exactly	2631	B
right	2631	B
that's right	2631	B
it does forever	2631	B
and then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren so it's not ending is it you think we've talked a long a long enough time	2631	B
oh they come in see this is the first time i've done this	2631	B
oh in ten minutes you have to talk that long	2631	B
uh-huh	2631	B
oh	2631	B
i see	2631	B
i see are you from the where are you from	2631	B
oh my gosh i'm from uh Plano Texas which is which is outside of Dallas	2631	B
yeah because that's where TI is that makes sense	2631	B
uh-huh	2631	A
well that's good	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yeah yeah	2631	A
uh-huh	2631	A
yeah i um that that's oh oh you mean you switched schools for the kids uh-huh	2631	A
well- well i'm just recently married so i don't have any children though we plan on having them soon but i think um	2631	A
i think um that i that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties uh i think um i'm lucky though that um	2631	A
my wife will probably not have to work while our children are under four or five yeah because- because- i'm a college professor so and that's also and it's nice for me because um	2631	A
most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week and then one or two evenings so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um	2631	A
there probably will be a possibility that i could stay home two days that she would go to work and that i would have to teach at night	2631	A
yeah so it will probably workout real nice for us uh i think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules	2631	A
i can even teach on Saturdays and and things like that yeah um i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding uh child care and one of the things they made in um uh real	2631	A
they're number one priority was that um they're children didn't have to leave their home so they um um my sister-in-law is a uh	2631	A
um a clinical speech pathologist so she is also- i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work	2631	A
she applied for a director's position and- and got it so i guess she's very well qualified for her field i guess and even though she took off two years for um	2631	A
i guess four years all together it would be three years how old's Kayla three yeah i guess she took off three years all together um	2631	A
for because_1 i guess they have a four year old and yeah and my nephew's two almost two so i guess she took off three all together and then when she decided to go back to work um	2631	A
she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home	2631	A
yeah i think they were really lucky there but i think they've lost this woman she will- she will not continue and and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school	2631	A
so i don't know what they are going to do	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yeah i think i think they they're both they were both professionals unlike me they're um they'll my they were married	2631	A
my brother's five years younger then she is so she was probably twenty seven when they were married so she already had had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a profession- in a practice almost um	2631	A
um where you know he then they waited a couple years and and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty seven- twenty six so by that time she was so well	2631	A
established you know i guess it made it a lot easier but uh i think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is if you have that	2631	A
that professional occupation where you can change	2631	A
yeah	2631	A
no- yeah that's right that's true yeah	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yep yeah definitely	2631	A
we're safe yeah	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yeah that's you know that's so important i um	2631	A
i i guess	2631	A
it's so funny now with schools you know they don't take kid into kindergarten and when i guess when they're five and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now and they don't let them into kindergarten unless they can	2631	A
count to ten and they know their ABCs and i think that's so funny because um	2631	A
i don't i don't know if i want school's very important i'm an educator myself and my wife teaches and i it's a very important part of your life and i hope to read with my kids but i don't know if i want my kids to go to school at four	2631	A
or three you know i can see that- that when you make that point	2631	A
yeah	2631	A
uh-huh	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yeah	2631	A
yeah	2631	A
uh-huh that's a really important point	2631	A
yeah	2631	A
i think that's really that's important i i've seen the same thing i i think you're exactly right because you know i've gone out- or before i was married i went out with a girl and you know um	2631	A
boy after you know after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between	2631	A
day care centers when she was one and two and three years old and never always being a bit snippy and spiteful i bet you could trace all the way back	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
that's true	2631	A
uh-huh	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yep that's true yeah that's really true uh	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yeah i i think i'm i'm very lucky um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule	2631	A
especially- i teach a computer classes so it's it's one of things where i'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor and i'm also um you know they have vocational type courses on weekends	2631	A
almost everywhere and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday which means that you know whole week's worth of courses so that lets you be available three days during the week	2631	A
you know so you be will home with your kids i you know it's really funny is that i i picked this career when i was in college because uh i think with my commitment to family and um wanting to spend more time with my children	2631	A
you know because my dad had very um nine to five type job with uh forty five minute commute into the city and a forty five commute home so by the time he got home he was so tired and	2631	A
he was all rung out from the day and i think he he missed a lot of um our up bringing you know my mother i i came from a family that- that my mother stayed home until we started school um	2631	A
um and i i don't uh it's funny i don't think she had to work until we started school i think teenagers become much more expensive	2631	A
for it	2631	A
it's probably costing you a fortune	2631	A
my goodness if if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill the- um	2631	A
oh	2631	A
um-hum	2631	A
yeah	2631	A
carpools uh-huh	2631	A
yeah my parents did a lot of that	2631	A
that's right yep and just to save you trips to and from you know uh ball games and athletic events and activities at the school yeah isn't that something how you know you think about child care and it lasts along time	2631	A
it it lasts a long time	2631	A
well normally they come in uh	2631	A
oh oh cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us	2631	A
well you don't have to but they they um you go the length and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes	2631	A
depends on how old the tapes are at that time	2631	A
uh-huh	2631	A
yeah	2631	A
this is Baltimore Maryland	2631	A
yeah well most of most of the people i talk to are from Texas	2631	A
uh-huh yeah and i've discussed i've discussed um	2631	A
here we go i guess we're on the air huh yeah well i tell you what this been pretty nice today hasn't it	2685	B
um-hum	2685	B
yeah i'm well i'm on i'm taking some vacation this week so it didn't bother me uh i'm a distance runner by hobby and uh i might say it was a little humid running out there tonight i was probably wetter than i have been in some time	2685	B
but uh for for a guy that likes to be outside as much as i do and run like i do this Texas is almost ideal	2685	B
because uh i would say probably i run three hundred days out of the three hundred and sixty five and there's probably not more than thirty of those days that i can't wear shorts and tee shirt	2685	B
i mean i have to wear long sleeves and maybe some long pants and that's fine with me if i can wear shorts and tee shirt i'm perfectly happy	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
well what what what we like to do is to get enough rain so not to have to water the lawn	2685	B
and it's been i've watered once in March and not any time in April because i figure we figure if we go five days without rain we need to water and just about every fifth day we're getting rain right now	2685	B
so everything is pretty and green here and we're not really uh and not having to pay money to water	2685	B
and uh of course of course summers summers uh i i guess uh once you get {climatized} and i am i mean i kind of look forward to the hundred degrees days except- except for the air conditioning bills i i could i could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills	2685	B
um-hum	2685	B
oh for goodness sake oh i know what that means	2685	B
that means mud in the road yep	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
oh sure	2685	B
what what do you do you put in up there do you i mean here we know we know two grasses Saint Augustine and Bermuda uh what what do you normally put in up there	2685	B
uh-huh	2685	B
uh-huh	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
uh-huh	2685	B
oh that happens here too	2685	B
but this year of course we got uh we had a very mild winter this year with very little freeze	2685	B
uh so we didn't have any problem uh uh with the uh uh with the grass greening up quickly you know last year it was well into May before all the bare spots got covered	2685	B
uh because of the of the severe winter that we had around Christmas of eighty nine but this year it uh	2685	B
we did have some cold days but not down in the single digits or anything like that so when things started greening up in March they greened up and everybody's grass is is	2685	B
is perfectly green do your homes you say you moved into a new home are homes normally- built there with central air conditioning is that part of the uh the standard for a home	2685	B
oh okay i i didn't know whether you were far enough south for that of course i'm i'm from New England my parents are there and it's it's unheard of there i guess anybody that wants air conditioning goes out and puts a window unit in	2685	B
um-hum	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
no	2685	B
yeah the humidity is eighty degrees along with it	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
uh-hum	2685	B
yeah i'm i'm aware of that did you have a very severe winter	2685	B
um-hum	2685	B
okay	2685	B
yeah yeah we we had zero snow here in fact we haven't had any measurable accumulation now in six or seven years uh	2685	B
yeah that was a nice one too that was an ice storm there and uh uh i remember one year	2685	B
i can't tell you the exact year it was probably about uh eighty seventy nine or eighty that we had such a severe ice storm that it uh knocked tree limbs down on the wires and there were some uh four hundred thousand homes out of electricity	2685	B
and i know it was after seventy eight because we built our home here in seventy eight and it was a new development that didn't have any trees yet so we had electricity and we had fifteen people camped out on our floor in sleeping bags	2685	B
and and unfortunately when it thawed then most everybody's houses got filled with water too and uh but we we were fortunate that year and even at that this development was built in seventy eight and even now all- all the utilities run under ground	2685	B
so there's still no big trees in the development but the uh uh all all the utilities so we we wouldn't have to look forward to that but we had a uh we had a mild winter as i say the previous year	2685	B
we had three or four days uh it- it wasn't much it was only about a week and i think it was the week just prior to Christmas when the temperature got down into the single digits	2685	B
and as a result a lot of the the trees and uh the grass and shrubbery was killed uh was killed out and at this time last year nothing looked very good but it it does right now uh at this time last year	2685	B
we were under water most of Texas was under water uh if you remember uh uh uh downtown Dallas you could go down and look up in the Reunion Tower and look over toward the Trinity River and it looked like lakes not a river	2685	B
and uh Lake Texoma was up uh twenty feet over flood level	2685	B
uh at at this time last year it was it was uh it was pretty bad but uh i'm i'm hoping you know you you don't want anything to flood but you want to get normal rain and uh we're probably some where near normal right now	2685	B
how long have you been back in Maryland from Texas	2685	B
eighty nine okay	2685	B
yeah and where did you say you lived in Plano	2685	B
uh-huh	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
oh okay okay that's a nice facility at Spring Creek isn't it that's the that's the Taj Mahal of TI facilities	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
well well we're in the i don't know if you're familiar with the center complex	2685	B
uh in in Dallas it's across LBJ from the main TI site it's three glass buildings and that for someone that's been at TI thirty two years this is kind of {unTI} like too	2685	B
yeah	2685	B
yeah i'm in i'm in center one the big thing that i think other than the fact that we've all got double the size offices we've ever had anywhere else and- it's so quiet that you can hear a pin drop to me the big advantage and i didn't realize it when we came over here is the covered parking	2685	B
it is amazing in the middle of the summer when it's a hundred and ten out to go out and be able to get into your car and touch the steering wheel	2685	B
which we could never do parked outside of the SC Building or the South Building or various other places that i've i worked and and you notice the finish on your car lasts longer when you wash it it stays clean longer	2685	B
uh it is is uh uh to me to me that's that's probably one of the biggest advantages that we've got over there plus i'm in center one and the credit union is down on the first floor	2685	B
uh-huh	2685	B
uh-huh	2685	B
oh that that's Texas like	2685	B
that's Texas like	2685	B
did you ever get out to Midland while you were here	2685	B
yep	2685	A
uh yeah we've been uh real lucky here it was one of those days where you wish you uh you didn't want to have to go back into work	2685	A
uh-huh	2685	A
huh	2685	A
yeah	2685	A
yeah i would-	2685	A
i remember how the weather was when i was down there i got a sunburn in February working on my uh my roof in a house in Plano	2685	A
so i uh i remember how it was yeah it's it's really great um here on the east coast we've you know we usually have the traditional April showers but it has just been so unusually wet here	2685	A
we've had all the rain that they should've had out in California	2685	A
yeah	2685	A
well that's great	2685	A
yeah i remember those	2685	A
yeah well we've moved into a new house uh at the end of February	2685	A
and of course it's a new development and there's only one house in the whole thirty houses that are here that has grass	2685	A
so everything everything else is mud	2685	A
there's mud in the road there's mud on the sidewalk there's mud in the house i mean you just can't get away from it and of course it's been you know ideal weather for grass to grow	2685	A
and unfortunately they haven't gotten around to put they you know they were waiting until they got i think the other two houses on the cul-de-sac on one done before they're going to plant all the grass at one time	2685	A
uh-huh	2685	A
you can put in any number of grasses up here uh a lot people like the red fescue they like to mix red fescue in with uh Kentucky Blue um the uh	2685	A
my favorite is uh a zoysia grass uh when i lived in Laura which is about sixty miles south of where i'm living now	2685	A
uh that my neighbor had it and i was forever trying to get you know decent grass to grow in my yard and he talked me into trying to some plugs of the zoysia and i just loved it because the zoysia you can uh you can quite literally just plug it around the yard	2685	A
and it just spreads and it chokes out the weeds and the weeds can't get in there and so you don't have to weed and feed and do all that other crazy stuff you just you know the only bad part about it is during the winter the grass is brown but i mean you know	2685	A
yeah	2685	A
uh-huh	2685	A
yes pretty much standard now	2685	A
well the uh the thing about uh Maryland is um the last few years uh since i've been back and uh it was like that oh it started this way about mid seventies	2685	A
um we started having a very abbreviated Spring	2685	A
you would go from having fifty sixty degree days right into the eighty eighty five degree days which you know in Texas it's not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty	2685	A
and eighty per cent and and and worse i mean i've seen days here when the humidity is like ninety three a hundred per cent and it's just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world	2685	A
uh not really we had uh a couple uh real good snow storms uh but they were the kind that came stayed for a couple of days and then melted off and that's the best kind to have around here	2685	A
yeah i remember the uh ice storm back in uh nineteen eighty eight	2685	A
yeah	2685	A
wow	2685	A
jeez	2685	A
oh God	2685	A
uh-huh	2685	A
yes	2685	A
yeah i remember that	2685	A
wow	2685	A
yeah i noticed uh tonight when i was out driving around that the uh the one of the main reservoirs in the county i live in is uh fuller that i've ever seen it i mean it's it's up over its banks but it's not that far over its banks	2685	A
uh moved back here in uh eighty nine	2685	A
yes so i spent two uh just about two years exactly in Texas	2685	A
uh yeah i lived in Plano	2685	A
um worked at Spring Creek for a while and was on the moon job and then when my clearance came through for APD i worked for DSEG uh worked at North Billings for a while and then down at Love Field	2685	A
oh God	2685	A
i tell you it spoils you rotten to work there	2685	A
you work there and they send you any place else it's like you've been demoted	2685	A
right	2685	A
i had a uh a uh an employee that i hired there Lita Mytek	2685	A
um Lita Mytek i mean she uh she worked over in the building at Center Three i think it was and uh you know she said she liked it over there	2685	A
yeah	2685	A
uh-huh	2685	A
um i'd i'd prefer it not to be that hot	2685	A
uh the the days usually aren't aren't that bad um it's just when the humidity gets up i mean it's like last week we had a day it was i think it was eighty degrees but the humidity for some strange reason was only nineteen per cent and that	2685	A
yeah that was a rarity for here and God it was just beautiful	2685	A
no i never did	2685	A
oh did you already dial one	2643	A
we're being recorded already	2643	A
okay uh we're supposed to be discussing our homes	2643	A
oh it's a uh long story but uh let's discuss about our homes um what kind of home do you live in	2643	A
raised style	2643	A
uh-huh my parents live huh	2643	A
where did you got get there from	2643	A
all right	2643	A
i new you didn't have a Texas accent	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
i hear you	2643	A
i would imagine so	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh i would imagine	2643	A
so what kind of home do you live in	2643	A
oh a colonial style two story	2643	A
multistorey is what they call them	2643	A
okay	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
oh you work at TI	2643	A
so that's how you got hooked up to this	2643	A
you know you know you can converse with the person for a while and get to know them before you punch the one you don't have to get started on the conversation right away	2643	A
well anyway um well uh	2643	A
oh i don't know several eleven twelve thirteen i guess	2643	A
well i haven't made the calls mostly i've just uh i answered them i live in a two story type colonial here in Maryland	2643	A
yeah well most the homes here are two story because uh they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the Maryland area where i am	2643	A
yeah	2643	A
yeah well like i say the land here and depending on where you are and how crowded it is the land bays go up and here a little old measly quarter of an acre goes from anywhere from four to five thousand to a hundred and some odd thousand depending on where it is	2643	A
and if you're in a fairly decent subdivision which i guess maybe i'm in a fairly middle-class subdivision then	2643	A
the general trend is to put as much house as you can on a quarter acre it took me a long time to get used to it coming from down south up here	2643	A
big big houses on little bitty postage stamp lots	2643	A
but uh that's the general way they uh	2643	A
they build them here so you get about a twenty two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on whether you include the basement or not	2643	A
uh on about a quarter of an acre or less about ten thousand square feet	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
huh	2643	A
well they use slab foundations or do they use block foundations or the little	2643	A
crawl space	2643	A
okay slabs are easier and quicker to pour and lay i guess	2643	A
uh uh-huh	2643	A
i see what to dig out for it	2643	A
do you have high water tables	2643	A
so it's just a matter they just don't do it	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
well of course down there you probably don't have land as quite as much a premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out	2643	A
yeah yeah	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
i understand well uh you say you live in a ranch style house yourself	2643	A
well now	2643	A
is it like a split level	2643	A
in other words you've got some bedrooms above say a garage area and then the living room dining room area is halfway between both you go down steps to your garage and maybe a family room down there and you go up the steps to your bedroom	2643	A
okay that's what they call a split level up here and a split foyer is where all the steps are at the entrance way	2643	A
if you know what i mean	2643	A
that's a split foyer type and then uh a colonial is where they stack it on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the first floor like uh	2643	A
a family room or uh you know something like that and the dining room area and a living room and maybe a a kitchen with a possible little eat in area or something like that	2643	A
well uh you- i've been through two or three different things of them first house i came up here had gas heat with electric stove then the second house i owned had gas heat and gas stove and uh	2643	A
um even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater anyway and then the house i'm in now is all	2643	A
uh electric it even has a heat pump	2643	A
yeah and uh	2643	A
well heat pumps do work pretty well up here it's taking them a few years to get the bugs out of them but uh	2643	A
they they finally seem to work quite well and i would imagine down where you all live heat pumps will work quite well or maybe down there all you need is just air-conditioning that's all	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
well i would imagine all you need is just air-conditioning	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
oh that's right you're you're in the oil state so i would imagine there's plenty of gas around so that's the way to go for heat	2643	A
yeah	2643	A
uh-huh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it	2643	A
oh really	2643	A
uh-huh gas logs	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
uh	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
well i don't mind electric heating and and the like it's okay i mean i i like gas heat because it's so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking i cook- i just absolute think a gas stove's the best that money can buy	2643	A
you just can't beat cooking on gas	2643	A
that flame man is hard to beat because you can regulate it and i mean you you want to turn the flame down on the stove you turn it down right now you don't have to wait for a cool down time which you have to rely on with uh conventional stove or or a warm-up time i mean it's instantly there	2643	A
and that kind of response is quite uh quite effective i think for cooking	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
yeah	2643	A
well i've done without it too but i sure prefer it my wife does too	2643	A
yeah	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
well do your houses down there have porches or are they just pretty much like just a front door and that's it	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
yeah aren't they nice	2643	A
they're sort of coming back up here in the east	2643	A
front porches are they're not very big but they're kind of coming back	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh but i really love a screened in porch outback man i just eat that up	2643	A
huh	2643	A
well don't you all have mosquitoes down there	2643	A
really	2643	A
that's surprising	2643	A
hm	2643	A
how far are you guys from the coast down there where uh	2643	A
uh what is it uh	2643	A
oh are you that's a pretty good piece then	2643	A
i didn't know you were that far inland i knew it was a ways but	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
well tell me uh do your homes down there pretty much have garage disposals and things like that	2643	A
they do are y'all on septic or y'all have public sewage	2643	A
uh-huh	2643	A
oh they use one and two car garages or just one car garages or carports	2643	A
okay so they do go garage because i lived down south for a long time carports were real popular in certain areas where i	2643	A
used to live	2643	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2643	A
about how much floor space	2643	A
yeah that sounds about average i think all over the country	2643	A
yeah huh	2643	A
oh really i don't either i hate to clean the rascals i had a i had a pool outback behind my previous house one of those	2643	A
how did you all get tied up with this uh TI system	2643	B
yeah i just dial one	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
yeah but what- what uh what did you uh are you with TIer or how did you get tied up with this	2643	B
uh i guess a typical home here is without a uh uh basement i guess that's the classical uh	2643	B
yeah uh we have something here we have something here you may not have up there which is a well we we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof i don't know if you had it when i first got here	2643	B
from New Jersey	2643	B
uh	2643	B
right no i i'm my accent's gone i've practiced a long time to get rid of it uh	2643	B
the the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here they're very they're good for air-conditioning you know they they	2643	B
it's you it's very shocking when you look inside the attic and on a dry day	2643	B
and see a hundred little or thousands of little light wholes you know	2643	B
it it's very strange and then when of course when it rains then it then it then it stretches	2643	B
and does a pretty good job but uh the the fire hazard has is	2643	B
phasing that kind of construction out it it's so	2643	B
oh it's a rent it's a multistorey	2643	B
uh last year uh luckily	2643	B
no colonial is not the word had they use here uh that's	2643	B
a multilevel it's called multilevel	2643	B
it it it's not it's not really that typical it's a custom home	2643	B
uh i live in Arlington actually this i'm working tonight actually in Dallas uh	2643	B
at TI here	2643	B
oh yeah	2643	B
oh yeah	2643	B
oh yeah your right your right	2643	B
how many calls have you made uh have you	2643	B
oh really everyone everyone's higher than i am	2643	B
yeah that that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they don't use that word here	2643	B
do you have a basement	2643	B
oh yeah that's typical up there to you know	2643	B
oh yeah no the land is much cheaper here	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
yeah the lots aren't very big here either in the Dallas uh Fort Worth area	2643	B
uh but the basement there just aren't any basements i don't know of anyone ever even thought of putting a basement in here	2643	B
uh it used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your house but that's phased out in the last twenty five years where it's all slab	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
and uh they- they say that the the reason they don't put pier i think it's cheaper like you say but uh the soil does move a lot here and they say that you just couldn't uh	2643	B
put a basement in the soil but i'd think they just to me i don't know really know why it wouldn't work i think you can put a basement in anywhere it's just not not popular	2643	B
yeah really	2643	B
no no it's not very high some of the water here	2643	B
yeah this is Dallas there the water's down two thousand feet	2643	B
yeah i guess it's the style i really don't have an answer here because of the tornado i always thought tornados uh i thought people would build a lot of storm cellars you know or shelters you know but even that is not uh popular at all i don't know i don't know of anyone doing that uh	2643	B
uh i don't even see it in the newspaper where people advertise that they have uh storm cellars or anything they just don't have them period	2643	B
yeah it's it's multilevel yeah like my garage i have uh uh a bedroom over	2643	B
split level yeah	2643	B
right	2643	B
right exactly	2643	B
right	2643	B
right right	2643	B
yeah yeah	2643	B
what's your typical heating up there in Maryland gas or	2643	B
uh-huh	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
oh really	2643	B
well heat pumps nice up there it would probably work pretty well	2643	B
yeah that's true	2643	B
well they should yeah because it's warmer in the winter or you have less of a winter down here of course it's a short winter but it does get down to five degrees uh occasionally	2643	B
but uh i don't really know if heat pumps are that popular yet i guess uh i don't i haven't been that close to it in the newer homes	2643	B
yeah we we have heat uh some have air-conditioning units i i i have an all electric house but uh it's fifty fifty there's a lot of gas houses here uh because it's so popular	2643	B
oh yeah	2643	B
people i think probably prefer natural gas for for heating	2643	B
i don't i'm an engineer and i don't like the danger of it i've seen too many houses here blowup and i think yeah and i just think	2643	B
when i had- i had uh a gas uh	2643	B
uh fireplace you know i had and i saw the way it was constructed- yeah it went over my daughter's bedrooms you know over the garage i thought and there's there's just too many fittings in this thing to leak and so i just disconnected- i never did hook that sucker up so i just took it out completely	2643	B
although people love gas here but i i'm ultraconservative on safety and i just don't don't want it	2643	B
yeah well i've heard people-	2643	B
yeah i've heard people say that i and i	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
right	2643	B
oh yeah no i i've i've known people love it for years and uh but uh we've done without it for twenty years here and and uh	2643	B
yeah yeah no i i haven't i haven't really noticed uh i don't miss it you know with our of course i'm against i'm just i'm one of the	2643	B
a million people that uh is against uh gas	2643	B
no	2643	B
no there's not much in front there's no sitting out front you know there's no like like in the east when i was young	2643	B
of course it goes way back we used to sit out front i had a porch up front but no there's not a porch	2643	B
yeah yeah oh yeah	2643	B
i i i wish i had that you know	2643	B
right i i think the old ways in a lot of uh ways should come back uh	2643	B
but no the	2643	B
yeah no that there it's not popular here either screens in screen in is not that that's so that's uh	2643	B
not like not like you have up there no	2643	B
it's too dry it's so dry that it's uh	2643	B
Dallas is super dry	2643	B
uh three hundred miles yeah	2643	B
yeah	2643	B
our our weather is like we have a we have a the warm- raining season is now is April	2643	B
and a little bit of May an then it goes into super dry all summer then you summer with a hurricane season but uh	2643	B
yeah yeah they have everything	2643	B
no public there's essentially no septic not in Dallas Fort Worth though you have it in the out lying areas but uh	2643	B
two two	2643	B
no not carports uh it's essentially garages	2643	B
yeah not Dallas uh Fort Worth is you know the two car garage and certainly all air-conditioned uh	2643	B
uh uh two thousand square feet is probably i don't know if that's average or not yeah	2643	B
uh uh i think so too there's a lot of swimming pools here i don't have one uh	2643	B
uh-huh my mother used to work at the Plano location i think she moved back down into closer into Dallas	2659	A
so okay let me let me hit one hold on a second here	2659	A
okay	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
um okay uh my favorite i have a lot of favorites i like to try a lot of different things uh	2659	A
there's very few foods that i don't like i don't like asparagus and beets and anything else i can pretty much eat uh recently i went to a French restaurant and i had something called uh spinach fettucini and crawfish	2659	A
uh in this particular French restaurant was our problem to be going back again and again uh they there were three waiters that waited on the entire restaurant they just all kept an eye on all the tables	2659	A
and something that really impressed me was that i asked one waiter for butter	2659	A
and then the next second another- a different waiter brought the butter out as and and they hadn't even talked or anything and it was it was really amazing and so that really impresses me the service in a restaurant	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
exactly	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
and that's probably not a chain restaurant	2659	A
i find that most most family owned restaurant or or single restaurant you get the best service simply because that restaurant belongs to somebody it it it has the family name on it	2659	A
and so whoever's in there is going to take care of you as opposed to going into a chain restaurant where they're just hiring you know people out of that really don't probably don't care too much about the establishment so they're not going to worry about taking care of you	2659	A
whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that you know has been working there for twenty years or so they want they want you to be happy so you get the service and you know of course with that will come the good food	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
exactly	2659	A
exactly	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
exactly the guy that took me out to this French restaurant he works in a hotel nearby and he just happened to mention to the waiter that he sends a lot of the people from the hotel over to the guy's restaurant	2659	A
and and at the end of our meal you know we're ready to go and we're full and this guy sends us a platter of each dessert	2659	A
just because we looked so weird at the dessert you know but that that was	2659	A
exactly	2659	A
exactly exactly	2659	A
um one of my favorite restaurants is Steak and Ale now that's a chain sort of a chain restaurant	2659	A
but they seem to i like i like atmosphere myself and and their food is good and i really like the salad bar and that that gets me into a restaurant if there is really good salad bar because i love salads and soups and things like that	2659	A
right right	2659	A
i would-	2659	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2659	A
did you just recently try it uh-huh	2659	A
yeah	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
all right	2659	A
wow maybe i need to get me a wok and have some people over	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
right right	2659	A
um	2659	A
probably that it heats up real good and uh-huh	2659	A
um	2659	A
and that was on a television advertisement one of them nineteen ninety five deals yeah okay	2659	A
that sounds good yeah i don't like i've tried probably just about everything just because i don't like to	2659	A
you know i don't i hate one thing i hate to do in a restaurant is to be with someone that want try things	2659	A
because i'm also wanting to anything that they have i will try and uh you know sometimes i may not like it but i feel like i miss out you know if i had gone a long time without trying Chinese food i would have had to try it one day just because you know i hate to miss out	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
yeah yeah the little crunchy things i never know what they are i just call them the crunchers	2659	A
so	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
um	2659	A
that sounds good i love catfish	2659	A
uh-huh and i love shrimp	2659	A
and-	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
uh	2659	A
right right	2659	A
um yeah i don't like scallops too much their they have kind a funny taste i can eat them but they're	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
hum yeah	2659	A
yeah	2659	A
yeah i'm originally from New York i grew up there so i got to eat a lot of uh i mean just fresh fresh i mean one	2659	A
one day we were out just driving and they are always uh oriental people with their little stands	2659	A
and they're selling things and we decided we were going to buy this thing we didn't know what it was we got in the car and opened it up and started eating it and it was really really good and we figured out that it was octopus	2659	A
uh harbors are and things	2659	A
yeah	2659	A
yeah yeah	2659	A
there's not a whole lot of taste it's just basically meat and there's not a lot of taste not a lot to eat not to like you know so unless you think it's bland or something	2659	A
um ah	2659	A
now that's something i may not try yeah i've heard that's good i've heard frog legs are good i haven't had any of those yet so i'll have to try those one day	2659	A
uh-huh exactly that's	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
right	2659	A
hum	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
right right	2659	A
um i think my favorite meat is lamb	2659	A
no i think i think it's it's got a i like the texture of it is why i like it not so much taste but the texture- it's not real chewy or	2659	A
i mean it's just real good to me i can't really describe why but	2659	A
yeah i like veal too	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
um	2659	A
uh-huh	2659	A
um i bet	2659	A
just outside of Dallas	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
okeydoke well punch one we'll get started	2659	B
okay-	2659	B
-okay i guess my my favorite eating out uh food is Mexican food	2659	B
Tex-Mex not real Mexican food	2659	B
that real Mexican food is too hot	2659	B
hum	2659	B
huh	2659	B
uh-huh	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah well i i like a restaurant- i like a restaurant that uh	2659	B
not necessarily for atmosphere you know uh the atmosphere isn't worth a dime if the food's no good and the service is lousy	2659	B
and this little old Mexican restaurant we have right up here from the house i i don't guess it'll hold more than twenty people	2659	B
and it's just a little small restaurant pardon me and it's uh just kind of like a hole in the wall but the food is excellent	2659	B
and and the service is excellent and the price is very reasonable	2659	B
it's not a chain it's a little a family owned restaurant	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
right	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah plus you you can go in after you've	2659	B
you've uh uh gone to the place quite a few times uh they get to know you and uh uh you know appreciate you and say hello to you and how are you doing and	2659	B
and all you got to do is sit down and say we'll have our usual	2659	B
and uh you know it's just it's real nice and	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
um	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
plus you go you go to a big fancy restaurant and uh	2659	B
uh some of the price that you pay for the meal is strictly for the decor and for the atmosphere and you can't eat that	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
and i guess it depends you know if if it's just you and your husband going out to eat uh unless it's uh anniversary or something like that atmosphere doesn't mean that much but if you're taking another couple or taking	2659	B
relatives or friends or something you want the place you know to be nice	2659	B
but uh and also we we uh	2659	B
i i wasn't too much on Chinese food until i tried it and i really liked it	2659	B
and i even bought me a wok and doing my own doing my own Chinese cooking now but	2659	B
uh-huh yeah we've tried it a couple times and and even had uh uh relatives over and i cooked some out of that and boy they just lapped it up	2659	B
but uh	2659	B
we saw this one advertised on TV it's uh uh real real good wok it's a hand hand uh	2659	B
pounded not hand carved hound hand made of iron	2659	B
it's not one of these aluminum or steel woks that you buy	2659	B
heats up real good and the the uh meat and stuff doesn't stick to it like it will uh uh aluminum or uh stainless steel	2659	B
uh-huh	2659	B
yeah yeah	2659	B
and it uh	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
well i love- i love those fried vegetables	2659	B
especially the uh watercress and the crunchy	2659	B
the crunchy ones	2659	B
yeah huh yeah we like uh we like seafood too and we found a little ole another little ole hole in the wall that makes excellent fried catfish	2659	B
boy it's good	2659	B
yeah i do too	2659	B
we haven't tried any of their seafood and we again had some relatives here last week and we went took them there she had never had catfish- she was from Connecticut	2659	B
and uh she had never had channel catfish	2659	B
and she tried the scallops i asked her if they were any good because i new the scallops were probably oh you know not local like catfish is	2659	B
but uh she said they were very good	2659	B
and she	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
well being from Connecticut they're they're use to fresh seafood like shrimp and lobster and stuff like that	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
hm	2659	B
uh-huh	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
i never have tried octopus it sounds- it looks like it would be good because it's all meat there's no bones to it it's not	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
yeah one of these days i would like to try a rattlesnake too i've heard that it's delicious	2659	B
but uh	2659	B
oh i love frog legs	2659	B
yeah frog frog legs are good of course you know you ask somebody what meat taste like just about any meat you ask them had a it taste like they say like chicken	2659	B
but uh it does it's similar to chicken but the meat	2659	B
the meat is sweeter	2659	B
and if you've ever i use to go frog gigging as a kid and gigging the frogs and then uh and get their legs	2659	B
and the meat is it's crystal clear meat it's beautiful meat	2659	B
now it is a little bits stringy	2659	B
uh because of uh because simply they're frog legs because they you know they have the muscles and so forth	2659	B
but it's it's it's sweet meat	2659	B
now i don't i don't care a whole lot about lamb	2659	B
yeah yeah	2659	B
yeah	2659	B
lamb or veal i'm not real crazy over it	2659	B
but uh while i was i i've worked for Texas Instruments out in Ridgecrest California for eight years and one time we went down to uh Bakersfield	2659	B
and there was a Basque restaurant B A S Q U E	2659	B
and uh we stopped there and ate and i wish i could find another one here	2659	B
oh it was good they serve it family style everything in	2659	B
okay_1	2689	B
what can we do about crime i don't know the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records	2689	B
so maybe we need to have more	2689	B
prisons or use the old army bases and make them_1 into prisons or something that's one thing i guess i could think of	2689	B
uh it's definitely a big concern i mean every day it's you know all are even- we live in a little small town and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time and you just can't get away from it no matter where you live	2689	B
so it's pretty scary	2689	B
um-hum	2689	B
yeah	2689	B
yeah it's rough because_1	2689	B
yeah	2689	B
yeah well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous i mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries and they're still you know only serving six months in prison	2689	B
so that's definitely something they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like you know from one month to ten years or something	2689	B
that would be one thing that you know i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties you know for certain crimes	2689	B
yeah	2689	B
yeah and one things that they're saying now are you going are you a student or are you in the work force or	2689	B
oh okay because one of the things that i've heard so much about lately- um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much and apparently many of the	2689	B
especially like in date rape many of the um you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up and they don't really	2689	B
oh yeah	2689	B
yeah yeah	2689	B
yeah	2689	B
yeah they say like only one in ten are reported i believe it	2689	B
that's it's awful so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing but	2689	B
i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it so that's probably something else they could do	2689	B
i don't know it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs you know and that's like as long as it- it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know because_1 these kids are saying why should i go	2689	B
to high school and so i can go out and work at Burger King you know for four dollars an hour or whatever when i can make uh four hundred dollars a day selling drugs	2689	B
so that's certainly a big problem i don't know what the solution to that is having more drug treatment centers available jeez i don't know	2689	B
yeah	2689	B
yeah because it ends up even if it's just kind of like this social drug use you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin you know	2689	B
huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent you know on higher and higher up on drugs and it's definitely	2689	B
got to do with crime you know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack i mean just oh gosh horrible stuff like that one of the things they're doing is is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack	2689	B
they said um some of the statistics- statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack and their moms are crack users	2689	B
so that's you know another way of looking at it as as the woman is being a criminal you know for doing that to her child	2689	B
so i don't know who's the victim there i mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because_1 they're addicted and	2689	B
it's a very complicated problem i don't envy the government trying to cope with it gosh	2689	B
yeah	2689	B
well i guess that's about all i have to say is there anything else you would want to	2689	B
okay	2689	B
yeah	2689	B
yeah yeah it's frustrating	2689	B
okay well thanks for talking have a good day bye bye	2689	B
okay	2689	A
uh-huh	2689	A
um-hum	2689	A
yeah	2689	A
well i i'm i'm from Butler and i can't say that there's too much of that there um	2689	A
i know the bigger cities have problems with it	2689	A
uh i really don't know what we can do about it	2689	A
unless they start enforcing the um	2689	A
um-hum	2689	A
yeah	2689	A
i i don't- i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because_1 it just keeps getting worse and worse	2689	A
um i'm a senior at Clarion University	2689	A
well not only that a lot of them's not even turned in	2689	A
you know what i mean a lot of times the girls don't even report it	2689	A
um i've heard of a few cases up here but i can't say that i've heard of uh you know any significant amount uh but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not	2689	A
um-hum	2689	A
um-hum	2689	A
yeah	2689	A
<b_aside> do you want to sit down <e_aside>	2689	A
uh	2689	A
see see now i would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything i know a lot of people	2689	A
that partake in that and i'm not saying they're bad people but i- i- i would say that's a bigger problem	2689	A
um-hum	2689	A
uh-huh	2689	A
uh-huh	2689	A
no i don't either	2689	A
uh no i can't say that i- i just know that it's really bad in some areas and something's going to have to be done sooner but	2689	A
i don't i don't know what they can do	2689	A
um-hum	2689	A
well it was nice talking to you uh you too bye	2689	A
um well what do you think is uh the pollutants the main pollutants in the air	2648	A
yeah that's me too after um on channel thirteen uh they had some	2648	A
some programs the day before and i'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and	2648	A
you know how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do as the people and and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot and that actually um	2648	A
as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem but also like you said	2648	A
the industry pollution and you know they're regulation- they're regulation that's placed on them is	2648	A
i mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they still don't have you know they don't they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air	2648	A
you know i i just i can't stand that and i know for a fact	2648	A
that they get away with a lot that you know they're supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant i don't know about TI but we have a plant uh a Pillsbury plant	2648	A
in in a town adjacent to ours and i know people that work there that of course you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals	2648	A
but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the um	2648	A
what they do uh to uh make their dough and stuff- to	2648	A
clean out the flour and stuff like that yeah i mean it's incredible and um	2648	A
they said that they're you know they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming	2648	A
they you know shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're that they're dumping things	2648	A
that they're not supposed to be dumping and i'm like if they're getting away with it	2648	A
can you imagine that's a that's a Pillsbury plant i can't imagine plants	2648	A
yeah they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down and then they they also do testing there and i don't you know when- when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be	2648	A
can be anything that's uh classified that can damage the Earth	2648	A
so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that {chemicalwise} that they use to uh that they are testing with	2648	A
that they're dumping	2648	A
yeah	2648	A
yeah i don't think they do the packaging at this plant but they do they do a lot of research and they do um they do do a lot of the refining up there or i'm not really what's it called when you do flour i'm not	2648	A
yeah	2648	A
yeah but	2648	A
uh-huh	2648	A
yeah	2648	A
but i mean you think about it it you know it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is	2648	A
maybe to just i'm not really sure but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down stream or stream or such or you can you can you know do uh testing on the ground itself at that point	2648	A
but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off so i don't see	2648	A
you know how they can do some of the tests- unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in Los Angeles or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air	2648	A
you know per per uh per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away	2648	A
but um	2648	A
uh-huh	2648	A
yeah well i know out in some i'm not sure	2648	A
i can't remember the name of the county it's it's where Stillwater is or	2648	A
Sweet no i'm not sure i know it i think it's uh i know we have a piece property there it's called Dublin it's in Dublin Texas i'm not really sure what the county it's Stephen no Stephenville	2648	A
okay where Stephenville's at they've had a lot of problems because they've um introduced a lot of dairies there	2648	A
so they have a lot of cattle in the area i mean they've got like per per yard- uh per lot	2648	A
you know they've got like a lot of head of cattle	2648	A
because_1 dairies they don't the- the- it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like	2648	A
a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure	2648	A
one cow i was like my God and they and this thing says that that you know if- people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not	2648	A
when you know you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down and and this	2648	A
and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is what it's doing is it's going through uh they don't have a very deep um oh	2648	A
you know they're water	2648	A
they're natural water uh	2648	A
i forget what that's called with you know it's like a spring spring water but it's below the surface it's not very far down	2648	A
and all this stuff is seeping through to the water and they're like they're afraid that you know within a certain amount of years	2648	A
that it's they're water- they're water in that town will be totally polluted and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have um polluted	2648	A
completely polluted so that they're you know there's too many toxins and bacterial growth and i'm like my God you know	2648	A
just from that one you know just from them introducing dairy farms in that one county	2648	A
no not when you figure i didn't realize a cow one cow produces that much manure and they were talking like	2648	A
thousands of cows you know they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area you	2648	A
well they are evidently but um i mean even- evidently a normal cow produces that much too	2648	A
but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not you know a problem	2648	A
but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they've got a real big problem and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to uh these	2648	A
like ponds that they had to filter it with but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow and they overflow into the the creeks and stuff in the area	2648	A
so that just creates you know there there's and oh it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam people people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all and i'm just like oh my gosh and the smell is really bad they say	2648	A
yeah but i i don't know it really frightens me though as far as the	2648	A
when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself and then and channel thirteen they're really um	2648	A
emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for um	2648	A
just the the Earth you know what the Earth is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's going to come down at	2648	A
yeah	2648	A
the rain forest and all	2648	A
yeah	2648	A
well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we can't synthesize it and they're synthesizing it for us	2648	A
yeah	2648	A
yeah i think we just have to i don't know personally you know i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is	2648	A
is working properly and you you know they're suppose nowadays they have the emission controls on them but	2648	A
uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the legislators'- your legislators' back	2648	A
you know as far as	2648	A
seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying okay we're really going to get involved it it's really becoming a problem by the year two thousand there will what what are we going to have what kind of results are we going to have for the environment and	2648	A
and what will we	2648	A
right	2648	B
um	2648	B
i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that i just uh i think they put off so much and they're not regulated enough	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
right	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
no	2648	B
really	2648	B
huh	2648	B
oh	2648	B
right	2648	B
i wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could would the i mean or even had chemicals- you know well	2648	B
those chemicals would not	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
right yeah	2648	B
right you know like in	2648	B
in packaging and uh you know just goodness	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
uh	2648	B
only thing i can think is bleaching but i mean i i don't know what's how they do the flour	2648	B
but um we we're on the southwest side of Houston we don't have that much as far as uh any of the plants over on this uh the west- east side does	2648	B
we've got Imperial sugar but uh	2648	B
and they're you know they're right there on the creek also and uh they've been there for years	2648	B
and uh	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
right yeah	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
i know that i worry every now and then we're still on a well water we're not on city water	2648	B
and i think well what if somebody's dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and you know it sinked in through the ground and all that	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
oh okay okay	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
right uh-huh	2648	B
oh	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
oh	2648	B
it will	2648	B
uh-huh yeah and the ground-	2648	B
right	2648	B
right	2648	B
yeah and the the ground will filter some of it but not all of it	2648	B
these are well fed	2648	B
these are	2648	B
good grief these are well fed cows uh	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
right	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
oh	2648	B
oh now that's bad	2648	B
right i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
yeah	2648	B
right right and then cutting the trees you know that bothers me	2648	B
as far as you know	2648	B
yes uh	2648	B
we've been wanting to well not me but uh it's been recommended- or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here i'm like no you know you know for what's cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else and	2648	B
it will just take that longer to grow back and trees help so that uh	2648	B
i don't-	2648	B
uh-huh they	2648	B
right right believe me it's just so much better	2648	B
so uh yeah i knew i think there's lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
uh-huh	2648	B
right	2648	B
well we got two Cocker Spaniels at the house uh a female and a and a male and at the office i have tropical fish how about yourself	3622	B
meow meow cats	3622	B
my sister and her husband had cat and it was kind of an alley cat and it kept going out in the alley and getting pregnant	3622	B
and it looked kind of like a Persian cat but anyway went and got pregnant the first time they advertised in the newspaper free kittens and and nobody would come over and do anything	3622	B
and then they changed to ad to read Persian like kittens thirty five dollars and they were gone in one day	3622	B
we let our female uh get pregnant as a matter of fact it's AKC so we reached out for a stud	3622	B
and when the the uh puppies arrived we made sure the children were there to see it uh we thought it was a	3622	B
very simple uh	3622	B
course in birth	3622	B
birds and the bees and uh	3622	B
the dog has had two litters and i'm glad the children experienced the process uh	3622	B
i didn't see anything wrong with it	3622	B
um-hum	3622	B
huh	3622	B
well we nearly lost a dog the second time she had a litter we didn't get her on vitamins soon enough	3622	B
some distressed children uh the dog was just the hindquarters wouldn't work so we ran to the vet one Sunday morning believe it or not they've got twenty four hour vets in emergency clinics and they they charge	3622	B
charge like that too	3622	B
and uh he said well there's three things and he said well that's not it the second one that's not by the time he got to second that's not the kid's were in the lobby just crying their heads off	3622	B
and the third one got corrected the dog and we saved the dog thank goodness it just it didn't have the right vitamins to keep it going with the the puppies draining her milk	3622	B
so we enjoy dogs because uh they kind of bark when someone shouldn't be around the house we do not let them in the house at all but they're outside dogs and uh	3622	B
what are your cats do they uh meow at all if some stranger comes	3622	B
do do do they actually kill mice	3622	B
ooh	3622	B
killed it	3622	B
well we've got a pet rabbit in the house i forgot to mention that and uh	3622	B
when we've been having a fence put in the dog got to the rabbit and it was no longer a live rabbit	3622	B
have you heard about people that house train their rabbits	3622	B
well this is our we do too it's in a cage but people-	3622	B
kind of pets you got	3622	A
fish in the office may dad used to have fish in his office years ago	3622	A
we've got three cats	3622	A
meow meow cats	3622	A
that's that's exactly what they do we got we've got um one that's about three and a half and he's black and white	3622	A
and one that's three and she's all white although she's a little dirty now and then we got one that's a year old and is what they call tortoise- tortoise hair which is kind of multi	3622	A
multicolored and um	3622	A
she's the one that's most vocal i think	3622	A
free market it worked well all all our cats have been uh have been neutered or spayed or what have you our white cat has	3622	A
got some Persian like qualities and big and it's and it's very long haired	3622	A
which makes it look even bigger the other two are short haired cats	3622	A
as i said we're we're not going to end up with any kittens we figured we had two other cats before these both of one of which died from old age	3622	A
it was about um fourteen and a half	3622	A
and then one died very young from feline leukemia years ago when they didn't you know now they've got shots for feline leukemia but back when this cat died	3622	A
which was oh some ten years ago they didn't have feline leukemia shots so	3622	A
so it got ill then it got better and then it got ill and died immediately so	3622	A
oh my	3622	A
well i don't think so but they're inside	3622	A
um part of the time outside part of the time and um	3622	A
oh i don't know they uh	3622	A
well they're not watch cats or anything but i tell you what we don't have any mice or or any uh rodents or anything like that they	3622	A
they certainly keep things uh neat and clean things stay away	3622	A
uh well at one time we know we've had cats that have killed mice and most of time unfortunately they end up killing birds	3622	A
and they'll leave us a present on the back or front step and there'll be a bird	3622	A
missing a head or you know whatever but uh we got in at least once i saw cat- one of the cats not this cat but one of them that's now died that that had a had a mouse and one time one of the cats got a a rabbit that was in the backyard	3622	A
no uh we got it to let go the rabbit we heard this horrible shrill noise and didn't know what it was and it was a rabbit screaming for it life so we went out there and convinced the cat to let go of the rabbit	3622	A
oh my well i we where over to a friend's house they had a pet rabbit and this pet rabbit looks just like our white cat we always called the white cat a big rabbit and the fact of it the cat and the rabbit looked pretty similar	3622	A
these people had their rabbits outside	3622	A
what vacations have you been on that you like	3628	A
right	3628	A
uh-huh	3628	A
so you- mostly yours is kind of driving and	3628	A
um	3628	A
how how far uh do you usually end- end up driving just	3628	A
now where you're from where	3628	A
oh Wisconsin okay	3628	A
yeah i have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin	3628	A
so yeah that's quite a ways	3628	A
i've uh	3628	A
we went to California this last year and uh liked it but it was too crowded Walt Disney World and	3628	A
all those places it's just the wrong time of the year to go	3628	A
and uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's uh outrageously priced and uh	3628	A
kind of you wonder if they're it's really worth it to pay uh thirty five dollars or forty dollars just to get in	3628	A
but	3628	A
there's lots of fun places to see um i think the scenery kind of that's something do to you like to get up in mountains or	3628	A
do you have any mountains nearby	3628	A
it's pretty flat isn't it	3628	A
um i think uh	3628	A
the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it	3628	A
what vacation have you enjoyed the most	3628	A
what is it	3628	A
okay	3628	A
uh-huh	3628	A
probably a city in itself kind of like huh	3628	A
summer place how far away is it	3628	A
huh	3628	A
okay sure	3628	A
sure	3628	A
right well and you could probably you're in a climate that's kind of humid so you have probably a lot of green and	3628	A
a lot of real pretty things our our climate's real dry and	3628	A
you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery most of the most most the land's pretty brown you don't have as much of the greenery like you have	3628	A
uh Idaho is where i live and uh yes	3628	A
it's by uh i have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that i'm on the phone it's by um Boise you ever heard of Boise and uh it's fun it's nice it's uh	3628	A
it's lot different kind of i lived in Indiana for a while and it's a real different uh	3628	A
land and scenery than there it's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and	3628	A
things like that i think uh	3628	A
there's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern Utah the canyons canyon lands and Bryce Canyon and	3628	A
oh boy they're gorgeous Lake Tahoe	3628	A
those are kind of fun places we usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer which is uh	3628	A
kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah and the lake goes on forever and that's real pretty over there too	3628	A
but i think i'm kind of a summer vacationer	3628	A
right	3628	A
right	3628	A
when'd you try and	3628	A
um	3628	B
well i really enjoyed um i went to Mackinaw Island	3628	B
a few years back it's in the middle of- Lake Michigan	3628	B
and so that was nice i like um driving to a different cities because of the scenery	3628	B
so that was nice	3628	B
yeah we've i've been all over the states except for pretty much east	3628	B
um it's very pretty driving like um up north in Wisconsin too	3628	B
um the furthest i drove was probably	3628	B
Texas and then i've taken a train before to California	3628	B
Kenosha Wisconsin	3628	B
um-hum	3628	B
oh	3628	B
yeah it is	3628	B
um-hum	3628	B
oh	3628	B
oh yeah	3628	B
um-hum	3628	B
yeah that's true	3628	B
oh yeah um-hum	3628	B
no	3628	B
yeah yeah	3628	B
oh yeah	3628	B
yeah	3628	B
um	3628	B
probably uh when we go to Wisconsin Dells	3628	B
um it's pretty fun there's a lot to do up there it's pretty busy though you have to like crowds you know i	3628	B
um oh it's uh	3628	B
like a huge amusement park um they have water slides	3628	B
and it's just a big big tourist attraction there's the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops and	3628	B
it's it's really neat i don't think uh hardly anybody lives there because it's just kind of like you know tourists	3628	B
yeah it's mostly a a summer summer place	3628	B
um from Kenosha it's about three hours	3628	B
it's about a hour away from Madison	3628	B
yeah so that's nice it's it's pretty ride up there too i really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin it's really pretty	3628	B
it's nice out there i- i like all the nature things there are to look at you know	3628	B
where is that	3628	B
oh where is that	3628	B
i don't twenty five oh okay	3628	B
oh yeah yeah	3628	B
yeah	3628	B
oh do that yeah	3628	B
oh	3628	B
yeah i do	3628	B
oh yeah me too uh me too unless i'm going somewhere warm for the winter yeah that'd be nice	3628	B
um	3649	B
oh yeah now that one's a fun one that that is fun i know that sometimes i've the one that's been hard for me is the one that the Skidmores used to do at Christmas time	3649	B
and i i think its just because it was i seem to always be bad weather and i'm just going over the	3649	B
you know the yeah its just right after Christmas that one was kind of hard i think that was a hard time but	3649	B
well they haven't since his grandmother died and i don't know if you know they they just continued it kind of while	3649	B
she was still alive and	3649	B
and uh just nobody's done anything about it since she passed away but i don't know i mean it was always nice but it was just kind of a hard time i think	3649	B
yeah um yeah my my side of the family usually has let's see i went to one at that was at my um actually it was in Layton and it was up my father's	3649	B
grandfather's house where his mother had been raised a little bit of the time they've- they've still got this old home in their family and	3649	B
and that uh uh it was really a fun one that was nice to get to know a lot of the people though that we don't know and we just had a big	3649	B
um they had big grill that they cooked chicken and what'd they have chicken and i guess ribs and then they just did they had a little program and they made a quilt and gave it away	3649	B
um well they they um i think they drew names is what they did	3649	B
people well no they did auction it well people bought a ticket that's how they did it and then the person with the winning ticket got it and things like that and that was kind of a fun one yeah	3649	B
no we just goof off just play yeah	3649	B
oh uh-huh	3649	B
now- now is that the same time of year	3649	B
no	3649	B
okay because i it's is that kind of a family reunion too yeah yeah	3649	B
oh i see oh and	3649	B
uh-huh	3649	B
yeah	3649	B
oh that's nice- nice yeah	3649	B
we have they've organized a um like a family i don't know just some family organization on my dad's side and we do we pay dues	3649	B
i think this year we just paid like ten dollars and and then they sent have started sending out a news letter on people and and um you know somebody's gone to a lot of work and they've they're doing a real good job and	3649	B
and so oh yeah i'm not good at things like that so	3649	B
it is it is and i know there's been a lot of years we haven't gone and then when we do go it doesn't seem like we know anybody and so i think it is good to keep going and	3649	B
and keep those family ties up	3649	B
yeah	3649	B
oh	3649	B
yeah but that's that is kind of sad when uh nobody does want to do it yeah	3649	B
oh it is it is oh well and and so you just you have the two on	3649	B
either side but you didn't have the one this year is this the first year you didn't have it on your husband's side	3649	B
oh i see oh	3649	B
huh	3649	B
uh-huh	3649	B
oh	3649	B
huh	3649	B
i don't know i've never heard that one before	3649	B
you you say how many calls have you made-	3649	B
oh do you have very many family reunions that one you have over to Bear Lake is the grandfather of all of them isn't it	3649	A
oh	3649	A
oh uh-huh	3649	A
mountains uh-huh	3649	A
oh they don't have that anymore	3649	A
oh	3649	A
uh-huh do you have any other reunions	3649	A
oh	3649	A
um-hum	3649	A
hum	3649	A
they didn't auction it or anything	3649	A
oh oh uh-huh	3649	A
oh	3649	A
with the one up to the up to Bear Lake do you uh do anything like genealogy or or anything like that	3649	A
oh uh my family goes up to uh Cub River up to Willow Flat	3649	A
for three days every year i mean it's there's not as much to do up as there is up at Bear Lake but we just go and camp out and wade in the river and	3649	A
no that's the fourth of July one that we go down to the cabin	3649	A
uh-huh uh-huh yeah but but that's but the one that we go up to Bear Lake with my family is	3649	A
the more- more people come it's my father's and mother's children that go to that one	3649	A
so but and then we have a great big Johnson one about- every other year that we make- that we make a quilt and sell it	3649	A
and then we'll- we'll sell chances on it and then that pays for all of the mailing and everything that's concerned with it yeah it does it works out really good	3649	A
oh uh-huh	3649	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3649	A
just wait till it falls in your lap huh neither- am i but it's really important i think to keep those connections	3649	A
yeah	3649	A
uh-huh	3649	A
uh-huh	3649	A
well i i don't know we've the Waites had a reunion too but that that fell- every other every other year but that fell through because people just wouldn't take charge and do it	3649	A
so and maybe there's a time to let go too	3649	A
i don't know i	3649	A
uh-huh	3649	A
but then people get involved in other things and involved in others you know but i think it's really important to keep the your generation and the earlier generation together	3649	A
so	3649	A
uh-huh	3649	A
we had a we had the the the one the small one and then for his too we have a great big Christmas party every year	3649	A
and- and then the the summer one fourth of around the fourth of July	3649	A
but the the i don't know they those are are just his immediate family	3649	A
they're not extended- it's not extended	3649	A
is that say we have to quit	3649	A
okay all set	3624	A
let's see music um well i play a couple of instruments i try to um clarinet's my primary instrument and i also play a little bit of saxophone flute and piano	3624	A
when i get the opportunity which isn't very often	3624	A
but um	3624	A
how about_1 yourself	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
wow	3624	A
oh wow	3624	A
wow that's great	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
um-hum	3624	A
so are you a professional musician	3624	A
no	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
uh-huh	3624	A
uh-huh i understand yeah i'm in one community band here and that's just well we rehearse once a week we generally have a concert every other week	3624	A
and	3624	A
yeah	3624	A
no we sure don't	3624	A
well one thing is we have a summer series- summer series and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little	3624	A
out- outdoor stage set up and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer yeah and then i don't know we just have an awful lot of engagements and we're just having to turn a lot of people down	3624	A
um because_1 you know uh we don't wanna do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row	3624	A
oh yes definitely we really do	3624	A
so	3624	A
uh it really depends on who shows up	3624	A
um and it's always a mystery because it actually doesn't matter who shows up it matters what instruments they brought because so many people switch instruments so often	3624	A
but um yeah in the winter we do more concert stuff and	3624	A
um i think there's about seventy	3624	A
yeah there's a lot but on any given night there's not seventy you know it- it alternates quite a lot	3624	A
yeah it really is	3624	A
well	3624	A
yeah	3624	A
well	3624	A
oh okay	3624	A
um-hum	3624	A
um-hum	3624	A
um-hum	3624	A
um-hum yeah	3624	A
um-hum um-hum	3624	A
yeah that's fun	3624	A
well let's see well there's another band around here someone- someone at work is trying to get me to join that one because_1 they need clarinet players	3624	A
and their concert schedule isn't as heavy but they have more in the summer i think they have ten in the summer you know one one week after the other i think they're like Monday nights	3624	A
and they don't have rehearsals during that time period	3624	A
uh well it's not really sight reading when you've done it you know again and again and again but some people are yeah some of them are	3624	A
um well they're in the suburbs of Dallas in Richardson and Plano	3624	A
real real close to Dallas	3624	A
uh	3624	A
yeah well it's more of a i think it's very much more of a social group than anything else you know	3624	A
um and- and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so and that's probably why we get so many people	3624	A
um well the conductor gets paid a little bit you know we we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events um	3624	A
i think he's the only one that gets paid um	3624	A
the city uh-huh	3624	A
yeah it's a similar thing i can't remember what they call it but the same type of thing um but we do get an awful lot of music you know we can borrow music from any of the area colleges	3624	A
or you know if if some some group just isn't gonna play anymore they'll just give us their music and that type of thing	3624	A
and we do an awful lot of you know we don't charge for any of our performances but we get a lot of donations	3624	A
so yeah	3624	A
good morning	3624	B
um-hum what do you play	3624	B
uh-huh	3624	B
really that's too bad i'm	3624	B
i play uh the violin and play trumpet	3624	B
and i run a municipal band and i sometimes conduct	3624	B
so i'm pretty busy too i play in three different symphony orchestras	3624	B
we have a nice big one here in State College called the Nitny Valley Symphony	3624	B
i play in the Altoona Symphony was about forty- forty five miles away	3624	B
and i play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven uh Symphony and Community Orchestra	3624	B
and	3624	B
no i'm uh just retiring from Penn State University	3624	B
i mean i i should've should've been i spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere	3624	B
but uh i've been working at uh Penn State	3624	B
and using up all my nighttimes and weekends	3624	B
and i go in to these orchestra rehearsals and and concerts and so forth	3624	B
you have one that often	3624	B
that's amazing because i uh i have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert	3624	B
wowie	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
you are busy	3624	B
where where- where do you get all this music i mean you- you must back up play some of the music twice	3624	B
oh okay so your you don't uh play a pretty well a full concert band music most of the time huh	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
right	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
how many people in your band	3624	B
seventy	3624	B
holy mackerel that's	3624	B
uh-huh	3624	B
boy that is a huge organization that's great	3624	B
because_1 about the best i can normally hope for is about fifty in in the band i have here	3624	B
but that fills a stage and keeps us busy but they run half- half of them professionals from uh a lot of them_1 are from uh faculty at Penn State here	3624	B
and so they wanna play things that uh push them to do so that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together we have about four concerts per year indoors	3624	B
and two or three that we play outside and the last one we did was in a large uh mall close here to Penn- uh we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall	3624	B
so that worked out very nicely	3624	B
yeah	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
wow that	3624	B
are you just saying that you sight read every concert	3624	B
okay um-hum	3624	B
okay_1 and where does where does this happen Laurie is this in Dallas	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
well i declare that's amazing	3624	B
okay	3624	B
okay	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
do any of your you in your group get paid for any of this	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
uh-huh and well you do have to buy your music who who sponsors you basically the city	3624	B
yeah um my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation	3624	B
yeah	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
yes	3624	B
um-hum	3624	B
well i i work the same way well i'll be darned it's amazing-	3624	B
okay universal health insurance right	3658	B
um	3658	B
well i think universal health insurance like national health like what Canada has is that what you're you're thinking this subject is about	3658	B
did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject	3658	B
yeah uh the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota	3658	B
is uh going to begin testing a program	3658	B
a state funded program for citizens of those two states	3658	B
and there's fourteen other	3658	B
uh states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning	3658	B
i think it's a trend this this that's uh probably may go nationwide eventually because_1 i think national health is something that we all need it's getting to a point that	3658	B
you have to have it you have to have some form of health insurance	3658	B
and extremely expensive though	3658	B
um-hum	3658	B
well that's the thing you know uh unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are are paying for the people that don't have health insurance	3658	B
yeah	3658	B
i don't think you um	3658	B
yes i do	3658	B
uh through my company yes	3658	B
but i have been in a situation uh recently where	3658	B
i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year	3658	B
and my wife developed cancer and we didn't have any insurance	3658	B
and it was uh	3658	B
go to Parkland type situation	3658	B
uh because it was a life threatening situation it was very good	3658	B
uh as it- as it turned out one of the top um people or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland	3658	B
no it's not free but uh	3658	B
it's it's a situation that because i didn't have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county	3658	B
i had a bad experience as it turned out	3658	B
um i was fortunate that there was Parkland	3658	B
uh no she passed away oh that's all right that happens	3658	B
yeah	3658	B
but in any event um i'm in favor of national health	3658	B
if i had to vote for it	3658	B
oh is that right	3658	B
um-hum um-hum	3658	B
well i when i grew up and i grew up in south central Kansas um we had and my mom worked for the health department the county health department	3658	B
and we had X rays every year we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least	3658	B
um we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff and uh when my children were growing up	3658	B
we didn't have that we had to pay for it which i wasn't opposed to paying for it i had the money to pay for it but i'm sure that there were people that don't	3658	B
um-hum	3658	B
did not know that	3658	B
um-hum	3658	B
okay	3658	A
um that's right	3658	A
what would we like to say i think	3658	A
um-hum	3658	A
i think that's what the subject is about	3658	A
in the Dallas the Morning Times i guess i did not	3658	A
well it's been interesting that we	3658	A
yes	3658	A
so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them_1 on polls will um say that they think that everyone has a right to health care	3658	A
and yet i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it and	3658	A
which is why people are talking about we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair	3658	A
you have health insurance through your company	3658	A
oh my goodness	3658	A
that must've been horrible-	3658	A
how was your care at Parkland	3658	A
but Camp Parkland is not free either	3658	A
is it affordable	3658	A
so you did have a good experience	3658	A
is your wife better i hope	3658	A
i'm real sorry	3658	A
sure it does happen but it's very sad	3658	A
well so am i actually um i'm a pediatrician and i feel very strongly about um children and um developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year	3658	A
where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most	3658	A
so um i'm really quite active in trying to uh uh be proactive at least to for children's issues it's very complex very complicated but	3658	A
um i just strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits	3658	A
um	3658	A
-well and the costs of so much has gone up so much the cost of immunizations for example	3658	A
um and just the legal	3658	A
the legal benefits um that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera	3658	A
so well i don't know it's it is interesting in case you didn't know Texas leads the nation in uninsured children thirty one percent of all Texas children	3658	A
do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid	3658	A
so uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care	3658	A
and i work in the children's Parkland system and it's pretty overwhelming to me	3658	A
but um it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county	3658	A
name's Brian	3604	A
oh nice to meet you Rita	3604	A
exactly some of the boring ones you just kind of babble on i guess	3604	A
all right we ready to give it a shot all right	3604	A
okay	3604	A
uh-huh	3604	A
yeah i agree with that i think especially in some of the the jobs that the government has you just need people who are you know	3604	A
who are sober all the time to take care of them_1 you know you're paying them_1 to do a certain job and if they're	3604	A
they're on drugs and doing things they're not supposed to be doing	3604	A
uh-huh	3604	A
absolutely	3604	A
yeah well you know what i think part of the thing that you do when you apply for a job is you you know you tell them_1 that you're gonna do a certain type of work and be a certain type of person and	3604	A
you know i think part of that is living the law	3604	A
i know if i had my own company i'd want people who are honest in all they're dealings so	3604	A
uh-huh	3604	A
um-hum	3604	A
oh absolutely i was i went to school in Plano when i was growing up	3604	A
and just i don't know it was i was surprised how much of it was there	3604	A
yep	3604	A
yeah	3604	A
yeah and i think the second part to that is you know they're also violating civil rights when they're using these drugs- illegal drugs	3604	A
yeah and i think you know	3604	A
personally i the way i feel about it is it's a lot better that we go ahead and and help these people you know that when we find that they're they're using drugs that we help them to get over that so they can be	3604	A
good people- or not not necessarily i'm not saying they're bad people but they they can be productive people	3604	A
right	3604	A
uh-huh	3604	A
absolutely you know i think i look at especially some of the professional athletes and i was a big Mavericks fan for a long time and i watched Roy Tarpley you know	3604	A
he could have lost his life if it wasn't for someone who cared enough to say let's give you a drug test and find out where you're at	3604	A
absolutely- i think it's important that we remember that it's not the job that's important thing it's it's the individual	3604	A
kind of like what you were saying that it's just i don't know to me that's it's putting the focus back where it should be you know sure	3604	A
some people might not appreciate it but when it comes right down to it you're more worried about the individual and where their status is	3604	A
yeah	3604	A
uh-huh	3604	A
yeah	3604	A
oh absolutely	3604	A
and i think that's the key	3604	A
yeah	3604	A
yep	3604	A
well that's good- i- i- i like that idea very much	3604	A
hi i'm Rita from Garland	3604	B
uh we have quite a in depth subject here don't we	3604	B
why couldn't we get something simple like movies or books something more uh more fun	3604	B
yeah well we will we'll just give lots to talk about won't we	3604	B
yeah that's right	3604	B
okay well uh i have a business of my own	3604	B
and i feel pretty strongly about it i don't mind being drug tested and i don't feel the employees should	3604	B
now you know	3604	B
no i- i- i you know i think sometimes that when you fly for example you know pilots and things like that or people um	3604	B
that are even using uh automated equipment of some kind where another person could be injured you know	3604	B
you know and uh well a lot of times i think it depends upon	3604	B
the occasion but you know i've never had any problem with being drug tested and i wouldn't think that other people should have either i guess that's sort of a personal opinion	3604	B
um-hum	3604	B
well i have a private high school and uh we uh get permission from the parents before the children the students enroll	3604	B
to allow random drug testing because i've seen what can happen	3604	B
to youngsters who were not on drugs being around it and getting influenced by their peers who are	3604	B
and there's a lot of it in the public school system	3604	B
and	3604	B
yeah and of course good kids try to stay away from it but i've seen kids	3604	B
start out not being on drugs and end up being there because it was being sold right out under- under their noses you know	3604	B
so uh you know i feel pretty strongly about it i you know i know that	3604	B
there are people that say we're violating the civil rights and what have you but they don't have to enroll	3604	B
you know they don't have to take that job if that's the way they feel about it	3604	B
yeah that's right they're violating ours you know	3604	B
well they can be more productive and more useful yeah i feel that way too we don't uh kick them out we ask that we call parents in if we haven't had one test positive yet but	3604	B
if it did we would call the parents in and uh you know get help for them before it's too late	3604	B
oh he just	3604	B
um-hum and uh you know it's just really a shame that he he couldn't get enough help to keep his career going	3604	B
yeah i think so and uh i think that youngsters who looked up to the Roy Tarpleys and	3604	B
uh the other people that have gotten into drugs i think they're going to be more conscious of the effect it can have and they get you know look at what he's thrown away	3604	B
you know a wonderful career a tremendous amount of money uh because he couldn't get enough help to over come it	3604	B
and probably wasn't started early enough either	3604	B
no but i think they can influence the youngsters in a good positive way when they're good role models	3604	B
now i think so too and like it's important you know i don't- i have never been against being drug tested myself and so i feel that the owner of a company you know you set forth the policy and you follow through with it too	3604	B
you know and it doesn't exclude this one or that one it's everybody's it's all- it's all inclusive	3604	B
i know TI does that TI uh you know they never know who who's gonna be called	3604	B
you know	3604	B
um-hum it's just a random thing that they'll get a call in the morning-	3604	B
Brian in Plano Texas how are you doing today	3647	A
great Nancy	3647	A
you're in Plano also uh	3647	A
well good to hear i was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania	3647	A
really	3647	A
all right well good to hear good to hear	3647	A
which one	3647	A
oh yeah the Utah Jazz	3647	A
yeah they're they're pretty good they got some	3647	A
good good some good uh good players out there	3647	A
well you ready for New Year's Eve	3647	A
good should we uh start this so we can what was your name again Nancy that's right and i'm Brian just a moment	3647	A
okay Nancy the i guess the today's subject is benefits in a job other than salary what uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as as crucial benefits	3647	A
uh-huh	3647	A
oh	3647	A
uh-huh	3647	A
right uh-huh	3647	A
to to compensate for some of the benefits oh	3647	A
yes	3647	A
well -that's that's an excellent so actually that is a benefit uh	3647	A
yeah	3647	A
right right	3647	A
well i guess that's a good point uh i do belong to a a large corporation or my that where i'm currently employed	3647	A
and there's uh there's some different things uh one that you've already mentioned is is health insurance i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a group plan	3647	A
as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation	3647	A
and that got to be somewhat expensive and so i- i think one of the benefits i- i see is the uh is the group uh group discount	3647	A
yeah	3647	A
-and yes and that's that's one thing i do have	3647	A
if i didn't have a family i don't think i would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life i don't think i would have insurance uh other	3647	A
i don't think i would go through that expense one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called a flex schedule	3647	A
where i could go and i could work uh nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours or i could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a four- you know three week- day weekend	3647	A
and make uh make my job flexible in that case	3647	A
well basically yeah i had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year i mean	3647	A
uh because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that uh i needed to make my schedule uh	3647	A
so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel so	3647	A
so i- i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed and i don't currently- have that in my current operation but uh	3647	A
you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and that's that's good	3647	A
and uh what other benefits do you think are important	3647	A
yeah yeah that's true	3647	A
well and that's an individual thing	3647	A
yeah with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan	3647	A
where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can	3647	A
uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times	3647	A
and uh also uh in one of my wife's uh companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that effectively- they made a certain-	3647	A
hi fine i'm Nancy how are you	3647	B
i'm in Plano also yes we're not too long distance today	3647	B
oh that was good Utah i've had a couple of but that was it	3647	B
yeah	3647	B
learned about their basketball team	3647	B
uh Jazz	3647	B
yeah yeah	3647	B
that's what i heard yeah	3647	B
yeah	3647	B
i am	3647	B
okay	3647	B
Nancy	3647	B
right right	3647	B
right	3647	B
uh-huh	3647	B
well i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job	3647	B
i'm a nurse and i work i float	3647	B
so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that	3647	B
so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i- i make enough money by the hour to make up for that	3647	B
right uh-huh yeah it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace	3647	B
and then i have my freedom i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do	3647	B
well it is to me most people prefer the security of nine to five and weekends off and	3647	B
knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement and i'm just	3647	B
uh-huh	3647	B
right	3647	B
yeah	3647	B
right and especially if you have a family then i think it makes a big difference	3647	B
yeah	3647	B
right	3647	B
oh yeah	3647	B
right	3647	B
could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week	3647	B
uh-huh	3647	B
um-hum	3647	B
yeah	3647	B
yeah	3647	B
oh well i guess retirement that kind of thing which i don't worry much about so	3647	B
i just prefer to worry about today and probably not a practical attitude but that's who i am so	3647	B
um-hum	3647	B
right	3647	B
well just go ahead and talk that's all	3666	B
yeah	3666	B
i don't think so huh-uh	3666	B
yes i'm i'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden	3666	B
uh-huh	3666	B
good uh-huh you're ahead of me	3666	B
that's better	3666	B
oh that's really good	3666	B
yes	3666	B
i don't do any of that	3666	B
really well i call my lawn man Eric whatever his name is i can't remember who's gonna come and build me a fence too	3666	B
well he's gonna give me an estimate and for ten dollars a week i don't see any reason for me to be doing it	3666	B
no for my yard	3666	B
yeah he is	3666	B
yeah but ten dollars	3666	B
or what is- what does he charge not even that what does he charge me it's like next to nothing it's ten because i it's forty a month but if there's five weeks i still pay forty	3666	B
well he won't pull weeds he says he'll spray them_1 but he won't pull them	3666	B
uh he won't cut them is what he won't do because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the	3666	B
the trimmer over the rocks and he's right that's true but he just says to keep spraying them so	3666	B
anyway Gene sprayed them once or twice for me so	3666	B
that was free	3666	B
no no there are two out front i thought i'd grab one of these days but i haven't bothered as i walk on by	3666	B
i start to pull the weeds in the rocks out front and	3666	B
all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds and there was dog dirt in it	3666	B
and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there and i left the whole thing and that was about a month ago	3666	B
i would rather a snake	3666	B
no	3666	B
i just left the whole thing the bag is still out there because i haven't touched i haven't gone back over there it really made me mad	3666	B
so anyway but	3666	B
oh yeah now they died	3666	B
i don't know	3666	B
i don't know and then i got some nice uh mums at Thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather	3666	B
they looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas then they started to die too	3666	B
so i don't think any of it comes back but i don't know maybe sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to	3666	B
so	3666	B
yeah	3666	B
really	3666	B
well that's good they're the best kind they they're like indestructible	3666	B
they really grow nice and sometimes they're not supposed to come back but lots of times they do	3666	B
so	3666	B
we'll see	3666	B
they're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they but that's because we didn't hit one for a long time	3666	B
i hope not neither one of us is getting paid for this	3666	B
yeah really i know it i can't believe this i got somebody from Utah	3666	B
and somebody where was the person last night was from far away	3666	B
and we get each other down the street this is so funny	3666	B
yeah i've had Dallas Arlington i've had uh one Plano	3666	B
and then a lady from Brigham Utah whose son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace	3666	B
and then um	3666	B
another state i can't remember but she told me about the Utah Jazz we talked about basketball	3666	B
and i don't remember what what the place was last night like i'm thinking Colorado but i'm not sure another place anyway	3666	B
so the but mostly they're from the area this	3666	B
not for me you know not not for me because all i have is rocks and weeds	3666	B
i know	3666	B
i know we're not typical Texans	3666	B
but	3666	B
-well i don't know i hope so	3666	B
come on come on	3666	B
i don't know	3666	B
i know well we can talk about something else it's just a suggested topic	3666	B
so how's the baby do you think how's the let's talk about the baby	3666	B

let's talk about the baby	3666	A
okay um do you have any pets now	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
oh okay um	3688	A
that a matter of choice or compulsion	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
well right now i'm student and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that	3688	A
no we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat	3688	A
yeah they're very strict about it	3688	A
oh love animals	3688	A
i was raised our house when i when i was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house it's almost- almost always at least one cat sometimes you know like fifteen or twenty	3688	A
but uh always cats in the house	3688	A
always	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
how old are your kids	3688	A
um okay_1	3688	A
one our first he's about ten- eleven weeks now	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
yeah uh originally West Virginia	3688	A
um i don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country but-	3688	A
Charleston West Virginia	3688	A
okay that's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway	3688	A
okay in the north end of the state you got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania	3688	A
right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown	3688	A
yeah yeah it's well uh my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far	3688	A
so	3688	A
oh it's beautiful	3688	A
uh well from my neck of the woods it's hilly um you know	3688	A
uh maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation	3688	A
uh -that type	3688	A
variations from the valleys up to the hills to hilltops	3688	A
um	3688	A
not a lot of farmland there mostly it's uh i mean you know there's you know individuals with their own own farm- uh growing their own food	3688	A
uh most of the agriculture it's more in the way of uh sheep and cattle	3688	A
and even that's you know small time mostly uh the biggest chunk of what's going on there is is uh industries coal mines and chemical plants and power plants	3688	A
uh aluminum plants there's like two aluminum plants with you know	3688	A
computer engineering	3688	A
uh just finished up my fourth semester	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
it- it's a big change	3688	A
i spent twenty years as a mechanic so yeah	3688	A
yeah	3688	A
i'm working on a bachelor's degree	3688	A
i'm working on a bachelor's degree it'll be computer-	3688	A
pardon	3688	A
uh it seems to me from what i've been able to find out that's considered a pretty good program it's nice and small which means you know	3688	A
if you don't get the class this semester then you got to wait three or four semester- you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again but uh it's- it's worth it once you get it	3688	A
oh yeah yeah most the class is pretty small	3688	A
that works out real well	3688	A
uh well um	3688	A
first off we'd probably wind up with a uh cat or maybe a puppy uh i'm partial towards the larger dogs um	3688	A
our last we we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus uh had a hamster or two they were- they got to be a lot of fun	3688	A
uh it's amazing how much character you can	3688	A
well we don't right now no we've uh i grew up with uh with pets my folks and i always had a dog and a cat some birds but uh right now we don't have anything	3688	B
what about you	3688	B
well we've just um	3688	B
it seems like we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something and uh it was never convenient to have anything i we're thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house	3688	B
uh someplace where there are you know we can take care of it and everything we've got some children who would just really uh enjoy having an animal you know a dog i think and	3688	B
what about you all	3688	B
um-hum	3688	B
oh no	3688	B
is that right	3688	B
but you like uh you like pets and things	3688	B
oh yeah	3688	B
um-hum	3688	B
oh yeah we enjoyed- we enjoyed them_1 uh we like we like pets but um you know you've got to deal with uh taking care of them_1 and and feeding them_1 and everything like that	3688	B
and our kids are we've got some children and they're not	3688	B
not used to it you know on a daily basis they they uh and	3688	B
oh from fourteen down to seven	3688	B
you've sound like you've got some small ones in the background	3688	B
is that right	3688	B
oh great congratulations	3688	B

pretty nice country up there	3688	B
hills or what	3688	B
um-hum	3688	B

hum	3688	B
well yes that's good and probably a good uh student teacher ratio and things yeah	3688	B
good	3688	B
well i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere what would you get	3688	B
um-hum	3688	B
um-hum	3688	B
um-hum	3688	B
a hamster um oh yeah	3688	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3602	B
um well we we are the same we usually wait until they come out on video and then just rent them_1 and watch them_1 at home and even then we	3602	B
don't watch a whole lot of the real current movies um we did go to see last weekend Star Trek Six	3602	B
yes my husband he's a well we're both kind of Star Trek fans i wouldn't go as far to say that we're {trekkies} but we we both enjoy Star Trek so we went to see that and um	3602	B
we did we enjoyed it it was a good movie i guess it's their last one and they the cast they're getting pretty old i don't know if you're a Star Trek fan at all are you	3602	B
oh did he like it	3602	B
we yes we did it was it was a good story and and they sign you know at the end they signed their name so i guess that	3602	B
that means that really is the end so and um we just went or we rented City Slickers	3602	B
a couple weeks ago have you seen that one did you like it oh at the movie house or	3602	B
oh	3602	B
um-hum um-hum	3602	B
well how fun	3602	B
oh yeah that was that was kind of a fun one we'd heard a lot about that and had waited until it came you know out on video and then rented it and enjoyed it um have you seen Doc Hollywood	3602	B
did you enjoy that one	3602	B
yeah we haven't seen that either we're waiting a couple more weeks and then we'll watch it is that fairly funny or	3602	B
uh-huh	3602	B
oh oh good how about_1 Beauty and the Beast have you	3602	B
we haven't seen we promised our kids we'd take them_1 over Christmas vacation so probably in the next couple of weeks we'll see that one but	3602	B
um	3602	B
oh did you oh that's fun i liked the do you have kids or did you go just for yourself just- for yourself	3602	B
well how fun	3602	B
oh now i wonder that's not not out on video is it	3602	B
i wonder if that'll be the next one they release maybe if that's	3602	B
oh yeah	3602	B
oh now- now did you like do you like the little theater where you go and and watch the movies	3602	B
oh	3602	B
oh	3602	B
oh	3602	B
hm	3602	B
oh	3602	B
well that's fun yeah we we our little community doesn't have a movie theater but we the nearest town has a um	3602	B
they have- it's a four you know four theaters in one that has the different shows going on	3602	B
and i know they've gotten Addams Family have you seen that one have you Addams Family- do you think- are you going are you interested at all in that	3602	B
right right	3602	B
um-hum	3602	B
wow my word and what- how much is it for a movie there where you're at	3602	B
is it we were when we went it was four fifty four fifty a person and that seems like a real lot to me even	3602	B
boy	3602	B
boy i'll say not that's a that's a chunk we usually get go ahead and get the discount tickets but i don't think they were accepting them_1 on on Star Trek or you know some of the newer ones i guess they don't	3602	B
to try and make their money and so so do you watch do you enjoy movies or	3602	B
do you oh that's fun so you've seen you have a wide variety under your belt then right	3602	B
uh-huh	3602	B
right- right	3602	B
oh do they come that soon	3602	B
oh wow yeah	3602	B
oh wow	3602	B
boy i'll say i can't imagine why everybody doesn't wait till they come there because_1 like you- well like you say around here we have to wait	3602	B
oh a couple- um probably six months to a year before they go to the dollar dollar theaters	3602	B
okay_1 well i don't see many of the current movies i usually wait till they come in the second run theaters	3602	A
but um what what ones have you seen lately	3602	A
um-hum	3602	A
yep	3602	A
oh you did	3602	A
um-hum	3602	A
did you like it	3602	A
i'm not but my husband is and he went last weekend to see it too	3602	A
yeah he did	3602	A
huh	3602	A
okay i saw that recently	3602	A
yeah in fact i saw it twice	3602	A
well actually once it was on an airplane and then the second time it was at a um	3602	A
it's interesting it's an old uh theater not a movie theater but like a play theater	3602	A
that and they've put in tables and chairs then they show movies in there	3602	A
so it's kind of neat yeah	3602	A
um-hum	3602	A
um-hum	3602	A
yes	3602	A
yes	3602	A
um yeah it's it's one of these lighthearted things it's it's not very serious but it's it it was cute i really i enjoyed it so	3602	A
no huh-uh	3602	A
oh no	3602	A
i haven't seen that i saw Hundred and One Dalmatians	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
no i went with my next door neighbor our husbands both said no way	3602	A
it used to be my favorite movie when i was little so i went back and	3602	A
i don't think so	3602	A
i don't know but you know we went for a dollar it was fun	3602	A
i really enjoyed it i didn't get bored or anything either	3602	A
yeah we have a real nice one it's brand new	3602	A
and um i- i suspect it'll be a full priced theater when this highway goes in but right now it's almost in the middle of nowhere	3602	A
so it's not very crowded and it's real inexpensive and it's brand new so it's it's a really nice place to go	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
um-hum	3602	A
um-hum	3602	A
no huh-uh	3602	A
because_1 he said when he went to see Star Trek he was out in California with a friend he said it was like seven fifty a person	3602	A
i think it's about_1 six dollars yeah	3602	A
wow	3602	A
yeah well i think you can get that maybe on a matinee here but	3602	A
you know about six dollars is what they're running and that's why i don't normally go to them	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
that's right	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
yeah we usually go usually every weekend we go to one yeah yeah	3602	A
yeah well we never used to do that until this other theater went in and it's you know it's inexpensive and it's entertainment for night	3602	A
and um the only thing is that when people at work talk about the current movies i don't know what's going on but	3602	A
you know about_1 four weeks later i will	3602	A
yeah they have been lately it used to be you'd have to wait months and months and now like i was just looking at the listings now this week they started showing All I Want for Christmas	3602	A
and that's a very recent release	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
well i don't know	3602	A
yes	3602	A
yeah	3602	A
it used to be like that but now	3602	A
okay well considering you moved here from California i guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you would have down there	3663	B
especially the last few years	3663	B
it's kind of has it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it uh	3663	B
that's what i was thinking	3663	B
yet generally if we're gonna get them it's not going to happen uh prior to January one you know you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December but	3663	B
usually the bitterest weather if we're gonna have any comes in January and February then by March things are getting warm again so we really don't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north	3663	B
it's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before lots of times	3663	B
no it's nice i just came in from outside and it's it's really pretty it's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out	3663	B
-before it rains again i'm a i'm a scoutmaster and so i wind up going out camping with	3663	B
uh a bunch of- boys at one time and so its better for us if it hasn't been just totally wet before we go	3663	B
oh yeah	3663	B
yeah we camp year round	3663	B
but uh it's uh it's definitely different and then i guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right	3663	B
well it is	3663	B
it's not as humid as Houston say or Atlanta but it	3663	B
its more humid than Arizona and California for the most part	3663	B
were you northern California	3663	B
central okay so that was	3663	B
dry but pretty even climate wasn't it year round fairly not wide fluctuations	3663	B
but it's a drier	3663	B
hundred when you have a hundred here everybody's dying	3663	B
oh	3663	B
what types of what take what type of business takes you to those climates or was that just vacation or something	3663	B
oh	3663	B
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages	3663	B
oh	3663	B
that's interesting you don't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you're thinking of things that people might be doing	3663	B
oh so you're you're with the home office now	3663	B
well the uh	3663	B
i think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh the weather	3663	B
you know does change fast and things do happen severely a few times a year but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between	3663	B
yeah and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that	3663	B
particularly if i'm gonna be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things and that's nicer yeah i do quite a bit of that	3663	B
think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas and it is a little more humid out there than it is here so	3663	B
i guess we'll	3663	B
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the	3663	B
really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains there's not much between us and the North Pole and then when you get one of those tornado type	3663	B
systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms and it	3663	B
it doesn't seem to be	3663	B
yeah	3663	A
oh	3663	A
yeah we have um in California i'm in central- i lived in central California we have rain couple times a year and other than that you know it'd be maybe October and then in the spring and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain	3663	A
so	3663	A
yeah yeah	3663	A
yeah there has	3663	A
so here i know that um last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state and i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year	3663	A
yeah yet still could come huh	3663	A
uh-huh	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
hm	3663	A
yeah yeah it's so hard to predict here	3663	A
yeah well today it's not bad out there	3663	A
um-hum	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
uh-huh	3663	A
yeah so you do that even in January huh uh-huh	3663	A
yeah oh that's interesting	3663	A
um-hum	3663	A
yeah yep and they're not too pleasant it gets so humid to me it's humid here people that i know that come from um like Georgia or North Carolina yeah they say this isn't humid	3663	A
yeah but i find it humid	3663	A
right	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
i was central California Central Valley so -it's very dry there	3663	A
yeah yeah	3663	A
well it's pretty hot in the summer it's in the usually you know for good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees but it's a dry heat yeah	3663	A
uh-huh yeah i know huh well i lived in Africa for a couple years in	3663	A
Cameroon and that's a tropical climate and it really feels similar to this during the summer	3663	A
no i was um working with um i still work with Wycliffe Bible Translators	3663	A
it's an organization where we are looking to translate the Bible into languages of the world that aren't yet written	3663	A
right languages that don't have anything written yet so this is like the first thing that's written down or you know first an alphabet is developed and then um	3663	A
so	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
yeah well it's based here um the international headquarters for Wycliffe Bible Translators is right here in in Dallas	3663	A
yeah right now i am so that's what brought me here	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
yeah i agree i agree i	3663	A
i thought the fall was really nice	3663	A
uh-huh	3663	A
yeah uh-huh	3663	A
um-hum	3663	A
yeah and you probably do a lot of that with scouts scouting uh-huh	3663	A
um-hum	3663	A
um-hum	3663	A
yeah	3663	A
um-hum	3663	A
okay all set then	3660	B
uh what do you think about it	3660	B
um-hum	3660	B
oh i didn't realize that	3660	B
um-hum	3660	B
okay	3660	B
um-hum yeah that's right i have heard uh i don't remember what they call it sort of like a	3660	B
positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh	3660	B
a positive indication of drugs but there's not really there weren't really any there uh every now and then there's an error and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated	3660	B
everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure and	3660	B
they talk about it as a you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions uh	3660	B
if they uh they test for drugs i i'm i can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore i know we did in the military but i don't know if once your in they continue to do it but i guess you're always on call for it	3660	B
uh-huh	3660	B
um-hum	3660	B
uh-huh	3660	B
in my	3660	B
uh-huh right	3660	B
so your big beef with it is the uh	3660	B
is is it's a good idea but	3660	B
like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better or make sure it's a lot safer because_1 a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever yeah i i i tend to agree with you David	3660	B
yeah my brother uh my brother used to work for Wal-Mart and then i don't know if he still does or what because_1 i don't know if Sam's is actually part of it but he you know is working at Sam's now	3660	B
okay yeah then he's been working for the company for a while too yeah he enjoys it good company um you all uh have some his	3660	B
telling me about good profit sharing and all that so	3660	B
it's good news	3660	B
uh-huh	3660	B
um-hum	3660	B
yeah that's what my brother was telling me that's good good news- good deal well uh how long were we supposed- i haven't done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for	3660	B
okay we got a couple more minutes then i guess uh think what else i can say about that um	3660	B
right um everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test	3660	B
uh no well let me think about that yeah it was after i was- i had already been hired um yeah you get hired then you come in the first i	3660	B
seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation and i thought i	3660	B
boy i can't remember that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test maybe it was during the interview i came up a couple times for an interview so it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened	3660	B
but uh i guess just like other companies other friends i've been hearing about that have been moving around it's it's before they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment so i'm sure that happened to me too	3660	B
what what about oh they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart so	3660	B
right	3660	B
right yeah i wasn't	3660	B
uh i think it's a real good concept uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined	3660	A
from what i've seen on the news there's a a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing	3660	A
yeah um there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test but they didn't know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down	3660	A
and uh turns out it was a prescription	3660	A
or people getting somebody else's blood test	3660	A
same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh like AIDS tests and such	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
oh yeah	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
um-hum	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
yeah i not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh	3660	A
a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program it's it's not a random through the system- as each employee comes in	3660	A
part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test um	3660	A
but and uh i think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs	3660	A
and then they have thousands and thousands of the samples that uh going through it in a day and	3660	A
bottles get mixed up and things like that a potential for inaccuracy	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
yeah yeah Sam's is part of Wal-Mart	3660	A
yeah	3660	A
oh yeah	3660	A
the company i thought was a great place to work	3660	A
um-hum	3660	A
yeah they got to have had two or three years in with them then you start buying stock and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio uh not portfolio just you know against Wal-Mart stock	3660	A
but uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while	3660	A
uh you're supposed to get five minutes	3660	A
um	3660	A
do you have any idea uh	3660	A
let's see were- you were you were tested for drugs as you got into uh as as you got into TI	3660	A
yeah uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or	3660	A
oh okay	3660	A
yeah yeah	3660	A
yeah they they it was after i was already working there and they weren't testing any of those that were already working so	3660	A
hi	3642	A
well	3642	A
providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task and i uh personally i don't approve of it for two reasons number one	3642	A
is that i think that uh the federal government	3642	A
has a problem with the deficit right now and if they were to administer this they would uh get us more and more into debt	3642	A
further than we can ever get out ourselves number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would	3642	A
would be dried up and really no one would be would only answer to to the government to a big bureaucratic- bureaucratic mess	3642	A
and uh i've seen what it has done in other countries and so i don't think uh	3642	A
i don't think we should head in that direction although that we have problems right now and i do agree that they exist because health care insurance for for everyone	3642	A
is skyrocketing and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore	3642	A
how do you feel about the whole- whole ordeal	3642	A
um-hum	3642	A
uh-huh	3642	A
okay	3642	A
oh yes	3642	A
but what what you're think	3642	A
yeah so what you're saying though is instead of having the national government- government administer	3642	A
giving health insurance to every man woman and child with throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs	3642	A
uh that people are forced to pay for it right now	3642	A
is that is that correct or do you think that	3642	A
well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes and the	3642	A
the income- the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more cash- taxes to to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the the public themselves	3642	A
get health insurance and they provide their own health insurance	3642	A
you think it might be- get better huh i i kind of disagree the reason being is uh	3642	A
we have i don't know i guess it's my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic	3642	A
rules that it would take to administer it and um	3642	A
the the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and and uh don't allow	3642	A
cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business people would still have to pay taxes the money would have to come from somewhere	3642	A
and so you'd see- i i feel that the cost would increase	3642	A
dramatically also but in the same sense the the care and the the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical uh field	3642	A
would would diminish	3642	A
um i	3642	A
so what- well what do you think	3642	B
um-hum	3642	B
well i agree that it's a big task but i think that i think that the US should move towards some kind of national health care plan	3642	B
at least as a long term kind of goal	3642	B
you know possibly	3642	B
you know just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing but i think that ultimately it would be	3642	B
a good idea to	3642	B
um and not have a completely socialized	3642	B
medical system in the country but maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now	3642	B
it um just because it seems that	3642	B
um health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit	3642	B
perhaps and so that's	3642	B
and that's a that's a vicious cycle of course	3642	B
because	3642	B
um	3642	B
well	3642	B
i um	3642	B
well i wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately i don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea	3642	B
and	3642	B
um	3642	B
right	3642	B
the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance	3642	B
and so that the other people have no health insurance and you know they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies	3642	B
and somebody winds up paying for that and	3642	B
basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance	3642	B
so i do not see that anything	3642	B
this situation would get any worse that way it might get better	3642	B
um-hum	3642	B
um-hum	3642	B
um-hum	3642	B
yeah well i think-	3642	B
okay_1	3605	B
well	3605	B
uh seeing as how i'm sixty four i- i- i've seen them_1 all	3605	B
yeah from the time that i was in in college in the forties	3605	B
when the majors that were open to women were well we could major in business but that meant that it we would either teach school be secretaries or bookkeepers not accountants just bookkeepers	3605	B
our um	3605	B
let's see well we could have gone well i went to Abilene Christian College now University and we didn't have nurses training	3605	B
so being a school teacher a secretary bookkeeper or nurse	3605	B
were about the only occupations open to women and uh i- i've seen the generation change uh	3605	B
i belong to the Altrusa Club of Dallas and uh we extended and uh	3605	B
uh started a club called the Altrusa Club of Downtown Dallas	3605	B
and the average age is oh i don't know thirty five i guess early thirties maybe	3605	B
uh and i've seen	3605	B
uh uh the the women's occupations change to everything engineering doctors accountants CPA's	3605	B
uh anything you wanna name	3605	B
so i- i think that trend will continue into the future uh and i- i think that	3605	B
unfortunately one of the fall outs is that these young women that were	3605	B
that- that of- of my day that the young women school teachers were so bright and so capable that they're now the lawyers and accountants and the doctors	3605	B
and i don't think anybody has focused on on that and has seen that as one of the causes of the deterioration in our school system	3605	B
oh i agree with you	3605	B
um-hum	3605	B
yeah but uh i went on to law school	3605	B
and when i got out of law school out of the seventy graduates there were three women	3605	B
and now out at SMU it's somewhere between forty and fifty percent uh of the students are women	3605	B
and i- i'm sure that trend will continue	3605	B
and- and uh there were no women preachers of course	3605	B
oh this has been oh ten years ago i guess	3605	B
i was at a luncheon and uh uh it just happened that i sat next to a Methodist preacher	3605	B
and i said we Catholics are running out of priests	3605	B
uh how are you all making out he said well if it were not for the fact that roughly thirty percent of the entering class at Perkins uh	3605	B
School out at SMU we'd be running out	3605	B
yeah yeah uh-huh what- what do you see is the the future of women's roles	3605	B
um-hum	3605	B
um-hum	3605	B
um-hum	3605	B
um-hum	3605	B
yeah	3605	B
yeah um-hum	3605	B
yeah uh most companies even though they have written down policies that say uh	3605	B
we will have uh day care policies and that sort of thing uh	3605	B
and parental leave and that-	3605	B
okay we're supposed to take talk about the changes in woman's roles i guess	3605	A
you wanna start	3605	A
oh really	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
uh-huh	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
hum	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
hum	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
yeah	3605	A
yeah that's true	3605	A
yeah well they don't give them a whole lot of incentive i mean you look at the pay a teacher gets	3605	A
versus some of these other professions and and and society's saying you're not that valuable	3605	A
you- you know and that that sends a strong signal	3605	A
so	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
wow	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
um-hum yeah	3605	A
yeah	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
course not	3605	A
uh-huh	3605	A
well some churches have	3605	A
that's for sure	3605	A
oh i'd	3605	A
i guess about_1 about the same as men i don't see a whole lot of barriers except that the women are still stuck with the problem of what- of how to handle children	3605	A
and i mean it's companies at least the companies i work with aren't helping and they're not recognizing that that's a real problem	3605	A
um basic- just basic things like having a day care center on the premises	3605	A
they don't understand what it costs the company to have someone have to you know go to the day care center every time the kid is sick or hurt or whatever	3605	A
or you know just there's a lot of lost time there and i think that they'd find people a lot more productive and a lot more willing to maybe work long hours or do whatever it takes if they would help taking care of the children	3605	A
because they're not doing that at all	3605	A
so you've got you know an extra problem that it doesn't seem like the men have to deal with very much some do	3605	A
and some don't that's the biggest problem	3605	A
um-hum	3605	A
