um-hum	3763	B
uh baseball	3763	B
well i've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers	3763	B
uh	3763	B
more so with uh	3763	B
uh their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that that closely	3763	B
but uh since- you know since i live here so close to Arlington uh	3763	B
that's the team that i've been kind of following	3763	B
um-hum	3763	B
right	3763	B
well i think that uh	3763	B
you know with uh	3763	B
so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um	3763	B
you know i think	3763	B
i'm not real sure about that- do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's uh	3763	B
yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit	3763	B
yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five million- that's a lot of money	3763	B
yeah they are	3763	B
um-hum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to	3763	B
i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh	3763	B
uh pay him what his salary's going to be	3763	B
uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent	3763	B
and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway	3763	B
but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the six- you know the six million dollars a year this year	3763	B
uh-huh	3763	B
oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him	3763	B
yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh	3763	B
Pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the Rangers are concerned i think	3763	B
i think they need some definitely need some pitching	3763	B
uh	3763	B
and so i you know i	3763	B
um the pitching coach	3763	B
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was going- was helping out uh	3763	B
his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh	3763	B
oh you don't like Howse huh	3763	B
oh Tom Grieve	3763	B
yeah i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet	3763	B
but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they	3763	B
that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and	3763	B
um	3763	B
you do huh	3763	B
that's contrary to uh popular belief you know	3763	B
oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know	3763	B
they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and	3763	B
and uh	3763	B
yeah	3763	B
are you there okay now tell me your favorite team	3763	A
yes	3763	A
okay i think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed	3763	A
so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers	3763	A
what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do	3763	A
well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his	3763	A
yes and the Rangers go up a little bit um-hum	3763	A
i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest	3763	A
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous	3763	A
no	3763	A
that's right	3763	A
what i saw on the news today that Buechele- Buechele was back just to visit	3763	A
i'm awful sorry he's not still	3763	A
oh i'm sure it was	3763	A
Pittsburgh yeah	3763	A
yes sir	3763	A
well what do you think of Howse	3763	A
who is the coach for the pitchers	3763	A
yes	3763	A
his assistant	3763	A
um-hum	3763	A
i really wish they could	3763	A
see fit to get rid of Howse	3763	A
no no i really don't	3763	A
and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of Howse and i'm not fond of Grieves	3763	A
yeah	3763	A
well i'm just gullible enough that i think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right	3763	A
and i'm sure well	3763	A
oh i know i know so but i would like so much	3763	A
for these Rangers to get their act together and give um	3763	A
oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs	3763	A
i understand	3763	A
well	3763	A
i just oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and let's us have-	3763	A
do work in a large organization now	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
oh yeah that's pretty big	3724	A
i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees	3724	A
i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um	3724	A
besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss	3724	A
yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one	3724	A
right everyone's so integral	3724	A
um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too	3724	A
well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know- in a larger	3724	A
really in health care uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh vacation and	3724	A
and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits	3724	A
uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without	3724	A
um-hum um-hum	3724	A
right that really gets prohibitive	3724	A
yes i've heard that too	3724	A
it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um	3724	A
my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't	3724	A
he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the security of an organization's benefits	3724	A
it- it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand	3724	A
um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it	3724	A
the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical	3724	A
yeah	3724	A
you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh	3724	A
a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer	3724	A
so as as of this date my husband and my kids are free because_1 they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if	3724	A
exactly	3724	A
um well i- i work in a actually it's sort of an odd situation right now but uh	3724	B
i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization	3724	B
and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago	3724	B
but it's it's not really a large organization but uh nearly- nearly five hundred people	3724	B
yeah how about_1 yourself are you	3724	B
that's	3724	B
uh-huh	3724	B
hum	3724	B
yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh	3724	B
ooh yeah i i think it it's probably- the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah-	3724	B
yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's	3724	B
it's generally important	3724	B
but	3724	B
um um-hum	3724	B
what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things	3724	B
yeah	3724	B
yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent	3724	B
yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean- it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses	3724	B
and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations	3724	B
also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization	3724	B
and uh	3724	B
i you- you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them_1 i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um	3724	B
um typically let's see uh typically the myself i- i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in to- for them to be covered but it was pretty economical	3724	B
um especially relative to just buying your own health care package	3724	B
yeah and so you know- so that's that's handy uh you know i think that it- i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead	3724	B
uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary	3724	B
and which is which is pretty amazing	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
right are	3724	B
oh well um-hum yeah that's good- i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think	3724	B
um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
oh uh-huh copayment uh uh-huh	3724	B
right	3724	B
yeah i- i mean i	3724	B
typically- you- typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um	3724	B
you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping	3724	B
well how do you feel about um putting an elderly family family member in a nursing home	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah oh i agree i it's it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel um	3702	A
i- i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families	3702	A
and yet i understand um well we may be facing that with my grandmother she lives- is living near my parents out in California	3702	A
and they this year they moved her into a um retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care	3702	A
but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and	3702	A
it's it's difficult because i know my mother feels really um torn about it she doesn't want to	3702	A
to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the the place is like um	3702	A
i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and	3702	A
um and yet it's a real burden to her to have to to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah i uh i was thinking you know it might	3702	A
i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there	3702	A
um because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's it's been negative where the	3702	A
and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time	3702	A
then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've i've been to other places where you know the people have told me um this is a really good place the people here really care about us so	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah well no um but all the years that i've been alive she has um for the last thirty years or so	3702	A
it's Central California	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
yeah well this is Fresno uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
i'm not too happy about the idea although	3702	B
i do realize that sometimes it becomes necessary to do that or to have round the clock kind of health- care available in the house	3702	B
which often is is not that um easy to to do sometimes it really is easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be given	3702	B
i'm very happy that in my life so far i have not had to do that kind of a thing um	3702	B
my own mother lived with us for some years and uh just died peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life and uh i never had to face that personally	3702	B
and uh what do you think you might do in such a situation	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
oh	3702	B
oh yes	3702	B
i see	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
uh-huh	3702	B
that's right um-hum	3702	B
yeah people are just not as home as much as they used to be um sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet and	3702	B
um and therefore uh they have to leave the older person all the by themselves or with the care of somebody else and some of the diseases that uh older people have uh do require more intensive surveillance	3702	B
so uh it it isn't easy i suppose one of the	3702	B
uh best things if you are considering a nursing home is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations i know i always trust the opinion of a	3702	B
close friend uh above just what i might read about a place if somebody i knew and cared about liked a place and said no this was good and	3702	B
we were happy about the personnel and the care et cetera and so forth i would it certainly would go up in my estimation	3702	B
and uh sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best uh place is um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
yeah	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
well there's hope i guess uh has uh your grandmother always lived in California	3702	B
oh	3702	B
i see yeah	3702	B
yeah what part of California is that	3702	B
oh i see we used to live out there in the San Jose area so uh you know i'm kind of familiar with the state of California and like it very much yeah	3702	B
but um uh it's uh it's a difficult situation uh sometimes also when you get involved in the	3702	B
in those residences for the elderly the retirement homes and and also uh maybe even the nursing division of a residence home	3702	B
um it's tremendously expensive and sometimes they ask you to uh	3702	B
um well where are some of the places you've been	3794	B
um-hum	3794	B
well i've been a lot of different places uh	3794	B
Hawaii Japan Europe	3794	B
and and-	3794	B
most of the fifty	3794	B
i haven't been to Alaska yet	3794	B
yeah i thought we might go up on the uh inland ferry that goes up there from uh from British-	3794	B
right	3794	B
yes	3794	B
oh yeah it's a long desolate stretch but well desolate in that it's all uh the same scenery after a while just like driving in the desert you know after a while it all looks the same	3794	B
huh	3794	B
no no	3794	B
well actually Hawaii is getting cheap too because uh	3794	B
with the economic uh	3794	B
situation- uh situation we're in they've lowered the prices uh quite a bit	3794	B
where do you stay when you go to Virginia on the beach	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
yeah i bet	3794	B
well if he's a landscape architect he ought to like Washington DC in the daylight hours	3794	B
your dad's in the military	3794	B
retired- retired	3794	B
well being from uh living in Texas you probably like cool weather on your uh vacations at least we do	3794	B
uh	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
well usually vacation time July August September it's time to go somewhere else	3794	B
oh yeah	3794	B
um	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
no no i haven't	3794	B
yeah i saw the Sixty- Sixty Minutes also last year we went to uh the Oregon coast and- and that is really beautiful	3794	B
and it's also unlike California completely because it's cool enough that you don't have uh the surfers much because they need protective clothing you know	3794	B
and- and uh there's really uh several nice places to stay along the coast there	3794	B
we stayed at what was called the uh kite capital of the world what was the name of that city- place	3794	B
Lincoln City	3794	B
and it is really nice uh we a very nice place on the beach and very reasonably priced compared to California particularly	3794	B
so- in fact most of the	3794	B
that's right most of the Californians that uh want to stay on the coast apparently the families and so forth they come up to Oregon and Washington coast to stay because it's much uh more economical	3794	B
yeah we've we've been up that way and well this that trip we also went to uh Vancouver and out to uh Victoria which is very nice	3794	B
well you got you haven't been to California either then	3794	B
well if you go to California don't go to Los Angeles unless you really want to just see the movie stars set up and so forth	3794	B
but uh San Diego and San Francisco are both very nice right	3794	B
i don't know about you but i haven't had any trouble having any fun on vacation	3794	A
i can't think of any place i wouldn't want to go to take one	3794	A
oh i know a real good place is Virginia	3794	A
it's real nice	3794	A
it has mountains beach whatever you want	3794	A
have you been in any great places lately	3794	A
oh now i haven't been there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
you plan on going	3794	A
oh yeah now i'd like to go uh to Canada on the boat	3794	A
my parents went not long ago	3794	A
or to Key West have you ever been to Key West	3794	A
is it pretty	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
oh no	3794	A
no i've never been huh is it very expensive	3794	A
not compared to Hawaii huh	3794	A
really	3794	A
well that's nice to know	3794	A
well that's good	3794	A
um yeah i've been to Virginia Beach and i've been up to the uh homestead in hot springs in the mountains it's real nice	3794	A
and uh oh let's see i've been to Charlottesville through Monticello uh my husband's a a landscape architect and he uh he really liked that and to see Thomas Jefferson's home	3794	A
yeah now we we went there went there to stay at the Army Navy club with my dad and that was real nice that was real nice	3794	A
uh no he used to be he he's a retired attorney now uh but he was the uh he was uh uh	3794	A
in the reserves for quite a long time and uh he's active in something right now i forgot what it is	3794	A
but um i he's somehow connected still with it	3794	A
yeah sometimes- sometimes you know when it in when it's getting really hot in Texas you know you want to go someplace cool	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
have you ever been to Arkansas	3794	A
now i've i've been but not to way up at near Branson oh i hear it's just booming up there now	3794	A
up around Silver- Silver- Silver Dollar City have you been there	3794	A
i heard on uh what was it Sixty Minutes or something a lot of the country western um people are starting to build their nightclubs up there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
really	3794	A
how about population is it very uh crowded	3794	A
hum	3794	A
oh	3794	A
oh i bet	3794	A
really i bet but- but it's not as crowded either	3794	A
huh	3794	A
yeah i'd like to go up around Washington sometime to see	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
well i think the furthest west i've ever gotten is the Grand Canyon	3794	A
no huh-uh no	3794	A
oh i won't	3794	A
no no no	3794	A
really	3794	A
i know my grandparents have been to San Francisco years ago and they said it was real nice-	3794	A
well i could do with a lot less than that	3782	B
i live in Dallas	3782	B
oh good well i live in Plano in that case	3782	B
oh yeah i do yeah	3782	B
yes	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
i know	3782	B
and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i don't know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and that's how it started with uh four percent five percent	3782	B
and all of a sudden here we are now	3782	B
and it's horrible	3782	B
well	3782	B
it's true but they did without it all those years	3782	B
and they keep talking about the state tax and they'll probably put one in and they'll have this too so	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
well i hope it doesn't but you know how it goes so	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
raise them	3782	B
oh	3782	B
oh well it will	3782	B
probably the first season	3782	B
but they're funny about things like that here	3782	B
they really are when i came here you couldn't buy beer couldn't buy a drink nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know	3782	B
so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
oh that is	3782	B
oh	3782	B
hm	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
that is	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
hm	3782	B
oh yeah that is	3782	B
uh uh they well they do a little bit but um	3782	B
it's it's like next to nothing i've seen it it's on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
it costs what	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
really	3782	B
God	3782	B
yeah so you haven't been here very long	3782	B
you haven't been here very long	3782	B
two years	3782	B
um-hum	3782	B
uh yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
no i don't i'm a nurse i work down at Presbyterian	3782	B
yeah oh it is you know they're supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least that's what i heard that you could- could get to do ten calls	3782	B
and this is like the seventeenth	3782	B
yeah so it's great	3782	B
so what do you think about the uh income taxes	3782	A
where do you live	3782	A
okay i live in Dallas too	3782	A
okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i-	3782	A
yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax	3782	A
it i think it's like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there	3782	A
Washington DC was only six percent	3782	A
and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half	3782	A
it was only four percent	3782	A
really	3782	A
um-hum um-hum	3782	A
what	3782	A
since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because_1 Virginia does have a state tax	3782	A
um-hum hm	3782	A
yeah it	3782	A
if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset	3782	A
because_1 i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck	3782	A
uh every two weeks and uh if that comes back in	3782	A
i'll be pretty mad because_1 sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know	3782	A
so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax	3782	A
yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes	3782	A
and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing	3782	A
they're putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because_1 of that yeah they said uh to build okay	3782	A
apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds	3782	A
and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds	3782	A
well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes	3782	A
but it seems like it would pay itself off	3782	A
so you know what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know	3782	A
yeah so you know	3782	A
yeah things like that you know	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
no huh	3782	A
um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe	3782	A
but uh like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties	3782	A
and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh	3782	A
on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up	3782	A
you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year	3782	A
and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year	3782	A
but that gets real expensive	3782	A
do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know	3782	A
um	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks	3782	A
so it's only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your property- personal property tax	3782	A
for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess	3782	A
that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out	3782	A
what's that	3782	A
i've been here about two years now	3782	A
but uh in the two years i've i've been here i've been through i've had two cars	3782	A
so i've never really like you know	3782	A
i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax	3782	A
on the car other than what i paid when i registered- uh registered the car	3782	A
so that's the only thing i can really think of	3782	A
so so do you work for TI or you just doing this	3782	A
okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool	3782	A
oh do they really	3782	A
yeah i- i don't know how the thing works uh	3782	A
oh really all right you	3782	A
yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be	3759	B
i haven't had any real uh recent problems with that i've been a little bit leery i have mail ordered uh a uh video camera from New York	3759	B
and i was worried that that might uh cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
just can you hold on just one sec	3759	B
i got a six year old that's going out of off of his mind he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
do you buy um do you buy much mail order	3759	B
do you buy much mail order	3759	B
uh-huh have you had any problems with that at all	3759	B
oh uh-huh	3759	B
oh yeah	3759	B
well some some places are good about sending them_1 out by UPS or or other ways but	3759	B
i think most of the time i uh maybe it's just the kind of shopper i am i will uh decide on the kind of thing i want and	3759	B
try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and and generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but	3759	B
uh maybe it's the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i'm saying	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh well at least they're	3759	B
trying to uh give you some kind of concession there	3759	B
i'm trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back	3759	B
i bought some clothing i don't know if you get these Lands' End catalogs	3759	B
they uh make mail order clothing and most of it's very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years	3759	B
and um they've been very good with the exception of one that had the uh button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it	3759	B
and uh	3759	B
no they're real good in fact i've had the shirt for uh actually i probably had it for over a year	3759	B
and the only reason i called them_1 on it is because i'd had similar shirts that held up for several years	3759	B
and uh they said uh regardless that you've you know worn it for a year or over a year we'll uh take it back and give you a new one	3759	B
huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
right	3759	B
well i think that's uh that's really just good business you know	3759	B
if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do you've got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back	3759	B
you know that's like i've seen on this mail order if they were uh skin flints about it and wouldn't take it back	3759	B
i mean they they uh depend on that kind of a reputation so much	3759	B
you know	3759	B
oh yeah this they're sporting aren't they uh-huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
uh-huh you said you'd bought uh cars recently what kind of cars have you {boughten}	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
uh-huh you haven't had any problems with it though huh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
what's your feeling about American versus foreign and	3759	B
did you hear the topic Carol	3759	A
right	3759	A
oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been	3759	A
you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted	3759	A
you know for a good part	3759	A
yes	3759	A
oh	3759	A
i think i think the only problem i've had in the last two or three years is i was- i was in Germany a couple of years ago and	3759	A
bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didn't receive everything but you know that's you sort of take that chance you buy something like that	3759	A
pardon me	3759	A
oh a little bit	3759	A
no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands	3759	A
i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item	3759	A
you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and	3759	A
two days after i bought them i picked them_1 up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh	3759	A
get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over	3759	A
he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference	3759	A
which i thought was fair	3759	A
sure	3759	A
but overall i think i'm uh	3759	A
no	3759	A
right	3759	A
any trouble getting it back	3759	A
sure	3759	A
i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they don't have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything	3759	A
so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
oh absolutely	3759	A
yeah mail- mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk	3759	A
right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if you're dissatisfied with it in anyway and they're very easy get along- get along with and they don't mind taking something back	3759	A
i bought a Lincoln	3759	A
and uh	3759	A
up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit	3759	A
it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now	3759	A
no not really you know it's like the old uh saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true	3759	A
but they don't build them like they used to but	3759	A
uh just about_1 um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last ten or twenty years	3704	B
and um i guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field	3704	B
that uh of course when i was growing up not very many women went to work at all most everyone was at home	3704	B
and some of my friends whose mothers were teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their mothers weren't at home	3704	B
yes and uh but nowadays it's just so common	3704	B
a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that i've had children i've stopped uh working	3704	B
that it's kind of embarrassing when i go to a store and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work number please and then i don't have a work number to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
yes	3704	B
that's true	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right	3704	B
right	3704	B
no and it wasn't like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it's it's pennies but for them it's just a socialized behavior	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
that's true that's probably true	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right me too	3704	B
well that's good in in in our homes we all have a lot- uh much more high tech compared to the people ten twenty years ago	3704	B
right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right we	3704	B
load up on all of the conveniences and they're not special to us anymore just a	3704	B
necessity and there's the people who don't have televisions are	3704	B
are uh you know unusual in our society	3704	B
um-hum um-hum	3704	B
what was the topic	3704	A
i said uh	3704	A
right- right	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah	3704	A
yeah really	3704	A
uh oh	3704	A
there there was a stigma attached to it	3704	A
and- and a necessity	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
uh-huh	3704	A
yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i- i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work	3704	A
yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i- i thought well	3704	A
you know in a lot of different ways i- i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much it's changed i mean uh	3704	A
uh i live in Houston but i'm i'm in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami it's i mean honestly English is almost a second language now	3704	A
uh you know with all the uh influx of uh South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh	3704	A
i- i guess a majority in Miami you know of- course in Houston uh you've got the people from Mexico so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh	3704	A
the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh	3704	A
you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and- and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country	3704	A
plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh	3704	A
you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted	3704	A
uh you know thirty years ago uh a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event	3704	A
and- and- and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i i'm not sure of that	3704	A
oh yeah	3704	A
that's right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event	3704	A
and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month they'd have a stroke	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
oh well- and you know microwaves	3704	A
oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have three televisions you know and i really they're two well	3704	A
one of them_1 is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in six months i mean it's there you know	3704	A
and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones	3704	A
um	3704	A
that's right that's right	3704	A
yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh	3704	A
issue i've run across a few people before that- that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know people look at them_1 yeah like yeah you know but-	3704	A
and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not	3704	A
okay Carolyn what kind of dress do you have to wear when you go to work	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
uh well in my company we do have to dress up and they don't say that you have to um dress in a dress for women but they strongly urge it	3701	A
so it's it's kind of an unwritten law	3701	A
right	3701	A
exactly it's puts puts forth a better image it's uh my company doesn't usually have casual days we had our first one in four at least since i've been there which is four years not too long ago and	3701	A
i didn't feel comfortable dressing like many people came in like warm ups and no and i	3701	A
yeah and i don't feel i- i wore you know a nice pair of pants and and blouse but i- i- i just couldn't feel comfortable in my warm ups around everybody at work	3701	A
oh well it was just recently so i don't know if they'll do it again the way some people looked i would doubt it	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
i don't know i it just seems if you want to get ahead or even if you just want everybody to think of you you know as a a professionally you you don't just want to have the real casual look all the time	3701	A
well we've got two hundred people in our office but we're the corporate office so um it's it's relatively large but i mean i have a job very much longer so i- i don't want to say too much	3701	A
exactly we have to hold the image for everybody	3701	A
i would like to you know i dress as nicely as my budget allows	3701	A
and and you know i mean it's it's a lot better than some people there and it's not as nice because i don't have the money of others you know what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
so you don't work with many women	3701	A
and i work with all women	3701	A
and my husband does well not all but the majority and my husband he works in a bank and he works with all women	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
at least at the lower levels you know	3701	A
okay	3701	A
what about season to season do you change	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
exactly i- i do the same and that's what basically keeps my wardrobe i may wear a few really warm dresses in the winter but i don't i don't change a whole lot because it's it's we're environmentally controlled you know	3701	A
you end up wearing the same thing	3701	A
below the knee	3701	A
i- i- i don't have nice knees they're kind of knobby so	3701	A
on the knobby side i what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
halfway up the knee	3701	A
you must have better	3701	A
oh okay-	3701	A
oh okay	3701	A
i- i- i'm thinking halfway between the knee and your say your hip	3701	A
well it that it is but i know a lot of women who who do wear those skirts and they have been reprimanded in our company before	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
also i was going to just mention that i wear what you know my my wardrobe- my wardrobe how should i say it i wear what i can fit into	3701	A
oh yeah fat months thin months you know	3701	A
exactly the same for me but i'm working on it but i'm not doing a very good job at this point	3701	A
i haven't gotten serious yet	3701	A
that's right that's right but i'm so used to eating now it's hard to get out of the habit	3701	A
uh i can actually wear anything i want to however i generally wear uh suits or dresses	3701	B
how about_1 you	3701	B
well the company that i work for uh we it's very casual we don't see any people there's a plant out in the back and then i'm in the office section	3701	B
and we always had casual day on Friday which meant you could wear jeans or whatever you wanted to which to me dressing down is you know like wearing pants and a jacket or something	3701	B
but uh	3701	B
even though i don't have to dress during the day you know in anything that dressy i still feel better i feel more professional when i'm dressed up	3701	B
you're kidding that's casual	3701	B
uh-huh	3701	B
would i assume that perhaps they did that one time and that was it	3701	B
well that's what i always thought actually uh the gals in our customer service department quite honestly came in every day in what i considered casual but	3701	B
um-hum do you work for a large company	3701	B
well and it and it affects uh you know being in the corporate office how you have to dress too do you	3701	B
do you tend to dress up toward your superiors as the books kind of	3701	B
i understand	3701	B
um-hum	3701	B
uh i have never i really have not worked for very many companies that i had a female role model	3701	B
um the we have some i'm sure in our corporate office but i've not met them yet but uh the last few jobs i've had well there was two jobs ago there was a girl in the office uh that i tended to try to emulate somewhat but uh	3701	B
no not too many	3701	B
i've	3701	B
do you really	3701	B
majority	3701	B
i'm sure that's true i used to be in banking and you're right the majority of the people there	3701	B
uh	3701	B
exactly-	3701	B
what oh someone never mind that's a call coming in but	3701	B
we'll pass that	3701	B
um i probably get a little bit more casual in summer	3701	B
in then in that i would wear a more casual top under some of my suits	3701	B
than i would wear in the winter	3701	B
but our offices are rather cold so i i'll tend to try to dress warmly too	3701	B
well tell me another thing	3701	B
uh how do you wear your skirt lengths	3701	B
well i they go from everywhere to just like halfway up the knee to uh mid calf	3701	B
not halfway not halfway up my leg halfway up my knee	3701	B
okay my half of my knee might	3701	B
uh and my	3701	B
really	3701	B
you mean you have fat days and thin days	3701	B
well right now i'm having a fat month i know half of my clothes don't fit me since the holiday season	3701	B
well we have to get all of this junk food out of the house from Christmas	3701	B
well	3701	B
yeah	3750	B
oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time	3750	B
except for what i call living now which is which is very close to camping yeah you know i i camped in the Boy Scouts and uh	3750	B
you know my dad and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because_1 i was in construction	3750	B
and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it	3750	B
and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous	3750	B
so my buddy and i we just camped and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it	3750	B
course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's a couple of years older than me and uh	3750	B
he graduated and went off to college and and during- during summer we'd camp out at the lake	3750	B
and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in the morning go skiing	3750	B
you know in in the afternoon you know it's still four o'clock you got four hours of day light good skiing left	3750	B
and uh it was great	3750	B
but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really	3750	B
oh yeah well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago we didn't have a phone	3750	B
and they didn't have phone lines i mean there was you just couldn't get a phone	3750	B
and uh we're on the we're third from the end on the electric string	3750	B
so uh and we're at the end of the mail route like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas	3750	B
but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home	3750	B
one of these twelve by forty eight's that got repaid	3750	B
and uh i swapped them_1 a Cadillac for it and uh put it out here on the land figuring i'd build a house some day you know i'm in construction and uh	3750	B
you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know	3750	B
and uh i came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was packed everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving	3750	B
and i said where she said out to the trailer and i said oh no she said yep i said okay	3750	B
so we've been uh roughing it out here about three years but it's not bad i we got color TV and microwave i mean you know it's not horrible but it's it's a lot like camping	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
sure	3750	B
became civilized	3750	B
yep my mom goes camping you know she she takes her uh motor home	3750	B
and but you know she has a lot of fun	3750	B
and mostly it's just a way to she she goes to dog shows see she shows dogs and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel	3750	B
and so she you know takes the motor home	3750	B
and she made a deal with my dad that she'd take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing and she but if he'd buy her a motor home so he did	3750	B
but as far as as camping my wife and i had plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the you know Highway One there in in California	3750	B
uh as soon as we get this house finished i'm gonna need a vacation	3750	B
okay so you enjoy camping	3750	A
yeah uh-huh	3750	A
uh-huh	3750	A

um so my dad loved fishing and camping so we'd go up first we went up just uh with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot dogs by the fire or whatever	3750	A
but then later my mom and dad got a camper so uh we've kind of moved up yeah a little bit in the world	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
no	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah oh that's a that'll be pretty that's really pretty out there	3750	A
so a lot of nice places	3750	A
Mark i was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time	3737	A
really have you had lessons guitar lessons	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band	3737	A
well and bad hours too	3737	A
huh well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i don't play very well but uh i wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as um	3737	A
i usually	3737	A
you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's Christmas time or a birthday or uh we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some	3737	A
um crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
that's true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
hum	3737	A
sounds like it	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
that's awful	3737	A
that's pretty funny well i uh since my kids started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a Pilgrim feast and things and so i've done some	3737	A
right so i've done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um	3737	A
it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at school and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest and read	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
hum	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
well and there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing	3737	A
hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um	3737	A
you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need	3737	A
uh-huh i like that	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
and it's	3737	A
right and it's functional so that you're always needing you know it's nice to do your Christmas cards	3737	A
yeah sounds good	3737	A
yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like um we've done a lot	3737	A
too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the garage a lot	3737	B
uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they weren't very good	3737	B
and uh so i didn't really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there	3737	B
yeah i was i was in several bands when i was	3737	B
some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because_1 they were all a little pig headed and	3737	B
self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves	3737	B
yeah yeah that too	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store	3737	B
so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself	3737	B
um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh	3737	B
if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that	3737	B
but uh	3737	B
it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything	3737	B
my my dad's gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh	3737	B
he didn't get it finished because_1 he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh	3737	B
he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over	3737	B
it's like Dad you're doing it wrong	3737	B
you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
and Halloween and	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah i i work- i work out of the i work at a Renaissance festival down in Waxahachie and uh	3737	B
i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh	3737	B
it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and	3737	B
kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it	3737	B
yeah like my mom sew has sewn for years and years and years and years and years	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah yeah	3737	B
one one one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy	3737	B
i i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and	3737	B
yeah you can do it yourself- do your Christmas cards and invitations and things like that	3737	B
or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall	3737	B
uh i i live in Richardson just outside of Dallas it snowed- snowed just-	3737	B
are you Bob	3751	A
oh okay i am in Waco	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
right down the street	3751	A
oh credit cards my favorite subject	3751	A
oh do i uh	3751	A
yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them_1 a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off	3751	A
and so then you have no money so you use a credit card	3751	A
so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is	3751	A
do you use them a lot	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
oh	3751	A
yeah yeah well that is a good idea	3751	A
that through a Visa	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
huh	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
yeah that is my problem i don't try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know so i have got myself	3751	A
exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now	3751	A
but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them	3751	A
so it is kind of strange	3751	A
oh yeah exactly like the government in	3751	A
in debt for	3751	A
yeah yeah	3751	A
have they put the cap on the interest rates	3751	A
i didn't know if they actually did that or not i know they were i know they were considering it	3751	A
uh-huh yeah	3751	A
funny how that works isn't it	3751	A
i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety	3751	A
i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it	3751	A
because of the economy yeah	3751	A
exactly	3751	A
i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting	3751	A
yeah i have a credit union	3751	A
yeah they do uh-huh	3751	A
yes i do yes i do a matter of fact	3751	A
uh i work for Channel six	3751	A
it's it's an NBC affiliate down here	3751	A
oh really	3751	A
oh okay where do you work what is your	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
so you probably work with uh	3751	A
uh what is the boy from here	3751	A
you ever work with Davis	3751	A
Davis Iron Work yeah	3751	A
oh okay and uh what else	3751	A
yeah well i live actually in Hewett	3751	A
yeah right outside so that is where Davis Iron Works is	3751	A
uh	3751	A
i don't think i have seen that one i am sure i pass by it or something but i am not sure	3751	A
huh Prime Air	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
okay	3751	A
have you ever been to Marlin	3751	A
i think it is Marlin or Mart they have uh	3751	A
uh a place i guess that would be similar to Prime Air it is called H G H or something like K G H or	3751	A
i can't think of i can't think of the name but	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
oh yeah	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
uh-huh oh i don't like that drive i make that drive sometimes we have stories out there but	3751	A
huh oh really i know	3751	A
oh goodness they they are bad at Hewett too on eighty four they are real bad that is where i got my last ticket	3751	A
so of course i couldn't pay that on a credit-	3751	A
i am in Plano where are you	3751	B
is that right oh okay	3751	B
you mean you use credit cards	3751	B
i bet you used them all up over Christmas	3751	B
and then your are in debt	3751	B
i understand that	3751	B
well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because_1 you get	3751	B
Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way	3751	B
so	3751	B
as long as you pay it off every month it doesn't cost you anything	3751	B
so	3751	B
that is what i	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
but uh	3751	B
i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh	3751	B
if i can get away with paying them_1 off every month it is alright if i don't then it gets expensive	3751	B
well you shouldn't do that you you- you- never- you- you- you never get out of the hole that way	3751	B
kind of like the federal government right	3751	B
never- never get out of debt	3751	B
and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right	3751	B
so	3751	B
no	3751	B
no	3751	B
just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so	3751	B
thou- thou who doesn't need credit gets cheap credit	3751	B
well i think so because the	3751	B
that's right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you	3751	B
we have a Master Card or Visa too	3751	B
you got that one	3751	B
who who do you work for	3751	B
oh	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
i do a lot of work down in Waco a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh	3751	B
Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there	3751	B
GNK	3751	B
Davis Iron yes yep matter of fact i just saw them last week yep	3751	B
are- are you in that part are you in the south part of town now	3751	B
oh yeah okay	3751	B
you know	3751	B
you know uh Parker Machine Tool down there	3751	B
Bobby Parker	3751	B
there is a place in Hewett called it is a new company called Prime Air	3751	B
that is in Hewett just around the corner from Davis Iron Works	3751	B
yeah they make uh	3751	B
humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for you know hospitals homes something like that it's a new kind-	3751	B
uh yeah	3751	B
oh really	3751	B
huh	3751	B
i will have to stop in there i went i have gone through there uh my oldest son goes to A&M and	3751	B
he is working on his Master's- the Navy sent him there for his Master's mostly in Engineering so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty five	3751	B
that is about the last time i have been through Marlin and Mart	3751	B
there is always a state trooper down there you have got to drive careful	3751	B
between Mart and Marlin they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour	3751	B
huh	3751	B
uh-huh	3751	B
okay_1	3713	A
uh do you cook quite a bit	3713	A
that's good practice though	3713	A
i know when i was single it was uh i wouldn't cook much of anything i think one night i sauteed a pound of mushrooms and that was dinner	3713	A
but uh well right now my husband and i live in uh uh subdivision that we have a dinner club {thingy}	3713	A
and what we do is once a month we'll meet at one house and the host will prepare the entree and provide the drinks and then every one else brings something	3713	A
and then it rotates from month to month you get together with four couples so you only host one time	3713	A
it is really nice but uh	3713	A
well	3713	A
we haven't but i think that'd be great you know do Mexican one time or Chinese the next time thinking the next one we get into that i'll do that	3713	A
but basically the host so far have just been picking you know what we have and then they'll let the people know and they'll uh uh ask people to bring something to compliment it but personally i like to prepare something that i could have done ahead of time	3713	A
because i can't talk and cook at the same time uh if i try you know i- i leave ingredients out but uh	3713	A
we're suppose to be hosting next time i'm thinking of about having beef stroganoff because i can do that ahead of time	3713	A
and	3713	A
really	3713	A
now- now is this one of the dishes that you cook	3713	A
it's really simple so don't don't let it uh	3713	A
what do you cook when you go home	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
no what is it	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
that doesn't bother me anyway so	3713	A
oh you sound like my husband he's a garlic freak too	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
do you uh stir fry	3713	A
do you have a wok	3713	A
well i'd call them up	3713	A
probably works just as well	3713	A
that's something you know we don't do all that often and every time we do it i think why don't we cook this way more often because it is healthy you get a lot of vegetables and everything	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
soy sauce	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
uh-huh	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
uh not really actually uh i live by myself and so most of my cooking is pretty basic you know just for myself but i cook when i go home my mom doesn't like to cook so	3713	B
i cook all my parents' meals when i go home and that's about_1 the only opportunity i like to but i just you know	3713	B
hard to get motivated to cook for yourself	3713	B
yeah	3713	B
oh	3713	B
oh	3713	B
that's pretty nice	3713	B
well what kind of things do you usually have i mean do you do you usually have like	3713	B
you know ethnic food do you try a different thing every time or	3713	B
oh sure	3713	B
oh yeah	3713	B
oh yeah my mom does that and freezes it a lot of times	3713	B
yeah	3713	B
huh-uh	3713	B
one of my mom's bailiwick	3713	B
i was going to say i kind of i do not know i do	3713	B
odd things i guess	3713	B
um i guess last time i was home was at Christmas and i cooked um	3713	B
i bought some really good beef tenderloin at um Ralph's in Snider Plaza	3713	B
and um i had i my parents have a deep freeze so i bought like oh God i want to say it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze and so i cooked one of them you know and	3713	B
basically have you ever used that DV sauce	3713	B
it's like um	3713	B
a meat a beef enhancer or something like that	3713	B
i mean it might not i- i haven't really looked at the ingredients and it may be one of those things where if if	3713	B
it may have MSG in it i really haven't really looked i do not think it does but it might but	3713	B
uh you know i kind of like sprinkle some of that on it and then take like	3713	B
you know pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them_1 down into the meat	3713	B
and then yeah and then bake it you know and it it always turns out really good i mean course you know the better the the the quality of the meat the better it turns out but	3713	B
you know and if you can leave it out on the counter for a little bit and you know to soak in the the garlic and everything you know that works pretty well but you know that's kind of that's kind of basic and i can do some Chinese and junk like that but	3713	B
some sometimes um i had one but i loaned it to somebody and they never gave it back	3713	B
so i kind of just use a skillet really	3713	B
oh yeah	3713	B
sure and the easy see now that would be an easy thing to do for the dinner party because you could do that in advance you know you i would just get like um	3713	B
you could use do chicken or beef either one and you know kind of chop it up into about inch cubes you know and the marinade i think that is like um	3713	B
oh like a cup of water and maybe three tablespoons of	3713	B
soy and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worcestershire- Worcestershire Worcestershire- or whatever sauce i can't pronounce it	3713	B
i always call it Lea and Perrins because_1 i can't say the name of it and uh garlic and chopped green onions and then you know chop up all of your meat like the night before and stick it in a tupperware dish with the	3713	B
you know with the stuff and let it marinade over night and then just strain out you know the juice and um	3713	B
you know then then you know stir fry the meat and um you can get the cans of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and	3713	B
you can put mushroom	3713	B
think of the job benefits you have	3789	A
the dental insurance	3789	A
um do you work for TI	3789	A
okay hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
hum	3789	A
yeah	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
hm that does sound pretty bogus	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
hm	3789	A
that sounds kind of strange	3789	A
who's your- who's your dental care through	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
um	3789	A
ours is through uh Cigna	3789	A
and it's not too bad i mean i haven't	3789	A
i haven't been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits	3789	A
and uh they haven't- been bad they haven't uh they've been pretty good how about_1 your uh do you have an HMO or	3789	A
you you went to like a regular plan	3789	A
oh okay	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
did it get expensive or	3789	A
um-hum um-hum	3789	A
um-hum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh i personally i- i think HMO's are {scammy} now just because_1 uh it's only five dollars a visit every time i go that's not bad okay and it's five dollars prescription	3789	A
every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway	3789	A
but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking	3789	A
you know and	3789	A
so if i go to make a like i- i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache- i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor	3789	A
and they wouldn't let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just- just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and i'm	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
well i was just really annoyed with them_1 because_1 i uh i- i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you don't give me an appointment i'm just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill	3789	A
before anything happens they're like well wait another day and call us back and i'm like i don't wanna wait another day i want an appointment now	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
yeah it's it's real handy once you're you know if you like my roommate broke his arm	3789	A
and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that	3789	A
and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like	3789	A
i don't know i'm i'm only twenty four years old you know i don't really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years i've only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical	3789	A
so you know for me	3789	A
you know i don't i don't see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know	3789	A
so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible	3789	A
i guess i could've done pretty good with the five dollar visit	3789	A
so	3789	A
wow that's a lot	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
hum yeah Kaiser's- expensive i mean i think it's uh this year it's like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars	3789	A
yeah that works- that works out pretty handy	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
no yeah	3789	A
it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best	3789	A
well i- i think uh so far they've been pretty- pretty good except the medical uh	3789	B
not not the medical the dental insurance	3789	B
yeah i- yeah i think um	3789	B
i know i went to have a tooth pulled	3789	B
and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldn't uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing condition	3789	B
you know how you wait you wait as long as you can	3789	B
sometimes to- to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it really- i- i just thought that was that was pretty bad	3789	B
and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell- fell off and uh	3789	B
they paid for the the cap but they wouldn't pay for the build up	3789	B
and i didn't understand that either	3789	B
uh well uh it's it's a part of Aetna	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
well i had an HMO up to this year i switched	3789	B
yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh	3789	B
you know because	3789	B
yeah it's gotten expensive because_1 right now i'm i'm only- i only have myself so i don't have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
really	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
right	3789	B
right	3789	B
right	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah that was a problem that i had with them_1 toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and	3789	B
and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away	3789	B
and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them_1 i got okay but uh and i didn't go back	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah that's what i thought about later i would've probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
right	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah after i really thought about it some more the i- i really could've done that but um	3789	B
i was hospitalized uh	3789	B
uh about_1 three years ago i had some surgery	3789	B
and Kaiser was really good for that because_1 i didn't have to pay any of it at all	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
wow	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
well my uh my Kaiser premium	3789	B
would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year	3789	B
and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
so i went back to Aetna because i- i won't have to pay anything	3789	B
and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick	3789	B
you know	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
where in California you live	3708	B
okay i was down that way once but i don't think i remember that is it on the coast	3708	B
i went all the way down to Imperial Beach once that's far as i went	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yes i guess we're gonna talk about camping is that right	3708	B
okay	3708	B
well yeah my wife and i like to camp um usually just on short trips like a weekend or long weekend	3708	B
and we generally go to uh State or National parks	3708	B
uh-huh yeah well we don't really care for fishing anything that that resembles work uh so we just uh what we do is hike and take pictures that's about all	3708	B
well Texas has a pretty nice system of state parks we've got um state parks just all over the place on different kinds of terrain and most of them	3708	B
uh	3708	B
well Texas has every thing from desert to uh swamp so i don't think they have too many	3708	B
they don't have too many swamps in Arizona i don't think i don't think i've uh seen too many swamps in Arizona	3708	B
now we may do some camping- camping in Arizona though i've got uh my uh brother and sister and father all live in Sedonia now Sedonia yeah	3708	B
what is it	3708	B
Mayer	3708	B
oh yeah uh	3708	B
i- i think i remember going through there is that between Prescott and Jerome or over the other way	3708	B
uh-huh well it be	3708	B
yeah i think i do remember a little wide place in the road called Mayer well anyway they uh everybody there says that you know there are places you can camp uh right around Sedonia there are	3708	B
yeah	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yeah well we we do we like actually we like to get off uh where there aren't too many people around	3708	B
we did find a nice uh prospect uh down on the gulf	3708	B
um there's a uh national wildlife- wildlife refuge called Urandus i don't know if you've heard of it that's where the whooping cranes go in the winter or at least where a lot of them go	3708	B
and uh there's and island right off that called Matagorda and uh you can take a ferry boat out there and it's uh completely uh pretty much anyway complete wilderness island	3708	B
sort of like a big sand bar you know you wanna make sure there aren't any big storms coming	3708	B
but uh then you can uh take a uh take a little bus across the island to the to the gulf side rather than the bay side and uh	3708	B
it's really nice out there lots of sea birds	3708	B
all at once or all at once	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yeah well i sort of like to feel less tied down rather than more tied down when i go camping and	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
well i really like Arizona i like uh uh couple times this last year i've made it up to Jerome just to enjoy the altitude and everything and it's really	3708	B
neat up there somehow	3708	B
i met the town historian	3708	B
uh it's near National- it's near uh San Diego it's called National City	3708	A
yeah it's just a little rinky-dink town but	3708	A
most people don't go there it's really not a good neighborhood	3708	A
yeah it's nicer down there	3708	A
unfortunately i need to be near near the naval base so	3708	A
my choice of living quarters is limited so um are you ready to begin	3708	A
right	3708	A
okay i'll push the button hang on	3708	A
{alrighty} there we go	3708	A
so do you go camping at all	3708	A
yeah my husband and i like going for the long weekends we usually like going up to one of the camping grounds that have a lake near it	3708	A
because_1 we like to fish and camp	3708	A
yeah i- i like hiking unfortunately around here there's not too many spots to do stuff like that	3708	A
yeah i'm from Arizona and they've got a lot of it there too	3708	A
they've also got desert desert uh i don't know what you call it but	3708	A
sites in the desert they have a special name for it	3708	A
i don't think i'd like the swamp but mountains and deserts	3708	A
huh	3708	A
no it's pretty much dry	3708	A
oh really do you know where Mayer's at	3708	A
Mayer outside Prescott	3708	A
yeah	3708	A
over the other way it's actually if you blinked you'd miss it	3708	A
oh there's a lot of beautiful camping places around Sedonia and they're getting they're getting more of them_1	3708	A
they're just doing it slowly but surely	3708	A
but um i like the rustic kind of camping	3708	A
yeah	3708	A
uh-huh	3708	A
oh that'd be neat	3708	A
really	3708	A
right	3708	A
that sounds like it'd be nice	3708	A
yeah unfortunately my husband and i haven't been able to go camping because_1 i just had two kids two- two boys and	3708	A
huh	3708	A
well no no i spaced them out about a year a part	3708	A
but until they get a little bit older we really don't want to take them_1 out camping with us	3708	A
yeah when i go camping i like to get out and hike and do things and when you have little kids you really can't do that very much	3708	A
right that's the object of it you know get out and feel free and do things you don't normally get to do	3708	A
but um yeah we haven't got to go lately but when we go we we're from Arizona so when we go back on vacation next year we'll get to go	3708	A
which should be nice	3708	A
it is actually	3708	A
well i suppose we both have credit cards	3781	B
yeah	3781	B
well i do use them um	3781	B
i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i- i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to	3781	B
um	3781	B
but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh	3781	B
they all can build up	3781	B
uh i think they're handy i just get	3781	B
uh i don't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks	3781	B
when you go shopping	3781	B
well do you use credit cards	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
your grandmother huh	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
that's good	3781	B
oh that's that's wonderful	3781	B
well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing it's really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building	3781	B
but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
um yeah	3781	B
well that's good i'm looking right now i'm kind- kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them_1 have gotten higher	3781	B
and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a	3781	B
Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didn't write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think it's eighteen percent or something so	3781	B
think i want to find something that has a lower rate	3781	B
no i haven't	3781	B
is is that the one from Sears	3781	B
okay	3781	B
okay	3781	B
uh-huh oh	3781	B
oh they give you money back for using your credit card	3781	B
oh i didn't know that	3781	B
hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards	3781	B
i worked with- at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take	3781	B
until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so	3781	B
you know now they'll take the Discover but i still don't know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard	3781	B
but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and	3781	B
American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two	3781	B
um-hum yeah i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldn't be able to use them	3781	B
but uh i- i do like my Dillard's i have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop	3781	B
and i do- do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores	3781	B
but	3781	B
well yes no not too much more about credit cards	3781	B
okay well	3781	B
good talking to you Beth	3781	B
good luck	3781	B
you too bye	3781	B
um-hum yeah they seem to be a part of life	3781	A
yeah how do you use them	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah i use a few i um	3781	A
i watched my grandmother go into debt on them and so i've and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so	3781	A
basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um	3781	A
i generally and my husband it turns out i've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month	3781	A
so that we don't pay any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
yeah yeah that's what i feel	3781	A
so	3781	A
um-hum it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them_1 in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come but sometimes i forget and	3781	A
so you know a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um	3781	A
yeah have you ever used Discover card	3781	A
yeah i'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off but you know	3781	A
um i think Sears originally put it out but it's um it's pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take Discover	3781	A
and there's no annual service fee which is good you know and then um	3781	A
they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back	3781	A
yeah basically that's it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but i'm not sure	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah i think it's best to keep the number down that you have	3781	A
so	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
well do you have anything else to say or	3781	A
okay i don't think i do either so well it was good talking to you	3781	A
okay have a good evening bye-bye	3781	A
do you	3707	B
how old is it	3707	B
uh you you're you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think	3707	B
well	3707	B
i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh i've had dogs through the years right now i've got two	3707	B
and three cats but	3707	B
uh and uh my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix and we watched it this summer for two to three months and it wasn't trained quite fully either	3707	B
and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog	3707	B
i don't know i i'm old fashioned and when i got my my dogs when they when they did something i hollered at them_1 and threw them_1 outside they say that's not the way to do it now but you're just supposed to	3707	B
no just just you- put them_1 outside i guess unless you catch- catch them_1 in the act	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
no you- no you don't wanna do that but uh	3707	B
does- does- does it just wanna sniff around and	3707	B
does it just wanna sniff around and play when it's outside	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
have- have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
that's nothing huh	3707	B
well it it it'll it'll catch on pretty soon i'll i'll i'll {betcha} i i have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever and she's gone the other way because she's so old she doesn't have much control	3707	B
so we're battling with that problem and she still feels good uh she can't hear worth a darn or see very well but she's got a great appetite and she knows we're there by smell	3707	B
she'll be sixteen in May	3707	B
and yeah but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years so we're putting up with all her accidents	3707	B
um-hum	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
does it oh	3707	B
uh-huh	3707	B
uh you know maybe you need- you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes	3707	B
oh	3707	B
well you know where we went we went to the junior college Richland	3707	B
and we took my my daughter was living at home then and she took our Golden Retriever or not the Golden Retriever the Norwegian Elk Hound over there and	3707	B
it it it's a pretty good class and they did pretty good except this dog is she's just pretty she's not smart so she didn't learn a lot but it i think it calmed her down a little bit and she's used to being around other dogs now	3707	B
i think it was like a six week program	3707	B
uh i think it was one night a week for like six weeks and uh you know it was a group class outside	3707	B
it was fairly reasonable too	3707	B
yeah they're pretty- they're usually a high strung dog aren't they	3707	B
um our our friend has a	3707	B
uh we have a Sheltie Collie a miniature Sheltie	3707	A
yeah it's about oh about_1 six months old	3707	A
and we're trying- we're we- we live in an apartment so we don't have a yard so it has to stay- stay- stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it	3707	A
it's about six months	3707	A
really	3707	A
but they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs but i guess every one one every one one of them_1 or or every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because_1 this one isn't	3707	A
um-hum	3707	A
yeah	3707	A
so how'd y'all how do you what's the best method	3707	A
right	3707	A
stand outside with them_1 until they	3707	A
well we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult and	3707	A
you know you don't wanna you don't wanna spank it or scare it or anything like that so	3707	A
yeah we we try to take it	3707	A
you know it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside and you know and then it runs right inside and it does it huh	3707	A
yeah a lot of times and you know it it won't it's whole job outside and it comes inside	3707	A
uh yeah we've tried that and uh	3707	A
you know there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go so and he chews on plants and all that but you know that's natural for a little puppy huh	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
oh that's sad	3707	A
huh	3707	A
how old is it	3707	A
man that's sad	3707	A
oh of course not	3707	A
i couldn't	3707	A
that is really sad what what's the deal we- we try to we're trying to take it on walks now you know	3707	A
and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash	3707	A
and so it i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it i mean it just goes like a mad dog i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and	3707	A
it's you know i mean it's not even close to even being trained on a leash	3707	A
um-hum well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they	3707	A
sometimes misuse- misuse their	3707	A
license or whatever you know and they treat them_1 bad	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
uh-huh	3707	A
how long did it take	3707	A
every what	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
well Sheltie Collies are you know timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and	3707	A
yeah yeah and uh if they're not accustomed to something they they're really scared so	3707	A
family with children or	3741	A
oh do you	3741	A
so what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them	3741	A
that's true and then you just get to spoil the grandkids and send them home right that's what my mom always says	3741	A
yeah i have one little daughter she's just a year and a half	3741	A
and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like	3741	A
she's not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing her attention span's only a couple of minutes i think and then its on to the new little mess	3741	A
i'm sure you remember those days	3741	A
but and we try and sit and read to her she's really good she'll bring us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff but	3741	A
i can't they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else	3741	A
or else she loses her loses a attention- the attention's not that interesting to her for very long	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
uh	3741	A
uh	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
oh yeah	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
uh-huh and it	3741	A
yeah i- i uh my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and	3741	A
i i've carried it through i love to read now and and uh that's why we've we've made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we don't you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that	3741	A
that uh it's something good to do but	3741	A
yeah it's it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and it's the same one over and over and over again it seems like but	3741	A
but i guess like you say she it's something so she at least she gets in the habit	3741	A
but	3741	A
yeah we uh my wife works at a day care part time and she's able to take her with her there but she she works with a lot of kids whose parents you know it's they drop them_1 off at six in the morning and then pick them_1 up at six at night and	3741	A
then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder	3741	A
you know there's	3741	A
there's a lot to be said with- with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids that's for sure	3741	A
other than just you know putting them in front of the TV or something like that	3741	A
i have a kind of a hard time with that but	3741	A
it's uh i think it's fair to say you get more of a there's a lot more love and they don't have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the parents are spending time doing stuff with them	3741	A
so	3741	A
how many children did you have- do you have	3741	A
three and how many grandchildren	3741	A
eight oh that's good	3741	A
yeah we uh my mom and dad just well they have three grandchildren now each of my brother and sister each we each have one but	3741	A
they're they're fond of like i say they like to keep them_1 for a couple of hours but boy when they send them home with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death	3741	A
they like them_1 but	3741	A
uh they they're looking forward they like i say they've been looking forward to the time when they could just send them_1 home with their with their parents as opposed to having to keep us all the time	3741	A
so	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
yeah well how do you do	3741	A
how did you do that i mean you know as far as having to tell them_1 no or slapping their hands or something like that that's that's what we struggle with	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah well that's the important thing and they probably appreciate all you did for them_1 so	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
we're just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my mom is just you wait you know you'll get all that you ever gave so i could be in trouble but	3741	A
i say they they're a handful that's for sure we i just last night uh she	3741	A
uh yes in fact i'm i'm i've got grandchildren	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
uh spending uh	3741	B
oh just visiting back and forth fortunately when your children get up in their thirties	3741	B
they finally grow up you get to enjoy them	3741	B
right right right	3741	B
yeah do you have children	3741	B
oh	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
oh yeah	3741	B
oh yeah yeah	3741	B
um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah i- i think one of the very most important	3741	B
was i- i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to read to them	3741	B
uh and get them to love books	3741	B
before they ever start to preschool	3741	B
uh	3741	B
i was very fortunate in having an older sister who read to me constantly and uh so i was i went to school in the days before public kindergarten	3741	B
but uh uh i had practically all the fairy stories read to me before i started to school so	3741	B
uh i uh i made great strides and i i'm sure you'll experience the same thing	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
oh yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah yeah	3741	B
um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
i have three three yeah	3741	B
uh eight	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah yeah yeah	3741	B
i i think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause some days when you're feeling pretty good you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder then on days when you don't feel well	3741	B
what do you mean you didn't do this	3741	B
oh oh gee i- i- i- i did a lot of the wrong things i'm sure	3741	B
but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if	3741	B
i i tried to keep as few rules but well really about the only rule i had was they couldn't play on the top bunk and they had to confine their eating to the kitchen	3741	B
so	3741	B
yeah yeah and uh so	3741	B
uh	3741	B
i don't know they all turned around- out okay so	3741	B
well i- i think so and um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um well i have i have two kids in school and	3757	B
and in comparing it with people who live in other parts of the world one of the things that- things wrong is that our our schools our kids seem to go to school less	3757	B
of- of the year than than kids in other countries	3757	B
um it seems like uh the long summer break is something that	3757	B
only	3757	B
uh only occurs in the United States	3757	B
um do you have any kids in school	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
well some of the- some of the uh schools are trying to go to more of a year around system	3757	B
and uh i guess there's pros and cons to that too i know if if if it happened here i would hope that uh you know i have uh two children that are two years a part i would just hope they were in the same system so	3757	B
if you wanna take a vacation you could	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
it could it could one of the other um things is that um	3757	B
uh there's been a lot of talk about uh American schools uh getting behind in science compared to uh lot of European schools and and Japan also	3757	B
that their schools are teaching uh more of the science sciences and putting out better	3757	B
uh graduates when in math and science uh for the future you know technology in various countries	3757	B
and that's not a favorite subject for either of my my kids it's probably not	3757	B
for anyone but it just seems like uh those are the criticisms criticisms you hear over and over about the the the American public school system and this is probably why a lot people go to private schools instead	3757	B
some of the some of the people that i work with uh they're they're some from various parts of the of the world and and uh course everybody likes to think their system's the best but the the ones in	3757	B
England and and then Germany seem seem to uh have some logical points about	3757	B
you know why do why do kids need a three month break in the summer	3757	B
and i i think that dates back to	3757	B
when America was agricultural and nature and and children needed to help on farms and it's been quite a while since that's been the case for most part now	3757	B
and it seems though that's one of the things that ought to to change	3757	B
uh i'm not i'm not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and	3757	B
and uh Christmas time for the other you know the other one	3757	B
and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with uh families going on vacation	3757	B
tends to make some crowds	3757	B
did you go through the public school system	3757	B
uh uh uh yeah i did too and everyone else in my family but seems like uh	3757	B
uh if people can afford it the number of people go the private school route but that's of course not available to to the average person with	3757	B
yes uh-huh	3757	B
that i have mixed feelings about that too i guess whether or not they miss the social interaction a part of it	3757	B
yeah that that would help	3757	B
yeah uh-huh	3757	B
yeah the i i think that's why a lot of people go to the home schooling they they disagree with what they're exposed to either for religious reasons or or other reasons	3757	B
um	3757	B
the other thing that's happening now i guess is is	3757	B
well Tom what do you think about our public school systems today	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
no i don't	3757	A
so i'm a little bit out of it i can look back to my to when i was in school which is getting further and further away and also i have a niece and nephew that are in school out in California and i hear a little a bit about from my sister about	3757	A
things going on yeah	3757	A
yeah they're moving to that out there	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
uh-huh i hear that they that in at least in the system that's going out um in California where that i'm familiar with that they do put families on the same schedule	3757	A
so seems like that could get a little difficult to do that but	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah yeah	3757	A
yeah well i hadn't thought about those things but those are problems um	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
right	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah there's no need for it anymore	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
right yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah i did	3757	A
right i know a lot of people that are home schooling their children you know just teaching them at home and	3757	A
and for lots of different reasons you know	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
i know that a lot of them um they hook up with like a home schooling system and they get together the kids get together for lots of activities and outings and stuff like that	3757	A
yeah i think that helps yeah i wonder too i have mixed feelings about it but um	3757	A
i know that uh you know i spot when i thought of problems in the school system it's not really the fault of the school system but there's a lot of	3757	A
you know it's just uh	3757	A
i don't know kids are exposed to a lot that you can't shelter them eventually- eventually but it's hard at a young age some of the pressures and	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
it was Lee right yeah Lee what-	3765	B
i'm Bob	3765	B
you know the Arabs world doesn't do a lot of the things i like but they don't have too many repeat offenders- offenders in drugs and murder and a few other things	3765	B
you steal they cut off the hand you steal again they cut off both hands it takes care of it quick	3765	B
it takes care of it quick	3765	B
uh two wrongs don't make a right	3765	B
yeah	3765	B
yeah in Texas uh some private enterprise built a few prisons or jails	3765	B
and with- with the hope that the over flow from the county or the state would kind of get to them_1	3765	B
but uh see the evidently the counties and the cities are too scared to use them_1 because_1 of the expense but uh they're having trouble now paying their bills because_1 they're not getting any customers	3765	B
i don't understand that	3765	B
years ago i sat on a rape trial and we let the guy off wasn't enough evidence although i'm sure he did it	3765	B
um-hum	3765	B
i think you need to get tough with them_1 and quit calling them_1 i don't think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor manual-	3765	B
and as tough as you can make it no coddling no kissing their and nothing- nothing just say hey you committed a wrong and you're going to serve some hard hard time	3765	B
and uh	3765	B
there in San Francisco you have a interesting place called the Delancy Street House have you heard of it	3765	B
hum	3765	B
we was talking to somebody the other day over there in Japan uh	3765	B
they have a very low crime problem	3765	B
and one of the things they do to them_1 in Japan is they publish the name and address	3765	B
and families of the person convicted of a crime and there is such embarrassment to the family that they have to move out of the neighborhood and move to another part of the country	3765	B
well- well our family sense of family has eroded i'm afraid in this country but	3765	B
i don't think it'll work here but over there the the way they're doing it it seems to be effective	3765	B
i've heard that i've heard that no i haven't	3765	B
uh	3765	B
terribly expensive yeah	3765	B
it's Lee	3765	A
uh and you're Bob	3765	A
uh	3765	A
i've been uh	3765	A
thinking about the topic and i think it's uh	3765	A
going to be interesting to see what happens as the criminal justice system	3765	A
responds to the tremendous	3765	A
i guess over load in	3765	A
uh cases they say that these drug cases	3765	A
alone are swamping the criminal justice system	3765	A
i've	3765	A
i've heard that i've heard that uh	3765	A
yeah i've even heard that the other end of the continuum some judges who are arguing that uh because the system is so over loaded that	3765	A
uh they recommend decriminalizing some of these things because the courts can't possibly handle all the cases	3765	A
i think its going to be very interesting because its uh	3765	A
it's really become a major expense for us as a society	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
well you know the other-	3765	A
the other thing that i think is interesting about this is that they've been experimenting for years in the civil justice system with alternatives to courts where you can rent a judge and i'm wondering whether we'll eventually go to renting a jury	3765	A
um and finding ways uh like The People's Court to try some of these cases	3765	A
i think uh the expense is is enormous have you ever sat on a jury	3765	A
yeah well it's uh	3765	A
it's it's a major undertaking i mean people have to give up their work and and a lot of their time	3765	A
and uh i- i just think it can overwhelm us pretty easily uh when i hear what people are saying about just the sheer volume of the cases	3765	A
well there are a lot of people who think that that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh	3765	A
it's push come to shove time as far as i can tell in terms of the sheer volume of this stuff	3765	A
yeah oh yeah it's well known and and it's consistent with what you're talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess	3765	A
you know we're going to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system	3765	A
um	3765	A
it's gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh	3765	A
the topic is an interesting one because of the um	3765	A
uh the price you pay for freedom i guess	3765	A
you know the the requirement that that people be given a trial and and	3765	A
and then then the issue becomes what do you do once somebody's found guilty i suppose	3765	A
yeah-	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
yeah have you uh in Dallas uh seen the newspapers ever print the names of people who were uh uh uh picked up as johns uh in under cover operations	3765	A
they they they've done that in San Francisco and uh you know it's gonna be interesting to see how all these things change as as we look at the cost of it because	3765	A
um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybody's entitled to a lawyer but not everybody's entitled to a doctor and we must spend	3765	A
i don't know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we're talking about are going to contribute to change and i don't know uh	3765	A
okay what do you think	3719	A
right um-hum	3719	A
yeah the class sizes are too large and they don't pay the teachers enough	3719	A
like in Dallas they have too many administrators they're top-heavy	3719	A
and uh they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the	3719	A
the text	3719	A
having um mistakes in them_1	3719	A
and uh a lot of them_1 aren't like the history books aren't historically correct they they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened	3719	A
well i think they need to	3719	A
do whatever they can like um i think	3719	A
um Massachusetts put a priority on education and and um	3719	A
bringing in industry and recruiting	3719	A
and they made a lot of difference in that state and in Texas i think we're like twenty ninth in spending	3719	A
you know and they put through this Robin Hood bill but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly	3719	A
and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to um make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because_1 most of the time the teachers spend	3719	A
disciplining the the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now	3719	A
so	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
yeah	3719	A
and uh i i think they changed the way the ladder is now that it takes a longer time for- for you to qualify for a higher salary and uh it's it's um	3719	A
it's more subjective than it was before	3719	A
so	3719	A
i don't know you know i don't know what incentive teacher has to stay in teaching	3719	A
i just have uh one daughter she's six now she's going to Richardson Public Schools	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
right	3719	A
right but the worst school districts are Dallas Garland Carrollton	3719	A
um Coppell really doesn't matter much it's it's is not at the bottom and the best is uh Highland Park Richardson and Plano	3719	A
she's six	3719	A
yeah	3719	A
and you know and she's learning to read so and she can do a little bit of math now so	3719	A
oh uh Valley View Mall	3719	A
oh yeah there's supposed to all- all the calls are supposed to be from a different phone so	3719	A
that's where i am and they have a lot of pay phones here so	3719	A
you know	3719	A
and i and i don't know uh uh they cut back on the since Mark White passed that bill about	3719	A
cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit	3719	A
because um	3719	A
i was talking to a lady the other day and that that's the first thing she said her her both her children were in band and they'd quit	3719	A
and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend- spend all of his time on band	3719	A
right and he he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the Lewisville School District	3719	A
and uh you know it's just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that	3719	A
everything should be equal you know and there's no reason you already spend all that time in band there's no reason that he should practice more than an hour a day outside of band if he if he even has the energy especially in marching season	3719	A
you know	3719	A
right and and what do you do when you are taking calculus and uh chemistry and physics two and	3719	A
something wrong with our school systems yes	3719	B
nobody wants to go to public schools um	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
just- what do you think can be done about that	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i agree	3719	B
i've got a friend who's uh a very talented teacher and has given it up	3719	B
uh in Carrollton uh just because_1 it's not i mean she just can't stand the paper work um	3719	B
you know it's uh	3719	B
and she's not paid enough she gets more as a filing claims for an insurance company which she's not even trained to do	3719	B
so	3719	B
i think it's real discouraging	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i don't either	3719	B
well do you have children	3719	B
out of the Dallas School District	3719	B
basically	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i don't have any but if i did i don't know that i could i would want them to be in a Dallas School District	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
how old is your daughter	3719	B
so she's just started this year	3719	B
where are you speaking from i can hear a lot of background noise	3719	B
oh	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
wow that is funny	3719	B
well	3719	B
um-hum	3719	B
um-hum	3719	B
and demanded the children right	3719	B
uh-huh	3719	B
hm	3719	B
well that goes along with football though too you know uh	3719	B
all righty	3732	A
so how- what do you think of capital punishment	3732	A
oh does it	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
well i feel that way the only exception i think is qualifies for capital punishment is repeat offenders where the offender actually murders people repeatedly	3732	A
like serial killers or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge and then gotten out on parole i don't think they should be able to get out on parole and do it again	3732	A
that's the only time i think it's really	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
yeah exactly	3732	A
and i think i think those types of people deserve capital punishment	3732	A
but i think they should restrict it strictly for repeat offenders or like i said serial killers because i mean a lot of times- not a lot of times but quite- quite a few times they've convicted innocent people on the first time	3732	A
but you know if they've been convicted like three times you know there something's wrong	3732	A
so i think that's the only time it's really a necessary	3732	A
uh	3732	A
the guilty party	3732	A
right	3732	A
but that's really the only time when i agree with it	3732	A
most of the time i don't think it's a good idea because_1 like you said there have been cases where they've convicted the wrong people	3732	A
just because of circumstances	3732	A
but in Arizona which is where i'm originally from	3732	A
they had a big thing about capital punishment there because we had like two serial killers within six months caught	3732	A
and they had a big thing about whether they should you know go for capital punishment or not but it's not used in Arizona	3732	A
so they had a problem with it	3732	A
unfortunately all the people got was sent to jail for a couple of years until they get paroled	3732	A
unfortunately one of them_1 killed a friend of mine so i was very much involved	3732	A
and when he got out on parole i was like	3732	A
go ahead get out on parole	3732	A
and	3732	A
after that i had i had to tangle with him and the police caught him the second time and they still wouldn't do anything except send him to jail so	3732	A
i definitely believe if they're repeat offenders they should	3732	A
be	3732	A
something to be done with them_1 other than just sitting there for two years and then getting out and doing it again	3732	A
but a lot of states have outlawed capital punishment	3732	A
i don't know which states in general	3732	A
oh really	3732	A
hum	3732	A
huh i didn't know that	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
really	3732	A
hum i didn't know that	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
but	3732	A
i don't know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays it's like i think people have to be off the wall to do them_1 but	3732	A
i still don't believe capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders	3732	A
but	3732	A
i don't know i	3732	A
once i finish law school i'll have	3732	A
more probably more views on it	3732	A
i'll be able to do something about it then	3732	A
oh do they	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
that would be the more humane way of doing it	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
or stuck in a gas chamber until they finally pass on	3732	A
but i know a couple of states	3732	A
still believe in the hanging but	3732	A
i don't i don't go for that either	3732	A
well Texas has capital punishment	3732	B
yep and uh	3732	B
they go through a set of appeals that lasts seven years	3732	B
and uh	3732	B
there are so many cases here like Sixty Minutes is on right now here there are so many cases here where they proved that they've convicted the wrong person	3732	B
that i'm against it they should just give them_1 life in prison	3732	B
right	3732	B
yeah exactly	3732	B
right uh-huh	3732	B
well like in your state Charles Manson	3732	B
or the guy who killed all those children	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
right	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
something's going on right	3732	B
yeah i think so too after after it's gone that far then they pretty well have a	3732	B
enough proof that that person's	3732	B
they can't be rehabilitated- rehabilitated either so yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
right i never heard about those	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
right	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
and that's that's the reason that Ted Bundy supposedly went to Florida	3732	B
that was his primary goal was to to have the death penalty	3732	B
because he started out in Washington and Oregon and traveled all the way across the country	3732	B
they had um	3732	B
Mark Harmon played him they had a movie about it a few years ago	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
and then of course there was a lot of publicity about it um the days before they killed him	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
so	3732	B
and he was really you know he was off the wall so	3732	B
right	3732	B
and-	3732	B
yeah and some of the ways i think that um the way that Texas um executes the prisoners is probably the most humane way they use- they do it by injection	3732	B
yeah instead of you know the electric chair the gas chamber that's	3732	B
you know	3732	B
yeah well they you know they just go to sleep and and then eventually they die	3732	B
instead of being you know fried or	3732	B
or	3732	B
yeah fighting fighting for breath right um-hum	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
okay you ready to discuss the the topic	3738	A
okay the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago	3738	A
are you ready for that okay pardon me	3738	A
okay well uh there's uh it's kind of an interesting- interesting topic and one that i think is quite fascinating because	3738	A
uh couple of years ago i guess uh not very not many- not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the United States but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was	3738	A
basically in a	3738	A
you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing	3738	A
you know you had the the Russians against the Americans the Communists against the Free World	3738	A
and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where	3738	A
uh couple of years ago we had uh America uh was a one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned and now we're	3738	A
having a very tough time in a recessionary period we're also have a very humongous trade deficit and uh	3738	A
and that's kind of frightening also you know a couple of years ago ten fifteen- fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life	3738	A
and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every you know every couple years and possibly five- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime	3738	A
and so i think uh	3738	A
you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and a lot- and uh	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
true	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yes yes	3738	A
true true	3738	A
um-hum well do you do you think that's good or bad	3738	A
you think that's great	3738	A
that something- yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn	3738	A
and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and	3738	A
when that's over with that's that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular	3738	A
um education and and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to to expand ourselves also	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yes i agree with that i agree with that so i i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn	3738	A
learn how to adapt learn how to grow in the in their college or whatever education they might take so that that's good that's good	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yeah i i- i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress uh for those people that are laid off and also for those people	3738	A
that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place	3738	A
and it affects-	3738	A
what's the topic	3738	B
okay	3738	B
you bet i'll let you lead out	3738	B
i'll let you lead out	3738	B
i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also	3738	B
so if you look at Russia and what's happened over there i think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing	3738	B
i think was i look at the economic problems in the United States right now one of the things you wonder is what's that going to do to us	3738	B
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i mean i think it's great that you can have three or four different careers in your life i think it must've been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years	3738	B
so i think that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing	3738	B
and the uncertainty of whether you're gonna have a job is not as good but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs	3738	B
i think it's great	3738	B
oh yeah	3738	B
i think one of the problems with with education in as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education- education is prepared to help people make those changes	3738	B
it still seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession	3738	B
and not giving them_1 the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think's gonna be a hard thing for for people to face	3738	B
yeah	3738	B
there probably needs to be some training on how to to to to adjust to these changes as they come about	3738	B
i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them_1 even ideas of how to make those changes now	3738	B
so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them	3738	B
um-hum	3738	B
no i don't no	3785	B
not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
and do you have any children	3785	B
uh-huh	3785	B
yeah	3785	B
yeah yeah	3785	B
i think it's probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than it's realistic that that the school system can provide	3785	B
and in conjunction a lot of um school districts' funds have been cut because of at least in California that's the case it's probably the case elsewhere too	3785	B
i don't even know if it's just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it it's a matter of	3785	B
well it's kind of a philosophical- philosophical expectation about who's responsible for discipline you know it's	3785	B
it	3785	B
you know you- you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and	3785	B
in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for what's important in terms of values and i think that's probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess	3785	B
i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
maybe TV's a bigger um	3785	B
competitor for their time	3785	B
and when we were kids	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
yeah	3785	B
that's a good point just learning the discipline to to to study	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to speak- speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home	3785	B
our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are	3785	B
well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um	3785	B
i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco	3785	B
in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um	3785	B
i have to really do the research to find out	3785	B
whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that	3785	B
it's really the the expense is a real issue when you think about	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
well i don't know how it is in your community i know that um	3785	B
in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually it's not so much in the city actually it's outside more in the east- Oakland or east bay	3785	B
um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that they're getting getting what they want in the public schools so they're almost like public-	3785	B
school teacher or do you have anything to do with anything in schools or	3785	A
no huh	3785	A
no uh not a lot i've got a couple of friends that work uh as teachers or you know in in different school districts and different things but uh	3785	A
i	3785	A
i have a daughter that's only eighteen months though so we haven't got exposed too much to that but	3785	A
you can sure see where it seems like uh	3785	A
there's a lot of concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education i- i kind of wonder i don't know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or exactly what	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
for them to get	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
sure	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
well they've been cut yeah i just it seems like more and more with uh more families having to resort to you know to two incomes and stuff there's not the time that they spend and so they like you say they expect the the schools to do more of it but hell there's only so many in hours a day	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
oh you know i think that's a good point it's really a good point	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
yeah i uh you know it seems like i remember on school nights you know i was never outside past eight you know maybe nine o'clock at the very latest	3785	A
whether i was in doing homework or not you know i may not have been but yet there was that influence in the home to where i was at least you know getting prepared for the next day or whatever and and you're you know you're right in saying you don't see a lot of that there's out running around and uh doing a lot of different things that	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
TV and Nintendo	3785	A
yeah that's probably true there's a lot more uh	3785	A
yeah that's true i know you know i didn't appreciate i	3785	A
i was you know fortunate to where i could i kind of breezed through high school without too much problem stuff and and didn't really learn how to study that much until i hit college	3785	A
but boy i sure wish now that i had picked that up earlier because_1 you know took me a couple of years in college before i really started getting the grades going and	3785	A
you know it affects your whole life especially when you hit college if you don't you know do as well as you can it can it can follow you for quite a while so	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
to sit and study and i don't know it's it's you know i only have the the one daughter and she's quite young but it makes you a little nervous to	3785	A
know what they have to deal with you know in the future and get prepared for them_1 but	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
do you have any children at all or	3785	A
oh yeah	3785	A
same boat	3785	A
yeah have you uh have you ever considered private schools at all or	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
yeah that's true that's true yeah i- i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh	3785	A
sometimes i wonder if they can get that same thing in a in a private high- school or	3785	A
or not	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
do you have gang problems	3772	B
well i'm a school principal	3772	B
um-hum elementary school	3772	B
well its elementary school	3772	B
elementary but i have gang problems	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
i'm in a part of Dallas where there's a lot of gang activity and my i have through the sixth grade	3772	B
but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old	3772	B
and they get recruited	3772	B
so uh	3772	B
we we have really very significant problems	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
yeah	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
its its surprising to me that it's that true there because the only time i've ever been to Utah	3772	B
i spent a week on the Brigham Young campus at a workshop	3772	B
and it was very uh	3772	B
dramatically different that the people you saw than what we see here because you had no minorities you know and	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
but of course you you have a lot of parents that are not really parenting much	3772	B
you have that in Utah	3772	B
you have that in Utah	3772	B
because i would think that big Mormon influence there would uh	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
well i- i work in an an area of town like my school	3772	B
is about seventy five percent Anglo and that's very unusual in the in the Dallas Public Schools	3772	B
but it's very it's like the lowest socioeconomic Anglos	3772	B
yeah it's it's what in the South we call poor white trash	3772	B
and then the other uh significant percentage i have is Hispanic	3772	B
and course that's growing	3772	B
but the kids that i have	3772	B
the biggest discipline problems with are Anglo children	3772	B
and i i've got lots of Anglo children who are just	3772	B
not really wanted by anybody	3772	B
well and for example i have a boy now he checked out today	3772	B
he's fourteen he's in the sixth grade he lived with his mother in Mississippi he had been to he thought ten or twelve schools in Mississippi	3772	B
then his mother now his mother and father aren't divorced but they don't live together in a long time his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child support for his children	3772	B
that they couldn't afford to keep her children anymore so they sent them_1 here	3772	B
and here he was with his father and his father's pregnant girlfriend	3772	B
and they pawned all his personal belongings like he had a Nintendo and a VCR and some stuff they pawned that	3772	B
and he's just been tearing my school up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to Mississippi	3772	B
and today they checked him out to send him back to Mississippi	3772	B
now those kids	3772	B
yeah but	3772	B
yeah but those kids are	3772	B
ready fodder for gangs	3772	B
sure they belong gives them_1 something to belong to gives them_1 identity gives them_1 importance	3772	B
gives them_1 a certain security	3772	B
and um	3772	B
so i guess most of what happens happens in Salt Lake which is just about twenty miles south of us and that's quite a bit bigger and	3772	A
they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like LA a little bit but	3772	A
yeah it's there they- they say its getting a lot bigger uh	3772	A
oh are you so you're right familiar with all that i bet	3772	A
oh it's a what	3772	A
oh yeah	3772	A
oh at- that young huh you're kidding at which-	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah so they're getting started	3772	A
oh you're kidding	3772	A
i'll bet	3772	A
my wife was just uh talking to her mother and uh i guess they said they had an F B I come- guy come to there she she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know gang and stuff like that and	3772	A
and uh that you know it some day it'll eventually past but right now they say there's all kinds of kids getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street and that's get it's getting pretty darn scary i've got a little eighteen	3772	A
it	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
yeah that's true	3772	A
yeah i think we've probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldn't say we're anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but	3772	A
it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the the gang related things they put them_1 in jail and then they they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around L A or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but	3772	A
you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at ten eleven o'clock just roaming the streets and	3772	A
i just never remember that when you know it's been a while since i was in junior high or high school- or even elementary school but	3772	A
you just- i just you were never out past eight or nine o'clock on a school night you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and	3772	A
yeah that's true and you know and i think when it come	3772	A
pardon	3772	A
yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i	3772	A
yeah with with that with that Mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the two parent income or the two income families and and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the the values taught in the home that you used to get	3772	A
and and the kids are left to to to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i I really think that's what you're missing- we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught years ago to	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yo yeah	3772	A
i would think so yeah	3772	A
oh really	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
oh really	3772	A
huh not by their families or anything	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
sheesh	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
oh jeez	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
jeez	3772	A
huh	3772	A
you're kidding you know and that and it's so sad because_1 you i mean sure it's the kids doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah	3772	A
oh yeah	3772	A
the people show them_1 some interest show them_1 some love and	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
okay now what is your favorite TV show	3766	A
well can't you find anything else to um to replace	3766	A
so you don't watch Northern Exposure	3766	A
oh okay you're having to be in reruns for that one have you seen Brooklyn Bridge	3766	A
that is one of it's so clean and so laid back and i'm awful tired of	3766	A
some of the things that they have on TV but this thirty minute story is i would certainly recommend that you try it	3766	A
it-	3766	A
oh okay	3766	A
well	3766	A
and i think it's a shame that our life has to be i mean so many of the tragedies that we have on the movies or on TV no we need something lighter than that have you seen um	3766	A
hm i'll Fly Away	3766	A
yes yeah	3766	A
well	3766	A
um it's not	3766	A
i don't know it it's clean it there again you don't have the violence	3766	A
and um i'm surprised it's even still on because coming at seven o'clock in the evening that's when the children want to watch	3766	A
and that is not part of it	3766	A
so um	3766	A
oh	3766	A
well i'm let's see i believe Texas lost last night is that correct	3766	A
well you don't have to	3766	A
well don't you ever forget that Oklahoma is not bad but Oklahoma	3766	A
Oklahoma State though is the better of the two so	3766	A
that's right um-hum i'm a transplanted Texan- Okie um-hum	3766	A
well we've from somewhere is correct so i hope you can find enough TV to keep you happy this winter	3766	A
well i have recently retired and i find that this is the most boring thing in the world is to sit and watch TV	3766	A
oh you don't well	3766	A
well	3766	A
it's	3766	A
oh it's nice to have the noise sometime it's nice that you don't need that noise	3766	A
do you work out of the home	3766	A
oh	3766	A
okay	3766	A
i was an accountant at the medical school here for the food service	3766	A
and it was a very heavy desk and a very busy desk and i'm awful sorry that i'm no longer gainfully employed but they're	3766	A
well it was Newhart and it's gone now and i miss it real bad	3766	B
uh yeah i think so i like the new Home Improvement sitcom i like any- i like most of the sitcoms if they keep me entertained for a half an hour	3766	B
i do watch Northern Exposure and also for for ever how many years it's been on TV i've been watching Knots Landing	3766	B
no i haven't seen that one yet	3766	B
uh	3766	B
i don't know my wife- i don't know but you know my wife watches all those Rescue 911 Unsolved Mystery things	3766	B
drives me nuts	3766	B
i just don't even like to be in the room when all of those are on it's like too much real life	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
i'll Fly Away i think i watched that that's where there there's a lawyer and he has a black nurse or a nanny	3766	B
i watched that once when it- i think when it the first episode and it just didn't grab my attention	3766	B
i felt like it was kind of they were trying to copy To Kill a Mockingbird without all the suspense or something	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
right	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
actually it's	3766	B
the best time of the year for me for watching TV is is starts around Christmas and will end in April and that's for the college basketball	3766	B
um really get involved in that my wife played basketball when she was in high school and college so that's something we can both watch and keep up with which is pretty interesting at time	3766	B
you know i'm not sure if Texas won or lost i can't i don't even keep up with them or either my uh son goes there i just don't keep up with them_1	3766	B
no my favorite teams are back east and they seem to be the best ones anyway so	3766	B
it's	3766	B
yeah well Oklahoma's doing good this year it	3766	B
yeah that where you are from Oklahoma yeah	3766	B
well aren't we all are from somewhere	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
well there's always actually i'll probably watch too much TV and and	3766	B
uh i think that probably effects me too from- just from watching too much	3766	B
so yeah well i'm at home all the time myself and uh i don't work	3766	B
and i never ever turn the TV on during the day	3766	B
uh just just something i i can't do i won't do and when someone else is here during the day and and like my son's been out of school for a month drives me nuts when he turns that thing on during the day	3766	B
well	3766	B
uh no- i have a medical problem and i don't haven't worked for three years so	3766	B
so that that just i just stay home and	3766	B
run errands do chores keep you know do the house work for my wife she still works and uh that sort of thing	3766	B
what kind of a job did you have when you were working	3766	B
yeah well	3766	B
Kathy you you know i'm i was thinking about basketball teams and um the funny thing is when i was in college at BYU i followed the school team and um	3718	A
and then when i graduated and we got married and everything i really kind of lost interest in following teams have you been following any	3718	A
oh no i know they're always having um i mean i can't believe the amount of money that the players make in the first place and i mean i know that they have a short um career and everything	3718	A
that's true it's really a lot but uh my sister always gets um season tickets to the Utah Jazz and um	3718	A
so she watches their games a lot and and everything but i don't believe we've ever been involved with any team that you know makes it to the play-offs	3718	A
too much	3718	A
uh-huh	3718	A
you did	3718	A
well i was at uh BYU when they made it to the play-offs and i think they played Notre Dame or something	3718	A
um for the big game i can't remember now that was so seems like it was eons ago it was like ten years ago i think and um i remember-	3718	A
um isn't that the one that was like the star player was Danny Ainge i think he started playing for the Boston- Boston Celtics after that	3718	A
and um and um and there was another the center	3718	A
it's been so long i can't think of anyone's name but um i i was there that year and enjoyed that game and uh but mostly like i say i haven't been following the teams and don't know who's got what record	3718	A
i haven't played uh since i broke my knee cap but um i did play in high school i was on our high school girls' team	3718	A
well i lived in Missouri and i went and i played for Parkview High School in Missouri- in Springfield Missouri and i played um a forward	3718	A
and um i enjoyed that then and that's i always loved sports do you play for your ward	3718	A
the problem that is a problem	3718	A
uh-huh	3718	A
no well i was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as opposed to professional because_1 i'd rather play than watch any thing	3718	A
and um so i'm you know like i	3718	A
well i um i have one i don't like his name- his last name was Sampson do you -remember him and he because_1 he came to Houston when i lived there and um to play for the Houston team and he was really	3718	A
i thought a bad sport and uh and i haven't followed like i say	3718	A
um-hum um-hum	3718	A
yeah that's really true but um	3718	A
well and i also don't want to spend so much of my time um memorizing statistics	3718	A
um-hum	3718	A
that's true and and you know i get i have interest in the games but i'm satisfied to watch a score in the newspaper or on you know the sports news report or something	3718	A
right rather than just like you say watch clips from the game	3718	A
no i my both my children are little they're just in kindergarten and first grade	3718	A
so no they don't play and um	3718	A
and my husband loves baseball which i don't really prefer but	3718	A
so we haven't uh haven't don't been into basketball too much but anyway	3718	A
now i can remember even what they were called um	3718	A
no i don't think so no it was the Astros the Astros were the baseball team and the Oilers Rockets yes that's it the Rockets	3718	A
yeah i uh you know we saw a game	3718	A
hi	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
not too much um who is it from the Mavericks that just wasn't there some controversy about one of their players that didn't get to play so now he doesn't he didn't get to play the whole game so now he doesn't want to play at all or something	3718	B
its crazy	3718	B
right but even so i mean i don't think i will make a million in or three million in a life time let alone a season	3718	B
yep	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah yeah we came from Oakland i went to BYU also	3718	B
yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really haven't done much with the Mavericks here	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
did you know let me think who was on that team there was a Dave Callus or a Gordon Breun remember those names	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
Celtics right right	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
right so do you play for your ward team	3718	B
oh oh	3718	B
uh-huh where did you go to high school	3718	B
oh	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
um i kind of stopped playing for my ward because_1 i didn't like the sportsmanship with the stake	3718	B
so i play for a Richardson City league now	3718	B
but as far as knowing anything about professional teams you know when they said to put	3718	B
right right	3718	B
right	3718	B
do you have any players that you like watching	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
it really only takes one player to really give any team a bad rap you know one that	3718	B
publicity bound you know that	3718	B
right	3718	B
yeah that's right	3718	B
you know once it gets into the finals then i i kind of root for one or the other but up until then you know	3718	B
yeah the highlights	3718	B
do you have kids that play	3718	B
yeah yeah	3718	B
oh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
oh did you stay with now what team is it from Houston	3718	B
i wanna say Spurs but is that right	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
Rockets	3718	B
yeah	3718	B

um-hum um-hum well my i have also have a four bedroom house	3775	A
uh we have three bathrooms two upstairs and one downstairs	3775	A
which makes it nice because um it's right off the garage so when Gene's working on his cars he can come in and take a shower without going through the rest of the house	3775	A
and then um	3775	A
i have a it's in a small city of like um eight thousand people	3775	A
and i don't know if you've heard of Modesto that's the closest big city	3775	A
yeah yeah and it's on a cul-de-sac um	3775	A
which makes it nice because there's no through traffic you know about all the cars that come in here are people that just live right in here	3775	A
and uh	3775	A
yeah it makes a lot nicer space i say- i imagine you have little kids right	3775	A
oh okay well i have one also but he's he'll be thirty seven in uh February	3775	A
so but anyhow i have lots of little neighbor kids and they all love me and i just just worship them they can come in my house i have candy for them_1 and cookies for them_1	3775	A
you know so i'm just like their aunt Rosy	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
oh yeah it's	3775	A
but anyhow as far as decorating my house and everything too i've uh stenciled uh practically	3775	A
in every room in my house	3775	A
which um it looked like it would be very hard to do but it ended up being really easy and it just really just makes the rooms	3775	A
you know i stenciled right above the right below the ceiling line on the walls like- it looks something like a wallpaper border but it's actually is a stencil	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
uh-huh um-hum	3775	A
um-hum um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
well you can't afford to have it done you know plus it's fun i enjoy you know going out and working in the yard and	3775	A
you know just doing everything decorating the house up and changing it in fact i just bought a	3775	A
a large bird cage i had seen in magazines how they were decorating them that not that i want a bird i don't want a bird	3775	A
but i have decorated it up with flowers	3775	A
and i got a little nest in there that looks like it's got two little birds in there and i've got some dolls sitting in there	3775	A
it looks really really cute	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum um-hum	3775	A
yeah it's kind of fun to change too isn't it	3775	A
fudgesicle color no	3775	A
yeah it probably goes with a lot of different colors too	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
well you are the first man that i've talked to	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
yes	3775	B
okay_1	3775	B
well it's four bedroom two bath a brick ranch house uh on a kind of a quiet dead end street next to a big wide open field	3775	B
but we're two blocks from everything you need including a small mall	3775	B
and lots of businesses within walking distance but uh	3775	B
Austin's about a million people	3775	B
so it's it's it's it's it's a nice town it's real kind of a laid back place and uh kind of an environmentally conscious city	3775	B
i've heard of it i've never been there	3775	B
yeah i like that feature about where we live that was one of the reasons we bought this house is because_1 there's only six street six houses on the on the street so	3775	B
no no not at all i have uh one kid and he's twenty- almost twenty one	3775	B
uh we still have	3775	B
there are actually no kids right in the immediate neighborhood but uh we just moved here about two years ago and we still have kids from the old neighborhood which is only a few blocks they come to visit they expect brownies	3775	B
yeah they'll they'll stay till you bake a bunch but uh	3775	B
yeah	3775	B
right	3775	B
my wife and i've never tried any stenciling uh we've always thought we she wanted to anyway	3775	B
uh somehow i feel like this particular house doesn't call for stenciling we've done some wallpapering and	3775	B
uh my wife really likes to paint different colors and things so	3775	B
do all of our own uh decorating work and repair work around the house and yard work	3775	B
sometimes it's	3775	B
oh yeah	3775	B
yeah my wife just remodeled since Christmas she's remodeled our bedroom	3775	B
with all new sheets comforters things like that and paint and she did a wallpaper border	3775	B
new drapes uh looks it's just a whole different- different atmosphere in there looks kind of like i like to hang out in there now during the daytime	3775	B
it's just	3775	B
yeah she picked a for the walls she picked a fudgesicle color	3775	B
yeah	3775	B
which well i thought well i don't know if this'll work but when she finished	3775	B
it really looked good	3775	B
yeah i don't think she meant for it to go with anything other than just fudgesicle walls and the ends the white trim	3775	B
um just to give it a little bit different look than what it's always been or been lately anyway so	3775	B
really yeah	3775	B
um i would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this category	3740	A
oh you'll talk about anything right	3740	A
uh me too what kind of books do you read	3740	A
i see	3740	A
we're gonna get along well well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as Stephen King and such	3740	A
well thank goodness believe me	3740	A
have you read The Firm	3740	A
oh that was one of the best books i've read for a long time	3740	A
and um see another one i just read that i thought was really excellent was uh Jurassic Park	3740	A
Michael Crichton or something like that have you read that one	3740	A
no it's about um this multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start a theme park and it's about dinosaurs	3740	A
well they've taken DNA material from dinosaurs and and	3740	A
really recreated dinosaurs	3740	A
and well it's a little far fetched also but um it was really an excellent book it held my interest have you read any of his other things	3740	A
Terminal Man yeah i've seen seems like i've seen the movie	3740	A
i've read a couple of Robin Cook's	3740	A
um-hum	3740	A
well i noticed he had a couple i don't know how recent they are but i think Sphere was one and something else uh another one word title and i thought i might pick up one of those books because	3740	A
Sphere S P H E R E	3740	A
well how about did you read Silence of the Lambs	3740	A
yes i did	3740	A
they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was i- i could not put the book down i	3740	A
you're kidding	3740	A
oh yes	3740	A
i see	3740	A
the movie was wonderful you didn't see it	3740	A
well true it didn't have the impact but i thought that they stayed- uh they stayed very faithful to the book	3740	A
well	3740	A
it's hard to top that book	3740	A
oh really what's it about have you another serial killer	3740	A
oh	3740	A
Two Minute Warning	3740	A
you know i think you're right i think i	3740	A
i'll have to look back and see what else he's written because he	3740	A
really	3740	A
okay	3740	B
but i- i also picked gardening and i mean i tried to talk about that for five minutes i don't really garden very much but books i could talk about you know forever i	3740	B
well mostly fiction and um i- i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories	3740	B
see and um	3740	B
oh you too	3740	B
i	3740	B
yeah well i like uh i- i like a book i could	3740	B
in some way relate to and and that's i don't know it's so off the wall most of that stuff you know you really- i you can't really believe it- i mean you it's hard to to to read it and and really think that this could really happen it's it's i don't know it's not	3740	B
believable to me at all	3740	B
well well that's true i mean you don't have to read a book and believe that you know stuff can happen but i don't know i guess i just go more for realism	3740	B
oh yeah it's very good	3740	B
yeah	3740	B
yeah that was good i read that oh quite a while ago	3740	B
oh by um oh Crichton right Crichton now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing	3740	B
oh	3740	B
uh-huh	3740	B
yeah yeah	3740	B
yes i have but i Terminal Man was that- was that one of his	3740	B
he- he writes stuff his writing- books are similar to Robin Cook's have you read any Robin Cook	3740	B
yeah and they're sort of similar you know the in the you know he deals a lot in you know scientific stuff or you know stuff that um	3740	B
you don't know whether could it could happen or not you know it's just um	3740	B
you know but i mean most of it is good i uh haven't uh i haven't read anything by him in a long time	3740	B
Fear is that what you said Fear	3740	B
oh oh no i don't know i'm not familiar with that no	3740	B
oh oh yes oh yes- you- did you read his other one The Red Dragon yes now uh both of them were terrific	3740	B
well see now i couldn't either now i uh a friend of mine started to read it because_1 you know i told her it's terrific and everybody she'd spoke to said it was terrific she couldn't get into it	3740	B
well she's sort of a lightweight anyway you know her her uh her reading consists of uh have you ever heard of V C Andrews	3740	B
yeah you know stuff like that you know Danielle Steele you know you know stuff like that so she really she couldn't get into this but she i think she said she saw the movie she liked the movie i don't you know	3740	B
yeah the movie was good but i well you know compared to the book right no	3740	B
well they did but um i don't think it was as scary as i expected it to be i- i really you know	3740	B
i- i don't know i just didn't think it was as suspenseful as as	3740	B
i expected it to be i don't know but it was a good it was a good movie	3740	B
yeah well that's true and i'm waiting his new one comes out sometime in the spring i think	3740	B
yes	3740	B
uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well this- this'll be i think his fourth or fifth book	3740	B
and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black Sunday which was a about the uh bombing in the in the Superdome oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that	3740	B
um gee i don't know i think it was called Black Sunday it was about fifteen- well no about ten years ago i guess it uh you know	3740	B
but um	3740	B
that's all he's written Red Dragon that one and uh Silence of the	3740	B
um well i'm glad i got a male because i'm gonna need some help um i haven't really given any dinner parties but um	3715	A
so um maybe you could help me out here in this sense and i keep i keep asking him you know what what what do you think we ought to have you know but i was thinking of like you one of those subway sandwiches those long subway sandwiches and maybe uh	3715	A
um a pasta salad and some chips and some beer and some Coke and um i thought a cake and he said no and so we're just going back and forth so	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
yeah yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah he's i don't really think men care do they	3715	A
yeah that's what he said	3715	A
right	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah yeah so that oh okay i'll guess i'll do something like that but um	3715	A
oh really	3715	A
okay what is that	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
oh really is this an artichoke dip because_1 a friend of mine had that at at one of her parties and it was really good but when she told me it was artichoke dip i was going oh no	3715	A
as i'm not much of a fan for artichoke-	3715	A
that one see i thought that was something else	3715	A
huh	3715	A
huh	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah that's a party- it sounds like the same thing my friend served and it was really good but when she told me it had artichokes in i thought oh God	3715	A
yeah uh-huh it was	3715	A
well my husband loved it yeah he really did	3715	A
oh really huh	3715	A
yeah okay yeah and he wanted uh uh some uh chili dip that i usually make too so	3715	A
oh yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
and no women and children allowed and i	3715	A
yeah i guess so well um let me see we went to a Christmas party and uh a friend of mine had this and it was she had the she was the one that had that dip	3715	A
and another thing that my husband really liked that i and i liked too that i would have never thought of serving and it was really easy	3715	A
um and it sounds- it doesn't sound good but when you all put when you put it together and you taste it it's real- excellent it's um the Mexicorn and	3715	A
and corn chips you mix all that together with a bottle of the Catalina dressing and you and you just mix it all together and you serve it like that and it is really good	3715	A
well i	3715	B
you you could probably probably get uh the sub might work	3715	B
uh the beer will definitely work a lot of that	3715	B
and uh chips and dips will probably work	3715	B
uh not really to be honest with you i mean i i've never i've never really cared i just like little munchies and stuff basically you know just dip chips and dip usually do it if there's enough of it	3715	B
but	3715	B
males usually aren't into meals you know like more than- and not as much as women you know like just sitting around and eat the finger sandwiches and stuff	3715	B
and but uh i've always- i've always you know just had chips dip and beer and just gone for it from there	3715	B
i got a i got a good dip	3715	B
yeah i- i stole it from a restaurant	3715	B
it is uh you get a can of can of uh chopped spinach	3715	B
and you get uh fresh Parmesan Cheese	3715	B
and you get uh uh artichoke hearts	3715	B
okay you get uh a whole can of artichoke hearts	3715	B
you take about out of the i tell you out of the it's about a four ounce can of spinach out of that you take about an ounce and a half to two ounces of spinach	3715	B
okay you stick all of it in a food processor	3715	B
okay you need to get uh	3715	B
and you grind- mix it up real good it's almost pureed	3715	B
to a degree and you heat that up	3715	B
and you take uh i'd say approximately eight ounces of the fresh Parmesan Cheese and you uh put it in there while it's heating up	3715	B
and you mix it up	3715	B
and this is a recipe from Houston's restaurant	3715	B
that i stole yeah	3715	B
yeah	3715	B
yeah this is artichokes spinach and parmesan cheese and that's all that's in there	3715	B
oh i'm sorry and heavy it has heavy cream in it too	3715	B
i forgot forgot about that	3715	B
it has heavy cream in there i- i- i just i fling it every time i do it i	3715	B
mean i don't have anything written down i just kind of know it from i just go by taste and texture	3715	B
i've never really written it down but they never give me any specs on it i've just kind of	3715	B
had a variance of it you know every time i go in and it gets pretty close you've just got to watch how much spinach you put in there you've got to put it a little bit at a time it should be a uh	3715	B
uh uh like- about a guacamole- lighter than a guacamole color	3715	B
yeah and it's served	3715	B
yeah and it's served hot	3715	B
it's served hot	3715	B
it yeah and it's real good i don't know if they'd go for that or not but it's just a real good dip	3715	B
yeah it's a fancy- i think in Houston's it's called a Chicago dip	3715	B
yeah	3715	B
if you ever go there try it that's the stuff	3715	B
chili is usually guys usually go for chili now that you now that you mention it	3715	B
probably go for chili and beer that's always a good gas burner	3715	B
that's right	3715	B
plenty- plenty of ceiling fans going	3715	B
uh-huh	3715	B
right	3715	B
huh	3715	B
so national health care i don't know about you but for me i am voting for the next democrat for the president uh that says he's going to do something about a national health care program	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
yeah i myself uh	3748	A
i haven't worked for three years because of some medical problems and uh if i had not had insurance	3748	A
with the company i worked with at the time i believe i would have died and that worries me thinking cause i know a lot of people that don't have any coverage at all	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
well i i think that paying for it on your own it is like in my case i am up to about two hundred thousand dollars worth of health care i don't think that would have been possible for the majority of the people in this world	3748	A
so but then again there is uh the high cost of medical care is out unreal	3748	A
uh-huh	3748	A
well i think somewhere along the line whatever plan they come up with it is going to have to keep the doctors in a high paying field	3748	A
uh i myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more years and uh he is doing it for the money	3748	A
so	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked out for the people that can't afford it	3748	A
right	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
i found out yeah i uh my mother is on Medicare Medicaid whatever and uh i know it doesn't pay all of her medical- hospital bills and so forth	3748	A
and i think it is kind of a shame that at this point in her life she still has to pay quite a bit whenever she is in the hospital several thousand for you know for a weeks stay if she ends up having to pay	3748	A
uh-huh	3748	A
i know one uh not this Christmas but the Christmas before she was out here and we were out at Smithville which is a little town out east of here and	3748	A
we had to take her to the hospital on a Sunday afternoon for a back problem uh fairly minor she just strained it sprained it but	3748	A
when the bills starting coming in she had already gone home so i got a chance to look at them and i was shocked i mean i had been through a lot	3748	A
i mean with medical bills but when i saw what they did to her that day and it cost about three thousand dollars just to uh get a prescription for some pain pills basically	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
well that doesn't happen i	3748	A
it is weird i was in the hospital for like eight days back in October uh so many mistakes were made during my time there that i uh literally left the hospital in a taxi cab	3748	A
just to get away from the place i was scared as to what they were going to do to me next	3748	A
and when i got the bill it was outrageous uh pills that i had never heard of that i had taken which i know that i didn't i mean i wasn't ill i was just in for some routine stuff and it goes on and on	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
right	3748	A
i think Kerrey is and i think also Jerry Brown from California are interested uh actually the way Bush has been going the last few weeks i think he may be interested uh he he seem to be	3748	A
yeah uh	3748	A
yeah up until just recently i i would have thought Bush would uh you know i still he has done a pretty good job	3748	A
yeah i uh i basically agree uh i have	3748	B
mixed feelings i guess there are some uh	3748	B
somehow there needs to be some controls on the rising costs of of health care	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah if you if you don't have a very good paying job or you are not with a company that provides it it is uh pretty much unaffordable uh to pay for it on your own	3748	B
yeah that is right	3748	B
yeah i have a friend who uh uh is from uh lived at lived in London or lived in London and he lives here now where they do have medical- uh health care uh there and i guess	3748	B
i guess there is some disadvantages too i guess uh uh because of that they there has been a great uh	3748	B
migration of of doctors from there over to more lucrative practices and sometimes i guess it does effect the quality of health care somewhat so	3748	B
i-	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah yeah they don't have i think they don't get into it for any other reason	3748	B
um	3748	B
yes uh i uh agree too and also the uh the elderly a lot of times when they uh reach retirement uh	3748	B
they can't afford any any supplemental insurance beyond what is provided through Medicare and Medicaid and sometimes that is not enough to to cover the costs	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah particularly for people who are on uh on on just living mostly on social security or something like that they don't have enough extra money to pay for that	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah yeah	3748	B
uh in i guess in addition to uh uh national health care policy there uh there has to be some sort of	3748	B
monitoring i guess too of the overall medical field and hospital costs and and	3748	B
uh	3748	B
yeah yeah	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah i am afraid right now there is a lot of i guess you would have to call it just basic fraud in the in in the business cause they know they can turn a lot of these things in and they are not uh questioned at all	3748	B
uh i don't know which one of the uh democratic candidates either either Kerrey or Clinton i guess one of those two i can't remember which is pretty much in favor of some sort of	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
well he's he's probably campaigning i don't know how serious he is but	3748	B
well Nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um yeah i agree i also think that there are more um the people are women stay single longer it seems like	3743	A
yeah i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty two so	3743	A
you know um i know that	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
yeah yeah seems like there uh-huh go ahead	3743	A
oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too i mean that's there're a lot of	3743	A
either divorced or um	3743	A
you know never been married so	3743	A
yeah i agree	3743	A
well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah and it really it's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um	3743	A
i mean i i don't blame anybody when they have to work because_1 um yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah well what do you think's gonna happen in the next generation you think it'll continue yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah it is i think some	3743	A
i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children i guess i see that happening already	3743	A
some choosing it and and they get you know there're people chide them_1 for it you know why aren't you out	3743	A
well of course working	3743	B
including me well what do you think it is	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yes they do yeah they do	3743	B
right	3743	B
uh-huh yeah	3743	B
yeah that's true it's a big change i'm an OB nurse and so i really do see what you're saying there	3743	B
it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients' ages	3743	B
and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young so yeah you're right there's a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties	3743	B
so that's true but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers	3743	B
if they didn't have if they weren't out there working and having their careers	3743	B
they probably would be married and having their children so i guess it's a combination	3743	B
no go on	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of mixed up families that's for sure yeah	3743	B
well just that i think the families	3743	B
the the role in the family and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children	3743	B
um we do it all i really think that and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers	3743	B
have the major role i really do i think they're just	3743	B
they're not doing very much less i don't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides	3743	B
i think that we're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves	3743	B
oh it is	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yeah it's it's difficult and i think that i live in Plano actually so	3743	B
it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better	3743	B
and i really hate that you know i hate to see that and- and i've been here for a very long time	3743	B
but um	3743	B
i don't know now i'm a single parent and i don't have a choice anymore but	3743	B
i used to just work occasionally for extra money but now i have to work all the time and that's really hard and and i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and	3743	B
and leave the kids in a way it's good it's very good to get out with adults and i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and	3743	B
and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's	3743	B
not very smart i think that's difficult on them_1 so	3743	B
well it's gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but i'm not sure how it's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford	3743	B
to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it	3743	B
and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards	3743	B
but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it	3743	B
and they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families it's hard to say	3743	B
uh-huh	3743	B
uh so what do you like best about golf	3779	A
really	3779	A
really	3779	A
yeah i play uh i play probably four or five times a week my my wife and kids	3779	A
don't like it too much but	3779	A
it's such a great game i- i- i play three- you know thirty six holes after work	3779	A
and then uh	3779	A
yeah it does in the summertime in the winter it's too you know but uh you know i go to the indoor driving range all all winter and uh	3779	A
and uh i practice putting and it's it's a fun game	3779	A
oh really	3779	A
that sounds great	3779	A
well i have to do that because i love golf and	3779	A
well	3779	A
Cathy is that your name Cathy um	3779	A
do you-	3779	A
do you uh	3779	A
do you have a favorite golfer	3779	A
professional golfer excuse me my wife is making fun of me	3779	A
yeah she hates it when i you know she thinks it's funny that i got golf as a topic because_1 you know she dislikes it so much so	3779	A
yeah	3779	A
Greg Norman why	3779	A
are you sure you're not attracted to him or anything	3779	A
uh-huh	3779	A
yeah yeah i like Tom he's good	3779	A
yeah i'll agree with you there Cathy	3779	A
yeah he does	3779	A
uh i'd have to say uh	3779	A
i- i still like the Golden Bear you know	3779	A
oh yeah i- i like the senior tour i- i think it's got more personality	3779	A
you know and the names don't change every week you know	3779	A
so	3779	A
sure	3779	A
sure	3779	A
really	3779	A
my kids	3779	A
do you have kids Cathy	3779	A
i'm starting them off young i'm gonna get them oh you got a boy good	3779	A
he does has he got a pretty good stance	3779	A
huh	3779	A
oh	3779	A
huh	3779	A
well that's true	3779	A
that's true he's out getting some sunshine anyway	3779	A
i like to watch golf my husband plays golf and i've i've really become	3779	B
fairly acquainted with the game it's pretty interesting to watch i think my favorite part of the game is the putting part	3779	B
uh-huh do you play	3779	B
oh my	3779	B
well i've already	3779	B
good heavens	3779	B
it must stay light out there pretty well	3779	B
in the summer- well yeah in the summer uh-huh	3779	B
um-hum	3779	B
there's a place here in Dallas it's called Dave and Buster's	3779	B
and they have a laser well it's like lasers golf game	3779	B
where there's three beams and you take your clubs and you hit the ball and they give you a screen of what you would be seeing from where you lie	3779	B
it's really a lot of fun and it's it's fairly comparable to some of the nicer golf courses around here the nicer public courses the price of it is	3779	B
if you're ever in Dallas you'd have to go to Dave and Buster's	3779	B
it is a very fine game i think it teaches a lot of goodness- a lot of good um	3779	B
attributes	3779	B
to people	3779	B
yeah you got it right	3779	B
do i have a favorite golfer	3779	B
oh talking about golf on the T I thing	3779	B
uh when you start up on golf	3779	B
well you probably picked it though on your list of of topics to speak about	3779	B
um i would say that my favorite golfer is Greg Norman	3779	B
there's just something about the way he plays golf he just approaches the ball	3779	B
so confidently	3779	B
and the way he hits he's just really he's got kind of a funny swing but beyond that he's really he seems a very confident player and he does	3779	B
he does play fairly well	3779	B
what about yourself-	3779	B
well that may be too he's he's not the most attractive guy on the on the tour i'll say that but uh	3779	B
i guess after watching	3779	B
for so long for so long i've been i've been watching and hearing about golf from my husband for	3779	B
six years six and a half years or a little more	3779	B
and after a while you get to where yeah you start watching who plays well and who doesn't i think Tom Kite is another good player	3779	B
he's got a real ugly stance but	3779	B
he does he he does play real well and he he seems to almost always win	3779	B
so he's so that's got to say a lot for him right there that he just wins quite often	3779	B
what about yourself who is your favorite player	3779	B
even on the even on the senior tour	3779	B
well yeah well the guys have	3779	B
the there's one thing that's true yeah you can always count on Lee and Chichi and Don January and	3779	B
and uh oh yeah the Golden Bear out there hitting them_1 up	3779	B
putting them_1 in	3779	B
uh-huh yeah i have a young boy	3779	B
uh-huh oh he already plays golf he's not eighteen months and he golfs around the house	3779	B
uh-huh	3779	B
no he's horrible but but he loves	3779	B
to he's got a a set of three little plastic clubs and little plastic balls and he takes his club and he whacks the ball around the house and he whacks the cat and then he'll get a big play ball and bounce it around with his club	3779	B
but he really enjoys taking them out and he likes to watch his daddy practice swing and putt around the house so	3779	B
yeah i'm i'm already a golf widow and i don't mind it i mean i know where my husband is when he's out	3779	B
and he's in a very wholesome environment while he's out there so	3779	B
yeah	3779	B
it's	3779	B
yeah i've been with i was with uh TI for uh thirty four years so obviously i found something worth worth doing there and have prejudices about uh what i want	3786	B
yeah uh where do you work	3786	B
oh	3786	B
yeah they uh	3786	B
i'm not sure what the category's supposed to be uh but it was what	3786	B
something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company	3786	B
uh	3786	B
other other than salary didn't it say yeah	3786	B
well i'm i thought it said other than salary but yeah	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with Chance-Vought before i joined uh	3786	B
there and ironically i left Chance-Vought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some	3786	B
thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company	3786	B
and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh	3786	B
then it became Dallas County's largest employer oh	3786	B
but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh	3786	B
wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh	3786	B
heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time	3786	B
and it's amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them	3786	B
uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing	3786	B
and power and they they just couldn't understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others	3786	B
uh including IBM's that in the technical community salary was never first it was usually about third and yeah	3786	B
right	3786	B
right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort	3786	B
uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes was the salary	3786	B
and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the	3786	B
oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you know because- because_1 they just couldn't believe that that people weren't motivated by money	3786	B
yeah well i'm sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but	3786	B
in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could get- you could get a job elsewhere anytime- any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh	3786	B
in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing	3786	B
-hello okay so you were with TI huh	3786	A
well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right	3786	A
i uh work for myself i sell uh metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh uh	3786	A
oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i can't really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time	3786	A
and uh i think most people don't necessarily realize the cost of them_1 and they're somewhat probably getting out of hand	3786	A
well	3786	A
i think uh	3786	A
oh the way i got-	3786	A
right well no it didn't necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess	3786	A
such as	3786	A
well i i imagine that's what they're referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh	3786	A
and they grew up around you didn't it	3786	A
uh-huh	3786	A
yeah	3786	A
um-hum	3786	A
right right	3786	A
well i think as long as it's comparable with you know the job or can	3786	A
that uh you aren't being picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i	3786	A
yes yes	3786	A
well-	3786	A
right	3786	A
well i i wouldn't say they aren't motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are	3786	A
equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh	3786	A
yes	3786	A
right	3786	A
right	3786	A
oh okay	3771	B
um well you're in quite a um interesting city for um crime drugs and all kinds of things that we hear about aren't you	3771	B
oh i see uh-huh	3771	B
uh-huh i see	3771	B
um	3771	B
yeah	3771	B
well it's probably- each city i guess has its own specific type of difficulty	3771	B
oh there's a lot of homicides in Dallas that seems to be	3771	B
uh well a lot of it is drug related but i- i think that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms bearing uh you know personal arms bearing	3771	B
uh and it it seems to just lend itself to instantaneous um if you're don't feel good about a certain thing there you go and the crime is committed so uh	3771	B
um	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
oh i see um-hum	3771	B
i'm not sure i know sufficiently about the ins and outs of the law to um	3771	B
know exactly what that brings about you know the the appeals and things like that as far as the people being um retrialed and maybe get an alleviated sentence	3771	B
it does seem though that the jail capacities are stretching to the fullest and uh	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
oh	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum that's right	3771	B
um	3771	B
uh-huh	3771	B
that's right i believe that	3771	B
um-hum um-hum	3771	B
oh my in the parking lot oh yes uh-huh um	3771	B
um	3771	B
it's very difficult to know what the answer is and uh along with that there's a lot of poverty- poverty a lot of homeless and	3771	B
and a lot of um i guess um discrimination is still around and	3771	B
i- i suppose until somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things people are just going to take an extreme uh measure and um uh protect themselves in one way or the other	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
uh-huh	3771	B
oh	3771	B
oh i didn't know that	3771	B
oh that's very strange	3771	B
because uh discuss crime in America and what we might be able- uh do to uh help stop it	3771	A
oh yeah well actually i- i- i live in Houston i'm in Miami on business	3771	A
uh but i've i've been down here quite a bit for the past oh six months on and off	3771	A
and yes there is plenty of crime in Miami uh but you know um i don't know that it's any worse than Houston	3771	A
and i know there's plenty of crime in Dallas too	3771	A
yeah	3771	A
yeah i have uh i was talking with some with- with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the United States but i'm almost of the opinion	3771	A
that the only way that a change is going to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh	3771	A
have a a swift and and sure justice that uh you know do away with some of these automatic uh appeals when uh i think that guilt is proven	3771	A
well in in Houston it's absurd they are letting uh uh people that have been convicted three times for armed robbery	3771	A
for example and this was they had a big article in the Houston newspaper about it	3771	A
because of the overcrowding they're being released from Huntsville they're given two hundred dollars and put on a bus for Houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer	3771	A
less than twenty percent or twenty- ten percent it was a ridiculously low low number actually do ever report to a parole- parole officer	3771	A
and the vast majority of them_1 are then caught again go through the courts back to jail well it's ludicrous and absurd	3771	A
and i- i just don't think that you know we as a society can afford to continue to have these people that are repeat offenders being paroled after serving	3771	A
a a fraction sometimes you know a quarter of their sentence	3771	A
but uh i- i don't know it's uh i don't own a gun	3771	A
and uh i you know i believe and i adhere to the thought that	3771	A
you know if you so often i mean it's it's having a gun leads to tragedy	3771	A
and at the same and at the same time	3771	A
i think i have thought before what would i do if i were accosted	3771	A
you know	3771	A
a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in Houston and was robbed	3771	A
broad open daylight in the parking lot	3771	A
so anyway it it is it's a scary situation and i really don't know what this what the answer	3771	A
yeah i've i'm i'm a firm believer though that uh our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence	3771	A
uh and- and knowing that the parole uh will come uh uh just in a short matter of time not only that we have people in jail now that i mean if had a program on Sixty Minutes i mean that they have telephones	3771	A
in their jail cells it's absurd	3771	A
yeah so i mean i don't know	3771	A
yeah i don't know it's yeah	3771	A
oh yeah i got three how about_1 yourself	3727	A
oh you've got uh young children then	3727	A
oh my goodness that's great	3727	A
what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or	3727	A
two boys	3727	A

i don't blame you well-	3727	A
well	3727	A
well we got two boys and a girl also- well we got two boys and a girl well uh	3727	A
yes yes so maybe- maybe maybe you'll get lucky and get a girl this time	3727	A
well our boys one is uh	3727	A

kind of	3727	A
well it's a program for	3727	A

i got a brother-in-law just got back from a trip to Alaska	3731	B
and uh he said that was quite a bit of fun uh i guess the salmon are pretty good fighters and uh they went uh out in the you know more of the deep sea fishing as well caught a fair amount of halibut	3731	B
and they say the halibut are are a pretty good fighter too	3731	B
they're an odd fish i don't know if you ever seen- i guess they lie on the flat on the bottom of the ocean and they only have one eye or or just a small eye on the other side	3731	B
as halibut	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
do they put up a fight or not	3731	B
once you get them over- to over to the side of the boat because_1 they're they're pretty pretty weighty fish are they yeah do you net those or i guess you have to huh	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
you know i've never eaten catfish are they good eating	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
is that right	3731	B
kind of an ugly looking fish are they great big whiskers on them_1	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
oh yeah	3731	B
taste a little better yeah well these trout that we catch are real good i- i quite enjoy those uh they this place where we go with uh with my six year old they uh filet them for you right there for only like ten cents a fish i mean it's well worth it	3731	B
so you just fry them up right	3731	B
okay uh	3731	A
what kind of fishing is there up in Utah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
well i was i was raised on Alabama coast and i like salt water fishing	3731	A
and Dallas is there's quite a few lakes around here i've	3731	A
done some fishing from the shore i don't have a boat which you really need to get out into the lakes uh you know really do any good	3731	A
i've	3731	A
i've caught a few striped bass from the shore some of the small ones	3731	A
and then catfish and stuff i haven't done a lot since i moved to Dallas	3731	A
oh	3731	A
off and on for ten years we were here	3731	A
six years and my wife got homesick we moved backed to Alabama Mobile spent about eight months and moved back to Dallas because_1 the	3731	A
wages and all were better up here	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
right	3731	A
yeah i did that a couple of times the company i had worked for in Mobile they had a	3731	A
couple of bunch of us guys got together and we and chartered a boat and	3731	A
went out caught red snapper and one guy caught a ling	3731	A
and i caught a few what they call trigger fish	3731	A
but the it wasn't	3731	A
yeah and we'd constantly getting our lines tangled up with people- people fishing on both sides of the boat so	3731	A
it was one uh fish were good but it was kind of a hassle	3731	A
um	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
um	3731	A
okay well we we catch flounder on the coast which is about the same thing	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
uh well they hug the bottom they	3731	A
they don't run that much but they they	3731	A
somehow they hug the bottom and it's kind of you find- it's a pretty good struggle to put them_1 in you know pull them_1 in once they get	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
uh	3731	A
i've caught i've caught one on a hook with live shrimp i've	3731	A
caught several of them_1 in cast nets	3731	A
yeah about yeah you would have to net them_1 to get them_1 in the boat because_1 they really have a small mouth and all	3731	A
but i've i've fished mostly you know	3731	A
when i was on the coast in the in the bays and stuff in a little you know plywood skiff	3731	A
and	3731	A
well the water's kind of brackish so i	3731	A
i catch a mixture of salt water and fresh water fish right with	3731	A
right on the coast you know i catch	3731	A
catfish in the bayou and go	3731	A
a half a mile and catch a you know salt water fish	3731	A
yeah they they real good they	3731	A
and so that i guess	3731	A
you know people on the coast and all consider them that's the best around	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah they they	3731	A
yeah they are and they're bottom feeders if you	3731	A
if you get them_1 out of real muddy water then they got a muddy taste to them_1 but if you	3731	A
you know catch them_1 out of clear running water they they're pretty good	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
what kind of hobbies do you find yourself involved with	3733	A
huh	3733	A
yes	3733	A
ah uh woodworking um very little actually uh	3733	A
no um	3733	A
oh no they- they uh they they suggested a variety of possibilities and of whatever hobbies- hobbies you can come up with uh no uh	3733	A
my hobbies kind of vary from time to time depending on what kind of time i've got uh i spent twenty years as an auto mechanic	3733	A
and i i enjoy working with with cars uh i've built a couple of race cars uh	3733	A
uh yeah um	3733	A
also- i do enjoy woodworking- uh	3733	A
uh cabinet cabinetry type woodworking	3733	A
um	3733	A
i've done some model building and	3733	A
different things like that um	3733	A
right now hobbies pretty much tend to be on hold	3733	A
with a twelve week old baby and	3733	A
full time student hobbies are a extreme luxury	3733	A
you say- you say you uh sing with a group in a community college	3733	A
what sort of music do you work with	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
yes	3733	A
that sounds like a lot of fun	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
those are usually the best sorts	3733	A
i you you say show music like Broadway musical type show music	3733	A
okay	3733	A
hum	3733	A
-those are wonderful shows	3733	A
oh yeah yeah	3733	A
yeah well the the chances are these are all all things they're very familiar with and just the chance to have some entertainment and some some variety in their life	3733	A
at- at retirement homes i mean even still there are variety there- there're a lot of	3733	A
retirement homes that try to make it sound like it's a real you know luxury condominium setup but- still the you know the bulk of the people living there tend to be living pretty restricted lives	3733	A
so something like that can be a lot of fun	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
uh-huh	3733	A
oh yeah	3733	A
oh that sounds	3733	A
well i find myself involved in um singing with a group at the local community college	3733	B
and also embroidering and especially cooking i like to uh cook and uh have been in charge of various events	3733	B
and sometimes i embroider when i have really a bit of spare time	3733	B
now it seems you're interested in woodworking	3733	B
what kind of woodworking do you do	3733	B
uh oh	3733	B
i thought that's what they said um-hum	3733	B
oh i see um-hum	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
i see	3733	B
um-hum um-hum	3733	B
oh you have	3733	B
oh my	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
yeah	3733	B
oh my uh-huh	3733	B
uh-huh	3733	B
uh yes um	3733	B
well we we work with show music and with uh opera arias and actually we're very fortunate to have a um	3733	B
former opera singer uh from New York who is relocated to	3733	B
Dallas and uh she has taken over the the vocal music department at one of the community colleges here in Dallas and uh she both gives private lessons and has um	3733	B
a variety of classes especially on Saturdays for um people that are interested and what i found- i've been going over there for about three or four years now	3733	B
and what we found is that there winds up being a core group of us that um keep on coming back	3733	B
and uh we give performances at the college and at the uh Botanical Gardens in the spring time and at various retirement homes and things of that nature	3733	B
and you can um select whatever things you want to work on for the semester and she'll help you with them and give you um lots of good points and uh it it's a very	3733	B
enjoyable group uh it's not um overly formal that you have to worry it's not professional but it's good and i enjoy it very much	3733	B
yeah uh-huh	3733	B
right uh-huh i've i've personally done some things from Camelot and from My Fair Lady you know things like that um	3733	B
uh and uh some of the people really are just very	3733	B
fine singers we kind of enjoy one another	3733	B
so uh and and when we go out to those retirement homes or the nursing homes	3733	B
the people are very very appreciative which also makes you very happy that you're able to kind of pick up somebody else's life also so	3733	B
right um-hum	3733	B
yes	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
oh yes	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
yeah	3733	B
i i really uh that's really what we have found and also um a lot of the people are very knowledgeable	3733	B
uh in in the field of music they're just very knowledgeable about a lot of things and they'll come and talk to you afterwards and um	3733	B
you better know your onions but uh it it is something i do enjoy very much so and the other thing i like to do is	3733	B
uh cook i have um uh	3733	B
uh planned uh menus for various organizations and this year i was asked to take care of uh several luncheons and dinners up at my children's school	3733	B
and the next thing that we're getting ready for is a big faculty luncheon and we're gonna give them Italian food	3733	B
really	3729	B
you know i just did last week as a matter of fact um i'm wondering if their subject is more uh products by mail or things that you buy at the store but um	3729	B
i bought something through the mail through a merchant through a company that's generally got pretty good products and	3729	B
i was really impressed with the way they handled the return policy they sent UPS to our door to pick it up free of charge which is such a an unusual always have to go to the	3729	B
post office or some place to return it usually	3729	B
it was Hannah Anderson the children's um clothing	3729	B
do they	3729	B
it really is	3729	B
it took a while because it was the holiday weeks um	3729	B
it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive we're we're fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but	3729	B
it would've probably been an inconvenience if if it had been a home pickup and and we hadn't been here but they were also willing to pick up at work	3729	B
it was defective we returned it for the same thing um in a little larger size but it seemed that it was stitched uh around the collar such that the second time she wore it it uh it ripped	3729	B
and and i think that's unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that um	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
yeah	3729	B
exactly yeah and it it's unfortunate you really cannot depend on the the department store's name for that necessarily i don't know if you have Nordstroms in Dallas	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably carry- carry overall pretty good merchandise you you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store	3729	B
yeah surprisingly	3729	B
no	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
um you know i don't know that i bet they probably do but i i'm not sure that i've	3729	B
associated some of what i've seen as lines that they always carry as their own brand or just something that they've um gotten at a at a lower uh price because it's a large volume some of their children's lines	3729	B
i tend to look there for kids' things because they don't they they sometimes have things that you can't find elsewhere because_1 they have a pretty large variety but not often for myself	3729	B
not that much actually i used to i think before i had a child and because you end up paying for the shipping and handling and everything um	3729	B
and you don't always have the convenience of returning it if it's not right uh i- i tend less often to do that today than i might've ten years ago	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
exactly	3729	B
um-hum um-hum	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider it you	3729	B
you find that it's a lot more inconvenient to have to arrange for returning it if it's by mail	3729	B
yeah it is funny you know i'm also amazed at uh	3729	B
that i read about those i don't know anybody who does this but that people buy clothes and wear them and then think that they can return them	3729	B
that's what	3729	B
uh-huh was this Spiegel by any chance	3729	A
don't know that one i know Spiegel does that and yes and uh to me that's very impressive to think that	3729	A
but well and did you have any problem obviously had no problem with returning it	3729	A
oh well	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
did	3729	A
did you return it because it was defective or because you just didn't like it	3729	A
huh	3729	A
well i know what you mean because a couple years ago i remember i was in one of the nicer department stores and looking at it was one of the designer T-shirts or some sort of thing like that and the thing	3729	A
it was very expensive you know as they always are and it was a piece of junk you know stitching was terrible i think that they were trying to just you know play on a name	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
no we don't i've been to one of the Nordstroms in um uh New York	3729	A
nice store	3729	A
do you really	3729	A
do you have Lord and Taylor there	3729	A
um uh we're originally from Saint Louis and we came down to Dallas and they have Lord and Taylors here and i look at a lot of their house brands and i am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands in some of the stores	3729	A
does Nordstroms carry their own house brand	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
do you shop by mail quite a bit	3729	A
it's not as inexpensive-	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
that's the only problem that i see because uh my sister gets tons of catalogs and passes them on to me and i look at things and they have some gorgeous clothes but the problem is that	3729	A
you can't always go by sizes you know you'll go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different manufacturers and they all fit you know differently but uh that's the main thing is that i can't tell	3729	A
whether the thing is going to fit or not	3729	A
and so i tend not to mail order	3729	A
but	3729	A
i-	3729	A
well personally i always try on before i buy anyway i just it amazes me when i talk to people that they buy like they buy a bunch of clothes and they don't try anything on they take them home	3729	A
oh okay well that's a different story right	3729	A
i hear about that too and that just appalls me i mean that's stealing really	3729	A
my name is Ferrell	3752	B
where are you calling from	3752	B
Miami i'm in Utah	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
yes it is definitely	3752	B
sure go ahead	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
i uh have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years	3752	B
and uh i'm almost convinced there's a lot of it has to do with environment uh	3752	B
she taught in a poor area poor area here in Utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the S A T scores	3752	B
in all the districts of the state	3752	B
and uh	3752	B
the district we're presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from from home	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah well you know you see these documentaries on uh on Japan for example and the uh rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week	3752	B
uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do	3752	B
now we have that to a to a degree here that's only because we have a little bit of a of a problem that's i guess peculiar to Utah and we have a a high population of young young people	3752	B
young children one of the larger uh uh student teacher ratios you know average class size is probably thirty five or something like that	3752	B
and that poses another problem where the you know just the individual attention that's needed sometimes uh is lacking because of the you know the shear numbers of it and what they've gone to is a year round program here where	3752	B
uh in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round	3752	B
but you have uh you go like for uh eleven weeks and you're off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these these four periods rather than than the classic summer vacation	3752	B
these are just mostly the elementary grades however	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
oh	3752	B
regardless of where they live huh	3752	B
oh	3752	B
oh that's that's interesting it's kind of like uh turning it over to the private sector to some degree	3752	B
and the the supply and demand works yeah	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
that's an interesting concept	3752	B
yeah yeah i i the stories you read about the competency and the literacy of the high school graduates for example	3752	B
i can't believe it you	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah their their awareness of the of the uh current events and geography like you were mentioned early	3752	B
uh uh i just find it	3752	B
are you ready-	3752	A
i'm calling from Miami	3752	A
Utah well we've got a long distance connection tonight	3752	A
you ready to start i am	3752	A
well you know the first thing i thought about whenever uh i don't have children but i um have a friend who's a school teacher and uh	3752	A
she has told me some horror stories but uh other than that i was thinking about um the the fact that uh so many uh kids nowadays can't even identify on the map on a globe where they are	3752	A
and it's just astounding to me	3752	A
um	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah and i think you're right i think an awful lot of it has to do with uh the kind of emphasis that uh	3752	A
the the children get uh at home on education because um uh this friend of mine who's a school teacher was telling me she said uh you know uh	3752	A
that she has uh uh kids that uh are are Indian and Pakistani uh Oriental you know some of them who uh have only been uh in the United States maybe for two generations	3752	A
that uh she said their English is excellent uh their their social- social skills are good and uh you know why is it that uh that they can be such model citizens and uh yet	3752	A
you know other young kids- uh uh kids who have you know been uh born and uh bred here in the US uh just don't seem to get it	3752	A
right	3752	A
yeah i'm beginning to wonder if maybe um year round school would not be a bad uh a bad thing	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah well i don't know i uh i uh	3752	A
i don't certainly don't have the answer to it i know that uh um in Houston uh for example where i'm i have some friends who uh uh	3752	A
were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that uh uh they want their kids to go to	3752	A
and uh	3752	A
yeah right and uh the idea of running a a school	3752	A
sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful uh uh uh less successful get less money uh	3752	A
yeah the	3752	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3752	A
but i don't know if that's the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way	3752	A
oh it's a nightmare	3752	A
well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write	3752	A
it's scary	3752	A
uh-huh	3752	A
all right Miss Kathy so uh what do you do do you do it regularly and so forth	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
well uh i have been so busy working i just retired about two weeks ago	3767	A
thank you my exercise basically has been what walking that i can get in	3767	A
which hasn't really been quite enough but i could very definitely tell the difference when i have two or three hours off and i run around on campus i'm retired from Penn State University	3767	A
and when i have an afternoon to walk around on campus i- i very definitely uh see a difference	3767	A
and it it i know that walking is good for you and uh i keep reading that it's much better for you than running because of the uh actions of the joints and so forth	3767	A
but uh tell me about_1 um your exercise did you take your exercise because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or whatever	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
how many how many hours a week do you estimate that you perform these things	3767	A
an hour a day uh-huh	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
do you ever have time when you don't get this exercise in and notice that your weight goes up or anything like that	3767	A
oh it's so you you can tell the difference	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
i- i understand what you're saying well what about eating do you uh	3767	A
do anything about the the type of food you eat is that uh or do you just eat a normal balanced meal to go with that	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
yeah that that does keep you busy	3767	A
so you well uh	3767	A
well there're just two of us now my three children have all moved out	3767	A
so uh diet wise uh i'm trying to keep us on a low	3767	A
uh weight the low fat type of a diet my wife has high cholesterol	3767	A
so i'm trying to keep that down and and i do notice that when you go through	3767	A
periods uh such as Christmas and so forth where you eat out more often than normal if you don't get the exercise in your weight weight goes up	3767	A
and uh for me exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing -that weight down	3767	A
and-	3767	A
no it's up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say walking around on campus picking up mail and and doing things like that	3767	A
and running- running downtown uh during my lunch period	3767	A
well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in and	3767	A
yes	3767	A
do you we have a bicycle in the house	3767	A
uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do	3767	A
have you ever tried one of those	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
uh-huh -well i was thinking with you say you have four children	3767	A
with four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you	3767	A
well very good	3767	A
well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh as i say i've just retired so i'm just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and i'm	3767	A
considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control	3767	A
no i have one lives in Amsterdam Holland and uh one lives in uh	3767	A
near Warrington Pennsylvania and the other one is in New Jersey	3767	A
so	3767	A
well i- i have done research at Penn State i've i've uh not a teacher i've done research in under water acoustics	3767	A
it's been a noisy subject	3767	A
um yeah i do i play basketball on uh a city league and	3767	B
volleyball and	3767	B
how about_1 you	3767	B
oh congratulations	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
huh	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
yep	3767	B
um i do it purely for enjoyment in fact when i've started exercise programs that i felt like i had to do you know a system of doing so many sit ups and that i haven't stuck with it and haven't enjoyed it either one so	3767	B
i decided that i would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what i like more than just individual	3767	B
um whatever	3767	B
um probably	3767	B
at least an hour a day	3767	B
yeah do and i have four children so that keeps me busy too and they're all involved in	3767	B
sports mostly soccer so we	3767	B
once they're out there i you know i get out there and kick it around with them sometimes	3767	B
of course of course	3767	B
oh yeah not so much with weight as much as just not you know you feel sluggish and you get into that cycle where you don't want to exercise and so you don't and then you the the vicious cycle where	3767	B
where you don't exercise	3767	B
yeah i just eat normally i don't regulate- you know i'm not real regimented about what	3767	B
what i eat personally its too hard to to get myself on a certain diet having to fix for five other people in the house so	3767	B
yep	3767	B
how about_1 you	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
do you do it together with your wife or this mostly by yourself	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of walking in i know that i when i went to college you know just walking back and forth from different buildings you you have to	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
huh	3767	B
i haven't	3767	B
i haven't i do i have a bike and you know i usually have a child on the back of it because_1 mine are little	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
that would be a great- yeah it sure would that would be a great idea	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
oh that sounds	3767	B
yeah probably do your kids still live close by you	3767	B
oh	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
oh they're spread around what did you teach	3767	B
oh	3767	B
oh	3767	B
well that yeah well that would be interesting do you study like mammals or just sound	3767	B
what kind of crimes you have in Hattiesburg	3795	B
oh boy that's and Hattiesburg's not that big is it fifty thousand or so yeah	3795	B
well	3795	B
yeah we're real disgusted around here in Austin we live in the city and on December the sixth uh four teenage girls were murdered and mutilated two blocks from our house at a yogurt shop	3795	B
mutilated uh they cut them_1 up and they put ice cream inside their bodies and then they burnt the place down or tried to burn the place down as they left	3795	B
uh two of them_1 worked there and two of them_1 came to pick them_1 up when they got off their at at eleven o'clock that night and	3795	B
right or just shutting down just closing and i don't think the police have a clue uh they've had the FBI here and have some sort of analysis of who might have done it what type of person might have done it but	3795	B
yeah but	3795	B
it's just they're still begging for help and and and i just feel like some of they're helpless at uh trying to solve this one	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
that's true my wife and i read a lot of uh true crime books and you know court cases things like that	3795	B
and it boy it just upsets us when people get off with little or nothing they're they're on they're out on probation- probation in fifteen years after murdering half a dozen people and	3795	B
it's just not fair	3795	B
yes	3795	B
yeah i think about a year ago here in Austin they were we were uh the gang problem was getting real bad and they hired a hundred new policemen and a lot of them_1 were dedicated just to the crime unit or to the gang unit	3795	B
and just recently they announced that they've pretty much got it under control there was only one gang related murder this past year	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
i think one of the things that they need to do more of which i seen a little bit here in Austin though is getting actual people in neighborhoods involved	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
yeah uh	3795	B
seems to be that way i seems like everybody that we've heard of or know that go for any kind of psychiatric- psychiatric help uh every problem you've got is blamed on your parents	3795	B
and that to me that's just defeating the family right there	3795	B
i mean if you can	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
you know	3795	B
you know out of my own family i- i guess maybe i didn't have everything i wanted when i was growing up but i've as i've gotten older i've learned to accept the fact that i got what i needed i was clothed and sheltered and educated and	3795	B
i haven't blamed any of my future problems on on on the family upbringing or whatever	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
it's just i like i can't ever imagine my son committing a crime	3795	B
and i think he knows that you know that that's just something that not in in his world but there's so many people out there that do commit violent crimes and and small crimes and think nothing of it it's	3795	B
uh	3795	A
actually about anything you can imagine uh from you- you know this petty theft kind of crud going around vandalism up to uh certain amount of organized crime where uh	3795	A
gangs are starting to you know show up and actually you know qualify as gangs	3795	A
uh about_1 fifty- yeah right around fifty thousand we i think we- this census we just missed fifty thousand by a couple of people or something like that	3795	A
but uh yeah it's it's right at fifty thousand	3795	A
um-hum	3795	A
murdered and mutilated	3795	A
uh what these are girls who worked at this ice cream parlor or	3795	A
all right so this- so this is a place the the place had shut down already	3795	A
um	3795	A
yeah character profile psychiatric profile	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
ah shoot the the big problem is there's no real punishment for crime anymore i mean the bigger the crime the less likely you are to get punished for it	3795	A
i mean get adequately punished anyway	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
well they slaughter innocent- innocent- lots of innocent lives and they get you know a few years and a slap on the wrist and someone else turns around and you know embezzles a couple of thousand dollars from the local bank and they you know they practically get fried	3795	A
yes	3795	A
um-hum	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
that's good if nothing else they've got the gangs pushed down to where they're you know not going to be very active at least as far as you know murders or open crimes are concerned	3795	A
yeah the neighborhood watch type programs yeah that's one that's the one thing that starting you know the only two things that are really making a difference	3795	A
are when the local people get involved and when they start doing something positive with families families have gone in the toilet in the last twenty thirty years	3795	A
and it's as though they're really trying to push to make sure they go down the toilet lot of people- lot of institutions they seem to be fighting against family	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah well to a certain extent it can be traced back there and and and that's okay to say so as long as you understand that you got to forgive	3795	A
it's not like they doing it on purpose usually very seldom are they doing it on purpose	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
i had some modicum at least of acceptance and support	3795	A
yeah well that's the way it was with us we had i had a pretty good family life by comparison- i had an excellent family life by comparison to a lot of people out there	3795	A
it may not have been perfect but they did what they knew how to do and they did it the best they knew how so	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah i mean considering the conscious it seems to go it- it- it almost invariably does start with the destruction of the family i mean	3795	A
almost invariably children aren't taught respect they're not taught discipline they're not taught the need to	3795	A
see in the newspaper or on the news when uh President Bush fainted at a dinner it was that in Japan	3726	A
um	3726	A
well i thought it was pretty scary i i missed it uh i mean i when they were rerunning- rerunning it like the next day or something mean i didn't hear about it on the day it happened but i	3726	A
it was interesting you know that when he fainted and every one kind of jumped up on the table and surrounded him and it's really amazing that that would happen and then of course all the Dan Quayle discussion comes up again	3726	A
that's uh that is true that is real good well he you know as for as young as he is he seems to have had several health problems- you know health uh incidences if not problems	3726	A
right that's right well i um	3726	A
i guess i haven't really been i've been trying to tune out a lot of the political issues right now when because the campaigning is starting and uh so	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
right	3726	A
it is scary	3726	A
yes	3726	A
uh-huh	3726	A
right they're foreign students	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
well they seem	3726	A
well that's really true and but i have noticed from uh my associations with teenagers in high school that they are really motivated by how much money they can make and when they hear on the news about people being laid off	3726	A
and uh you know corporations and things i mean i feel like they don't wanna make the effort out of um their own personal interests to follow a particular field or they wanna think you know how quickly can they make money	3726	A
and they're not attracted by the the work that has to be done to achieve	3726	A
uh you know a position like that	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
right	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
well you're right when you say that um	3726	A
the important issues need to be not so as much what's going on other places i mean that it's important for us to do	3726	A
i mean we we can't be isolated here but um you know we do need to pay more attention to our own economy and	3726	A
and our own civilization because we've seen how quickly and it's almost unbelievable the fall of the um Soviet Union and and the um Berlin Wall and all of that's almost unreal to me still	3726	A
that was in Japan uh i didn't get to see that uh we've uh just gotten back yesterday from vacation	3726	B
and so i was bumping up and down the highway in a camper and uh i didn't get to watch any television so i've just been finding out about this once i got back	3726	B
yeah well i was kind of pleased that uh when i got back that that was the hot item on the news that uh the President had fainted at dinner because_1 that means that nothing else happened anywhere in the world	3726	B
yeah well you need about three kids running around the house and uh you you'd have your share of health problem too	3726	B
yeah	3726	B
well i think the key issue that's going on at the moment is the current economy	3726	B
and i think there's a lot of things that need to be done to to rectify that situation i'm not sure that the government is the key player	3726	B
um	3726	B
i think one of the statements that was made uh a year ago by uh Gorbachev	3726	B
when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the Soviet Union he made the comment he said well our country may be bankrupt but referring to the United States he says your schools are bankrupt	3726	B
and uh that's been a big concern for me	3726	B
and i noticed that uh when i go into the tougher courses at some of the universities like Organic Chemistry or something like that	3726	B
that uh you don't find very many white American males taking the tough courses	3726	B
you find you find a lot of Asian students uh you find uh a lot of females in the class	3726	B
and in all of the tough courses that i have taken the only blacks that i've found in the class have have generally been from Nigeria or some other African country they're foreign students	3726	B
and it's i think it's kind of pathetic that uh	3726	B
our kids are not motivated to uh	3726	B
to study in depth and uh to take the hard courses and i'm i'm concerned that that is our economic problem not not how much money is being spent at Christmas time	3726	B
um-hum	3726	B
yeah well i know when i went through school uh i went through an engineering school and of all my close friends they were all there because they loved engineering	3726	B
they loved building things they loved solving problems uh they liked	3726	B
you know being creative and there was another group of students there that were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of money	3726	B
and we didn't mix very well you know there was a a total difference in attitude and we felt very	3726	B
isolated or uh discriminated against in not being you know separate classes in terms of attitude	3726	B
um-hum	3726	B
yeah	3726	B
well that was a terribly precarious economy- economy uh i've been kind of watching it over the years and observing that the the amount of bureaucracy over there	3726	B
uh where did you go	3762	A
well interestingly enough i'm calling from Miami	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
well yeah	3762	A
well you know that's something i've never done is go down to the Keys although i i'm just here on business but uh i would love to go down there	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be	3762	A
when i was a kid uh we used to go camping up in the Ozarks in Arkansas	3762	A
and uh we found a pretty remote campground uh uh actually whenever we first started going to it you had to drive about twenty five miles on a gravel road	3762	A
to get back up into it and uh it had uh no electricity and uh it had a hand pump for water	3762	A
but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you	3762	A
but uh that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping	3762	A
yeah well now yeah you kind of remind me of a friend of mine who who said her idea of roughing it is slow room service	3762	A
but uh yeah i've got a uh i've got a friend of mine in Houston who has a forty two foot uh Tartan sailboat	3762	A
and uh it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because he's got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on it	3762	A
well that's hard work	3762	A
yeah i've i've been with it on on several uh races we've run the Pensacola yacht race for a couple of years	3762	A
and uh but no i love to sail and i agree i had never thought- really thought about that as camping before but that is- that is probably one of the best ways to go	3762	A
what did you do did you rent a motor home when you came to Florida	3762	A
was it what is that expensive	3762	A
well that's cheaper than a hotel room really	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
how big was the one you rented	3762	A
yeah was that uh any problem driving or	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
oh really	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah yeah	3762	A
oh sure yeah yeah that always irritates me when i pass somebody several times i've i've been in the other in the other uh uh uh had the shoe on the other foot	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah right right right	3762	A
uh	3762	A
no we just uh i guess i'm hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping	3762	B
in a recreational vehicle	3762	B
we took a tour of Florida	3762	B
okay well i was down there visiting the uh the orchid jungle	3762	B
there in uh Homestead	3762	B
came back with about ten plants that i hadn't planned on	3762	B
yeah we were down past Miami went down into the Keys	3762	B
um well we found it a little bit of a disappointment uh we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy	3762	B
and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh	3762	B
uh well Key West was uh just coral rubble	3762	B
and uh we did find Bahia Honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach	3762	B
but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to to go in and and snorkel and and do those sort of things	3762	B
um-hum	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
hum	3762	B
well my uh my wife talks a lot about camping and uh she's taken the girls uh on off to Girl Scout camp a couple of times	3762	B
but my idea of camping is in a either an RV or in a thirty- thirty five foot sailboat	3762	B
right	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that uh was doing a lot of racing	3762	B
and uh and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable	3762	B
um-hum	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America	3762	B
uh it was running about eighty seven dollars a day	3762	B
that's cheaper than a hotel and you add uh oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site	3762	B
and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth	3762	B
we had a uh thirty two footer	3762	B
well it's it's a big truck uh but uh	3762	B
when you get that big a truck the uh the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five	3762	B
so uh i just uh had a change of mind set and i would set the uh autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you	3762	B
and you just stay in the right lane and there's nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it	3762	B
so it's kind of a pleasant way to drive you	3762	B
uh i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one	3762	B
yeah because_1 you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know he's got a colorful car that you recognize and	3762	B
the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich	3762	B
and uh well we enjoyed it uh one of of places we visited was uh Walt Disney World	3762	B
oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook	3791	A
don't like to cook huh	3791	A
make a mean spaghetti huh	3791	A
uh got kids married- married	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
well uh my wife and i we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet	3791	A
uh	3791	A
uh uh yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that	3791	A
let's see a good dinner party menu	3791	A
i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming i guess	3791	A
i don't know	3791	A
uh something light and easy if it was pretty informal- informal about_1 anything	3791	A
roast chicken	3791	A
oh gosh yeah how do you usually cook your deer how do you usually cook your deer	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
i imagine	3791	A
i would imagine it is	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah i understand	3791	A
we just had uh	3791	A
deer stew sort of uh deer- deer steak stew	3791	A
um	3791	A
what was it about	3791	A
a day day and a half in the crock pot um uh some deer steaks	3791	A
in kind of a mushroom gravy	3791	A
um some veggies and a	3791	A
delicious no no the times i've been out deer hunting i- i- i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa	3791	A
i mean i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles	3791	A
so no this- this was given to us by some friends	3791	A
um guy was in a uh	3791	A
in a hunting club	3791	A
and you know but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it's split with the rest with everybody in the group	3791	A
well he wound- they they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit so there's everybody had deer coming out their ears	3791	A
so	3791	A
no	3791	A
we we either crock pot deer or we'll uh you know put it out on the grill so that so that the bulk of the uh tallow will dribble off of it	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah that is good	3791	A
deer spaghetti is real good	3791	A
anyway um	3791	A
no i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have uh	3791	A
sandwiches or	3791	A
something along those lines and then uh	3791	A
um	3791	A
you know just something light finger food sort of something or	3791	A
or maybe have something roasting out on a fire	3791	A
oh well anyway um we don't do much in the way of entertaining but usually it's one other couple come over for a dinner	3791	A
let's see what did we have the last time we had guests over ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf	3791	A
was kind of taco turkey loaf	3791	A
uh it was good	3791	A
uh scalloped potatoes and	3791	A
no it was mashed potatoes mashed potatoes with uh melted- cheese melted over the top of them_1	3791	A
a couple things like that	3791	A
it was pretty good little dinner	3791	A
yeah usually the kind	3791	A
oh don't you hate that	3791	A
yeah i've got a i got a a few pounds to lose myself	3791	A
that's okay i've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah i was- was a left fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade- grade at two	3791	A
none to cook i don't like to cook spaghetti i guess though i make a mean spaghetti	3791	B
yeah	3791	B
no huh-uh just my husband and i and the two dogs so what about yours	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
hm	3791	B

thank you	3791	B
um-hum um-hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
well sometimes we'll have uh we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer	3791	B
huh	3791	B
how do we usually on the grill we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill and it is good	3791	B
real good	3791	B
either that or hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B

um-hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B

uh-huh	3728	B
oh uh-huh	3728	B
yeah	3728	B
um-hum	3728	B
yeah yeah now i also i get it from all over i watch the news every day and i have- we have a news you know we get the newspaper and uh	3728	B
um	3728	B
magazines anything- anything you know i'm i read a lot so i get um you know i'm i'm really up on uh current affairs i get you know	3728	B
the news and and everything	3728	B
um well i'm not getting any- no i'm not getting any news magazines but um	3728	B
you know as- as i said i do	3728	B
uh it's uh it's easy to keep up on current events- you know on certainly- you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day	3728	B
and uh	3728	B
and i don't know you know what what's i mean what what are we supposed to uh	3728	B
compare it to you know i mean the quality uh	3728	B
whatever they tell you you know i uh	3728	B
i guess i'm uh i you know i'm satisfied i mean i uh	3728	B
you- you- you know they're they're supposedly covering everything that happens so you know	3728	B
oh really	3728	B
oh	3728	B
well uh sometimes it's such a you know it's it's so um	3728	B
slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the	3728	B
paper but most of the time- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there uh you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it	3728	B
but um	3728	B
oh well that's what sells papers	3728	B
that's um that's been like that since they the first newspaper you know	3728	B
you know but um	3728	B
i don't know i- i guess i'm satisfied i don't uh	3728	B
i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really we don't get a you know	3728	B
oh yeah i was gonna	3728	B
sure	3728	B
yeah sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad	3728	B
it's all so negative you know	3728	B
but	3728	B
well we have to keep talking i guess	3728	B
oh	3728	B
oh is it really	3728	B
well yeah i don't i don't uh	3728	B
i don't know we're supposed- i guess we're supposed to wait or	3728	B
i don't know	3728	B
cause- i you know like one well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening	3728	B
yeah and it was really we were laughing i mean but you know we don't really do any gardening so like that took like a minute	3728	B
and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean	3728	B
you know i mean some topics really now you know now this topic this is i mean there really isn't much to say after	3728	B
you know you uh you you know you you tell a person what uh news their a	3728	B
you know where their where they find their sources of of information from and then you know if if it's uh if they're satisfied and that's about it really	3728	B
it's hard to talk for five minutes on this	3728	B
so um	3728	B
um no i don't watch much TV sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news but i don't think of that every day even	3728	A
um i think i get most of my current events well i get them from everywhere i sometimes watch TV if i- i guess i watch TV if i haven't read the paper that day we don't get a paper but i work um	3728	A
at a i teach college class and uh there's a the library has a paper and so i often drop in on a break and	3728	A
and read it and then i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home	3728	A
and then i i figure if there's big big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah what's your favorite news do you do you get a news magazine or	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah we've got	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah exactly are you satisfied with the quality of coverage	3728	A
yeah it's kind of hard to know isn't it	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah yeah well i do feel like a little bit like being from California and	3728	A
wanting to hear like i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something and i don't ever hear it in the news here you know it's um	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah yeah	3728	A
yeah i sometimes feel like um the Dallas paper and the Dallas News	3728	A
um the top headlines are always a murder you know and that's because there's a high crime rate yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah yeah i'm sure	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah really	3728	A
that's true we certainly get enough coverage i mean we we-	3728	A
we can get news you know i mean there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day so	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
often times	3728	A
so	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
well no i guess we can end yeah it's just whenever we're	3728	A
um yeah have you always gone until the recording	3728	A
uh-huh oops i guess we're not supposed to	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
oh really it just	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh interesting yeah	3728	A
um-hum	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
um-hum	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah well i guess i can just say i uh it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that	3728	A
well it seems like i don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um you know you'll hear one report and then you'll hear that it you know they didn't um	3728	A
did you hear our topic and it's in regards to discussing homes	3773	A
yeah i'm settled in a place i've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight	3773	A
in it's in Richardson Texas which is North Texas or North Dallas	3773	A
and we've lived in two houses in Richardson we moved here in seventy four and uh changed locations in seventy eight	3773	A
how about_1 yourself	3773	A
yes nice area	3773	A
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or	3773	A
oh boy	3773	A
right- right	3773	A
sure	3773	A
no we're settled and uh	3773	A
we're uh	3773	A
i'm probably older than you i'm fifty two but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year and graduating college so i can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe	3773	A
oh gosh so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere closer closer to our families	3773	A
no i'm from West Virginia but everyone's uh my wife's parents are from the New York New Jersey area	3773	A
so but everyone seems uh has seemed to relocated down that area seems like a nice place to go	3773	A
oh i understand you need very minimum of four and probably five	3773	A
as far	3773	A
right	3773	A
it's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isn't it	3773	A
right	3773	A
matter of looking right	3773	A
lot of people will buy a four- in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had uh there were seven kids in her family	3773	A
oh sure	3773	A
oh i know and it's there's nothing harder than that i always just sort of a	3773	A
assign my wife that chore then i would let her narrow it down to three or four then i'd go look because	3773	A
women seem to like to look a lot more than men do	3773	A
yes	3773	A
why certainly	3773	A
i understand that	3773	A
i'm in the uh sporting goods business i'm a manufacturer's rep i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies	3773	A
who- who are you with	3773	A
uh-huh	3773	A
well great	3773	A
how how was the uh you say- you say you lived in the Denver area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing- housing prices	3773	A
no kidding	3773	A
homes yes sir um-hum	3773	B
what are are you settled in a place	3773	B
right um-hum	3773	B
okay	3773	B
well we uh left here in seventy six uh we were here for a few years then we uh have come back just this summer right now we're looking for housing	3773	B
uh somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area are you familiar that	3773	B
yeah it is the kids are in school here in Duncanville we're in a temporary place right now and uh so they've enjoyed the school so we're kind of trying to stay here but	3773	B
well what the problem we got is that we've got five children	3773	B
and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing so we uh	3773	B
we look at the paper we look at our talk to our realtor and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five are you looking or you settled i mean having- having finished	3773	B
oh great	3773	B
that empty nest syndrome is gonna set in i guess	3773	B
great	3773	B
okay	3773	B
okay you are you from Florida originally	3773	B
yeah	3773	B
oh yeah	3773	B
yeah yeah we've got five and the oldest is uh ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and i think they're gonna be uh with us forever	3773	B
i don't know if that's true but it's sure you know we're- we're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size we're we're trying to find the	3773	B
oh yeah in fact six would be real good my wife and i can share a bedroom and there	3773	B
oh i don't think it's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that yeah	3773	B
oh yeah	3773	B
yeah it is yeah we're- um we're having actually	3773	B
if we find something for uh i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know that's uh but i think the thing's out there it's just a matter of uh	3773	B
you know looking you know finding the right place uh	3773	B
wow	3773	B
oh yeah yeah i think once we get into a place it'll be just fine but um you know it's until then it's uh	3773	B
oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing that's all	3773	B
oh yeah maybe that's the case at least she's got more opinions you know there's uh	3773	B
seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know	3773	B
so what- what kind of business are you in	3773	B
oh yeah great	3773	B
uh we're with an organization called uh Wycliffe Bible Translators it's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing	3773	B
uh it's got an office down here in uh it near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so	3773	B
it	3773	B
right	3773	B
uh we were uh	3773	B
really surprised to find that they're higher here uh	3773	B
when we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not	3773	B
i guess um	3773	B
really prices for housing are just	3773	B
okay uh personal computer- i don't have a personal computer i'd like to have one if i had more money i'd have one	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
is it is it hard to find uh compatible pieces for your the one you have at home	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
oh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month they're coming out with something new and so then you're not compatible- oh yeah	3783	A
uh even with like the computer games Nintendo and that kind of stuff i mean they change it every year and the the previous game or the previous program or whatever isn't compatible	3783	A
oh	3783	A
oh okay	3783	A
well that isn't that doesn't sound too bad	3783	A
um not really not in my work um i did try and take a class um i think last was it last spring	3783	A
no actually it was last fall it was at at i took desktop publishing i just wanted to get sort of a a slight feel for it and it was just an introduction course	3783	A
and it was pretty fascinating we we learned how to do how to make a brochure type thing out out- off- off the computer so it was pretty interesting	3783	A
oh so you've yeah	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
now the Lotus is for mostly numbers and graphs and things like that right yeah	3783	A
i'm not real good with computers at all and that's mainly because i don't use them i wish i did i'd be you know	3783	A
more up on it	3783	A
oh my goodness yes	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
have you heard about the phone that uh believe it's AT and T	3783	A
uh is it AT and T that's coming out with the phone with the like on the Jetsons when you could see the you could see the person's face	3783	A
have you seen that yeah	3783	A
yeah yeah i saw that in a in a magazine recently i was really shocked yeah	3783	A
oh i know hopefully you can	3783	A
have control over whether they can see you or not	3783	A
but it looked pretty nice and it's only gonna be two thousand dollars so which is not bad for something new like that so	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
oh	3783	A
my mother does a lot of work on computers and she taps into computers all over the world she works at at she works at TI and uh	3783	A
yeah uh-huh and uh you know she talks to people through the computer from everywhere so i think i think that's really neat too	3783	A
okay uh-huh	3783	A
maybe she knows my mother because_1 my mother used to work in Plano now she works in uh north Dallas i think so	3783	A
but	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
i visited with some kids in elementary school and nowadays a lot of the schools have computers and the kids are really they're more interested in their schoolwork	3783	A
with the computer you know they can also play games but then they can help them write papers and helps with their math and that kind of thing	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
and there's always something new even if you know even if you think you know everything about the computer there's always one button	3783	A
that you never quite use and you don't really know what it's for and you know it can be fascinating in that way too especially for a kid that you know is just learning so	3783	A
well hopefully i'll be able to get a computer at some point i don't know when but i don't need one right now	3783	A
but there's gonna come a time i'm sure when everybody's gonna have to have one	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
uh-huh i've got one	3783	B
i do have one but it's a kind of an old one that uh they didn't use at work any longer it's not the not the greatest one but uh i use one at work quite a bit all day long in fact	3783	B
yeah because_1 it's a little bit older and uh it's a it's a Wang machine and Wang was you know a leader a while ago but now they're kind of out of it	3783	B
what's that	3783	B
oh yeah constantly- constantly changing	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
most of the uh you know WordPerfect and Lotus and those kinds of programs you can subscribe to an update service for about_1 fifty dollars a year i think they'll give you the the next release of their software	3783	B
and but uh	3783	B
yeah do you use one much	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
sure uh-huh	3783	B
oh	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
yeah oh i'm a CPA and i use it almost all the time for this Lotus program i'll have -well lot of good applications for what i have to do	3783	B
yeah or uh spreadsheets and that type of thing yeah it's	3783	B
huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
oh yeah uh-huh when you have a vision with the sound uh-huh	3783	B
oh really	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
well you know they've got these uh all these modems- uh computers have modems in them_1 now where you can call all over the place uh	3783	B
i can do a fair amount of work from home and tap into our company's main computer system without much trouble	3783	B
uh-huh this is uh how you got signed up for it uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah well i have a sister lives in Plano that's my connection with the project	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
but i you know there are i've got a six year old and i think he's	3783	B
he's got quite a bit of interest in uh in playing around with the one we have at home and it's not a it's not a real fun one it's not a color or i don't have much in the way of game software	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah i think it	3783	B
yeah you know adds a dimension that uh probably makes learning a little bit more fun if you get to you know	3783	B
try things a little different than just the standard pencil and paper and crayons	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
um-hum	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
oh i think that day'll happen i'm hoping and perhaps uh what'll ultimately happen is you won't have to commute as much but you'll be able to do so much from home	3783	B
that uh you know you won't have to be driving around like-	3783	B
well you know there's uh the uh the the the one that's burning in everybody's uh	3744	B
in everybody's mind the uh break up of the Soviet Union and it's a	3744	B
ah it's- it's it's effects here at home	3744	B
i mean it's gonna have effects all over the world and uh	3744	B
course you know i- i expect uh in the next few days when uh the president gives his uh State of the Union address	3744	B
he's got to have to uh	3744	B
pull some uh	3744	B
real drastic changes in what he's doing to to promote some	3744	B
some movement and enthusiasm behind his reelection race	3744	B
yeah	3744	B
yeah well they- they they focused all of their economic capacity on on on their military	3744	B
i mean if they had focused the same capacity in their uh commercial stuff they would've been a lot better off as a society probably uh	3744	B
yes like the Japanese right	3744	B
and	3744	B
um-hum	3744	B
well uh you know five- five years ago could you have- have imagined in your in your your wildest dreams that something as as a change as rapid as this would've occurred	3744	B
it's just you know it it's almost unthinkable but it it is hey in a i i still wonder whether you know that it's going to be stable and then what's going to happen there	3744	B
but i don't think the shelves -is bare anymore	3744	B
i think there's now you know i think all the time there were goods	3744	B
to to be distributed that were being held off	3744	B
and uh	3744	B
you know i- i i think that uh	3744	B
there's still- but but you know the the people don't have a lot of money to pay for them there there's a tremendous uh	3744	B
gap in their ability to to supply themselves uh uh that could create a tremendous amount of political stability- instability in fact they said tonight on the on the radio uh that	3744	B
uh	3744	B
some some leader in in in of- of the parliament in- in Russia is calling for Yeltsin to essentially throw out all of his ministers and replace them	3744	B
because of this- this tremendous supply demand uh type gap that they have there	3744	B
uh	3744	B
i don't know it it's it's	3744	B
-it's hard to imagine managing such a rapid change	3744	B
well and and i think that you know we we stand uh	3744	B
in- in in the possibility of- of in of of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here uh everybody -is is calling for you know this this- this- this	3744	B
uh peace dividend and	3744	B
it the- with- with an election year coming up there's the uh that- there's the the-	3744	B
the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to to	3744	B
appeal to the voters to to- to get elected but you know how how rapidly can they change and how rapid can they move	3744	B
well you got a topic	3744	A
yeah i think- i- i think that's the obvious one isn't it	3744	A
yeah well it it's truly amazing to um see how rapidly um uh the Soviet Union fell apart um uh	3744	A
and it makes me wonder i'm not saying that i'm uh i'm certainly not a hawk necessarily	3744	A
but it makes me wonder i've thought about this if the idea of uh uh the the arms race while granted it has practically- practically bankrupted this country	3744	A
uh perhaps it did bankrupt uh Russia and was you know as a as a way of making a a a political change was certainly preferable to a war	3744	A
right	3744	A
yeah with the right kind of- the Japanese for example	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
well	3744	A
i don't know what we've we've seen so many changes just in the past five years uh it makes me think it reminds me of that book uh Future Shock	3744	A
where the the future is coming at us uh at such an accelerated pace day after day	3744	A
that only the most adaptable are gonna be able to uh survive and and keep from just being overrun by the changes	3744	A
oh no no	3744	A
it really is	3744	A
well and that's just it i i have some	3744	A
i have doubts that uh	3744	A
that it can be ah stable number one you've got uh you know you see on the news	3744	A
the the stories- the stories and the and the sights of these these the Soviet people these Russian people that are standing in line	3744	A
uh for hours on end and have for you know bare shelves at in these hugely you know uh higher prices that they have to pay now that- that government controls are off	3744	A
oh are they are they back- are they have they got some um	3744	A
but they're on the black market	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
hm	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
yeah and i don't- i don't that's just it it's funny- it's inconceivable- inconceivable to me to think that anyone or any entity i don't care	3744	A
what it is could actually manage i mean it would it's kind of like damage control and maybe putting out the biggest fires but i don't think that it's really a manageable uh of set of circumstances	3744	A
well as far as i'm concerned i can change pretty doggone rapidly and i'm all for something radical because i think it's gonna take something radical to turn this country around um	3744	A
well what kind of vacations do you like to take are you	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah where have you gone there	3768	A
um-hum	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah well i've been over there too i even let's see um mostly Germany and France i lived in France for a year and a half so	3768	A
i was able but i loved when i had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of traveling around France i went to Germany because uh i've got relatives there and i just like it there	3768	A
so but um Austria i found really pretty and Switzerland yeah and i i lived in the Alps in France so i	3768	A
anything in the mountains over there i just love	3768	A
then i finally made it to England too um on my way home um so i lived in Africa actually and on my way home from there yeah	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
so um and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from Nairobi you have to fly through um uh Europe on your way home so i went to England and i really liked it there too	3768	A
i know it's true that's the one thing	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah actually now you can get some really good deals flying over but it's once you're there you still have to spend money	3768	A
unless you know people you know	3768	A
uh-huh and- that helps a lot	3768	A
but	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh yeah	3768	A
i haven't i've been i've most of my vacationing in the US has been on the West Coast	3768	A
or this summer i went to Colorado	3768	A
and uh i'd love to go to the East Coast during the fall	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
um-hum	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh i haven't been there anywhere on the East Coast i	3768	A
i think Tennessee's been the furthest east i've been	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah i guess so	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh yeah	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah so the type of vacation you'd like i mean like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week	3768	A
yeah mainly- mainly probably because_1 you wanna see everything and yeah	3768	A
yeah i know how it is	3768	A
well i liked it um i was working in Cameroon Africa and it's not a	3768	A
it's not a place for tourists i mean they're not used to having tourists there so it's you're kind of roughing it but um i liked it i liked it the people there are just very very friendly and	3768	A
um i was working with an organization that does Bible translation	3768	A
so i was doing linguistic work actually traveling around finding out about languages and uh what they call survey work find out where the languages are	3768	A
so i traveled a lot around- around the country and met a lot of people and	3768	A
um	3768	A
yeah i enjoyed it so	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah my cousin came over while i was there and she came to Cameroon then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around	3768	A
you know close to Nairobi in Kenya so she'd always dreamed of doing that too	3768	A
so	3768	A
yeah so is there anyplace you would try to talk me into going to it sounds like we've been to some of the same places but	3768	A
well we've uh we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe so	3768	B
so i i guess those are the types i like we've really enjoyed them we've gone to um Germany Switzerland Austria	3768	B
Ireland and England we've been to Germany twice but um i guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland	3768	B
uh-huh where have you been	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh that's neat	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
oh yeah	3768	B
you lived in Africa oh my goodness wow	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
it's so expensive over there	3768	B
it really is it just it's it's i love to go over there but it's so darn expensive	3768	B
to go over	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
oh i know just	3768	B
right and you can stay with them and yeah yeah	3768	B
you know there's a lot of places in the States that we haven't even gone	3768	B
you know i'd like to go to Hawaii sometime and and uh we- we made it we've we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls so	3768	B
feel like we've accomplished a little bit here	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
the oh the it's oh i've always wanted to go there i've seen pictures and and it looks gorgeous	3768	B
we um we made a trip up the East Coast it was uh in the summer and it really is pretty	3768	B
it's uh both coasts are really pretty	3768	B
but um i love the Carolinas it's just gorgeous over there	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
well you'll just have to plan a vacation sometime	3768	B
and- and- go over there yeah but it's you know there's lots to see here	3768	B
but i just love going over to Europe because_1 it's so their way of life is just so different than ours you know we're so fast paced here and	3768	B
over there you know every time we'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we always have to ask for the check	3768	B
you know they're so leisurely over there and it's kind of nice to to have that	3768	B
well usually a bunch of different places	3768	B
right see as much as you can while you're there	3768	B
yeah how did you like Africa	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
what type of work	3768	B
oh okay	3768	B
oh uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
that's neat	3768	B
i've i've always um i've talked to people who've been to Africa and they	3768	B
and then of course when that movie Out of Africa came out um but i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
yeah that's great	3768	B
um	3768	B
all right	3709	B
um exercise huh	3709	B
um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings i belong to Presidents and uh i've got a routine for every morning of the week and i don't work out on Saturday or Sunday	3709	B
but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training	3709	B
no i i actually i just you know joined on my own and i've been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives	3709	B
but i pretty much uh worked on my own routine	3709	B
they've got the track on the inside and uh i run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i run two miles	3709	B
and then after that i work out with weights	3709	B
uh and i work out with free weights	3709	B
oh uh yeah it's really uh aerobic work out part	3709	B
uh about seven minutes	3709	B
uh no i do yeah that's that's a pretty good pretty good clip and i'll be i'm pretty winded by the time i get done	3709	B
so	3709	B
oh yeah i- i could i could probably go faster but then i'd wear myself out and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else	3709	B
yeah how about_1 you	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
oh i see	3709	B
so just uh just try and keep them_1 uh i guess uh firm and	3709	B
yeah yeah that's true	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
hm	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
oh i see	3709	B
i see	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
oh i see uh so you're in uh in part of a band	3709	B
oh i see i see i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school but it wasn't the trumpet so i was just wondering if that's what it was or something	3709	B
i see	3709	B
so you you have any plans of maybe running- running more when the weather gets nicer	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
um-hum yeah i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh a while back i was more into basketball and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves	3709	B
and uh but it's been a while since i've done that	3709	B
i see	3709	B
right right	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah i- i that's true i've noticed that uh	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
uh-huh	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah huh that's that's interesting though i you know i've been thinking of changing i've done the same routine for almost two years now and i'm thinking it of changing it up	3709	B
uh that's why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine	3709	B
because_1 i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing	3709	B
so i'm looking at changing things a little bit	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah huh	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
they set that up for you	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
and uh what kind of running do you do	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
is it just aerobic or	3709	A
no i mean the running	3709	A
you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less	3709	A
uh-huh and then you wouldn't then you don't get um out of breath	3709	A
oh	3709	A
oh	3709	A
but i mean he's just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
right yeah	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
yeah i- i don't run much any more i did when i was in school i right now i just lift um	3709	A
weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and that's about it	3709	A
and i don't i don't lift any heavy weights uh they're about_1 a third of my body weight	3709	A
yeah and um um i play the trumpet and uh the more	3709	A
upper body strength the easier it is to play you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh	3709	A
and then i- i hurt my neck uh about_1 three years ago so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from	3709	A
um hurting yourself when you play high	3709	A
you have to you have to do it correctly it's you know it's like an exercise in itself but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it	3709	A
um i play at church	3709	A
and	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
well yeah	3709	A
well yeah well the weather's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in Dallas yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesn't that doesn't get it done i- i- i mostly jump rope more you know	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah i- i do a toe lift and squats for that but you know i it it doesn't um	3709	A
it doesn't um	3709	A
accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you're running for a long time they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time	3709	A
and it also builds too much mass if you just you know	3709	A
so and it's like i- i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with	3709	A
and um then it doesn't bother me very much	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
right	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah that's i- i started doing more push ups and it it's helped a lot and then i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out i don't try to push it to the end in one set	3709	A
so i have just about_1 everything at sometime or other	3761	B
oh probably no more than say five at the time	3761	B
well i like uh McCalls Reader's	3761	B
yeah- uh-huh Reader's Digest Redbook um Good uh let's see Good Housekeeping Better Homes and Gardens um and uh-huh	3761	B
uh-huh yeah i- i love to get recipes you know out of the magazine i cut them_1 out put them_1 in a book and yeah	3761	B
oh yeah oh i also um usually get a magazine about travel and um	3761	B
not not really um uh	3761	B
i- i read them_1 and you know get ideas but um i don't travel that much	3761	B
so but i	3761	B
yes it really is yeah and um oh i like the uh beauty tips and you know all that fashion stuff and um	3761	B
no not really i- i just read them a from the magazines that i get i don't really take a fashion magazine or anything	3761	B
oh no just just what's in the regular magazines	3761	B
but uh	3761	B
yeah that's true it's	3761	B
that's uh that's right you sure would oh yeah i you know keep entering these contests taking all of these magazines thinking i'll win that big	3761	B
yeah right oh and there's several others that uh i get through the mail and uh you know they have contests like that not as big as that one but	3761	B
anyway i've always been kind of a sucker i guess for magazines	3761	B
yeah you can yeah that's true um Redbook i've always taken Redbook for years and years and years they used to have a novel in the back	3761	B
yeah but they quit doing that and i sure miss it	3761	B
yeah it's similar to like McCalls or something like that yeah	3761	B
yeah not too much different	3761	B
yes definitely uh-huh yeah but they have some good short stories too	3761	B
and uh but i really miss that novel it used to make- to take me oh say a Sunday afternoon you know i'd crawl up on the couch with my Redbook and read the novel	3761	B
yeah i don't know why they did i never did hear anything at all about it all of a sudden it was just gone	3761	B
yeah they used to be a big magazine and you know they cut the size down and	3761	B
all but uh	3761	B
oh is that right well i can remember yeah seeing Savvy i don't know that i ever subscribed to it but i've seen it you know in	3761	B
well i subscribe to a few magazines on a regular basis how about you	3761	A
oh really they like you	3761	A
really how many how many uh would you say at any given time you tend to subscribe to	3761	A
uh-huh uh-huh what are your favorites	3761	A
we subscribe to that one now too	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
do you like that one	3761	A
i had i had started that one about a year ago thinking that it would be a nice way to get some decorating tips and and more interior kinds of things but um	3761	A
it's really a collection of everything it has got a lot of um	3761	A
home making kinds of things too you know food as well as indoor and outdoor stuff	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
do you use the tips and a suggestions do you do you travel often enough that you are able to to take advantage of it	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
just fun just sort of	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3761	A
the thing i like about magazines is that they are a wonderful diversion for a brief period of time if you feel like you are not in the mood to really sit down with a book for a long time it's it's a perfect short	3761	A
uh	3761	A
attention getter	3761	A
uh-huh uh-huh do you do you have favorite fashion oriented magazines	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
oh uh-huh none that are specifically focused on fashion	3761	A
yeah	3761	A
i have a friend who works for a magazine that's based in France called Elle	3761	A
and and i remember seeing it enough times at her house that	3761	A
i wondered how often people subscribe to those kinds of magazines because_1 you almost have to be in the business to be as intrigued with some of those fashions they're so bizarre	3761	A
we all have to change our wardrobe regularly enough to invest in the magazine	3761	A
Publisher's Clearing House	3761	A
well that's sort of another uh added attraction of those uh contests i guess you could probably enter the contests without getting the magazines but it's not much fun	3761	A
um-hum	3761	A
oh really	3761	A
hm i don't know Redbook very well what what does it tend to be a mix of uh fashion and and recipes and that sort of thing or what what did	3761	A
oh is it uh-huh	3761	A
tend to focus more on women's issues than	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
um-hum um-hum	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
that's interesting i always thought that that was a big enough attraction in a lot of magazines that they i'm surprised that they would get rid of it	3761	A
um-hum	3761	A
um-hum McCalls certainly has changed a lot of over the years	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
i used to get one called Savvy that went out of business or merged or something and	3761	A
since i had only half the subscription through they automatically switched all their readers	3761	A
instead of Savvy got McCalls and that's how i got introduced to it	3761	A
yeah	3761	A
i liked it i thought it was kind of a nice	3761	A
um i guess uh i like to play golf	3746	B
and um i also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts	3746	B
well we live uh pretty close to the Mesquite Golf Course	3746	B
so we'll play either out there or at Firewheel that's usually where we play but i've played you know different courses in in the Dallas area	3746	B
uh both not at the same time	3746	B
now sometimes we ride and sometimes um we pull- we like to to a lot of times just walk for the exercise	3746	B
but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better and i think it's because_1 i don't get as tired	3746	B
yeah	3746	B
i know and that makes me so mad i you know it's like it's not gonna do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently	3746	B
yeah	3746	B
right	3746	B
right well the reason why we play over there is because_1 since we're a Garland resident they give us a special deal where you can get um ten rounds of golf for	3746	B
a hundred dollar yeah a hundred dollars because_1 it's half price what the normal green fees are	3746	B
so that's why we you know play over there because_1 we've got our card	3746	B
oh do you so you live in Garland then	3746	B
okay well we're in south Garland but yeah next time you go um	3746	B
you know check into it they've uh it's just like uh a bus card and they just punch it you know it's got	3746	B
one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you	3746	B
oh okay	3746	B
you must have a a son	3746	B
oh okay	3746	B
yeah oh well that sounds like fun too	3746	B
uh-huh well you need to teach them how to play take them out on the course with you	3746	B
oh yeah well you can teach them_1	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
right right	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
uh-huh right	3746	B
right	3746	B
right	3746	B
yeah i know what you mean	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
oh yeah it's it's just nice to get outdoors and do something	3746	B
well flower gardens i like to have matter fact this past weekend i- i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs	3746	B
so those ought to be coming up around spring time	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
right	3746	B
oh they do great i put mine in probably in November	3746	B
and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later i didn't do anything to them_1 so they're um	3746	B
they're they're good to plant in the winter time	3746	B
because_1 they last for a long time then	3746	B
so if you start putting them_1 you know you can put them_1 out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them_1 because they can't stand the hot weather	3746	B
no they won't make it through the summer because_1 it gets too hot	3746	B
but they'd make it through probably winter and spring	3746	B
so	3746	B
yeah i've got some of those too i love flowers	3746	B
yeah	3746	B
and i do some i try to do some arts and crafts and i love to go the to	3746	B
okay um what kind of hobbies do you have Lori	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
uh-huh where do you play golf or in this area	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
do you uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf	3746	A
i was gonna say that could be difficult	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
i think that might be true	3746	A
i don't like pulling a cart on Firewheel- golf course because_1 they want you to pull the cart on the path	3746	A
that's the reason i don't play over there	3746	A
i like the course but i don't play over there because	3746	A
you they don't uh you know don't allow you to pull a cart	3746	A
and i don't think a cart damages the turf	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
well i guess i could use a car too i live uh very near very close to the Firewheel Golf Course	3746	A
yes i live in northwest Garland right up there near the golf course in fact	3746	A
well in the last two years i haven't played very much golf because i'm involved in Boy Scouts	3746	A
so i have uh i have children i have children Boy Scout age i have two boys that are Boy Scout age and so	3746	A
i'm very active in Boy Scouts so i'd have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby	3746	A
but i -like	3746	A
but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them_1 again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it's gonna probably be six to eight years before they go to college	3746	A
so	3746	A
that's right lessons are expensive though	3746	A
well they probably would never make it then because i don't i think i only took lessons for golf when i was in college	3746	A
ah as a course for P E you know so i could graduate	3746	A
but uh that's the only time i think i've ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual	3746	A
i took one lesson one other time besides that um i just uh try to make the club hit the ball	3746	A
i don't wanna play strike out you know	3746	A
but i have fun doing it some you know have some good shots and some bad shots	3746	A
so you said you work uh in the gardens too do you have ah special flowers	3746	A
my wife had uh	3746	A
just put in a bunch of i wanna say they're pansies	3746	A
she put them_1 in like two months ago because they're winter plants	3746	A
and they just bloom- with all- even with all the cold weather weather we've had they've been blooming just fine	3746	A
that's when she did i think	3746	A
um-hum	3746	A
do they survive longer if you put them_1 in the winter time will they make it through the summer some	3746	A
um-hum	3746	A
well	3746	A
oh that's good	3746	A
oh	3734	B
uh-huh	3734	B
uh-huh	3734	B
yeah uh	3734	B
ah	3734	B
oh me neither	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
yeah same here i don't mind not wearing any makeup	3734	B
um i work at a bakery because_1 i'm a still a a college student um	3734	B
but we we have to wear white pants and um	3734	B
any color T shirt as long as it's not like a bright color like a pastel	3734	B
yeah yeah the bakers wear all white and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back and so	3734	B
Cullentini's	3734	B
yeah it's Italian bakery and uh so	3734	B
i don't mind having having to wear a uniform because_1 i don't have to buy you know	3734	B
yeah isn't that yeah many clothes	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
i know i do that every day for school	3734	B
yeah but i- i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
yeah i know i don't have very many dress clothes but i don't mind i don't need them_1 yet	3734	B
oh really	3734	B
oh	3734	B
oh	3734	B
hum	3734	B
oh wow i love shoes i always buy shoes yeah	3734	B
uh-huh	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
oh	3734	B
i like the look the the like suit look professional like you know look but	3734	B
um i'm gonna be a teacher so i'll probably just wear uh casual clothes maybe skirts and some-	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
yeah that is cute	3734	B
yeah i'm five three and	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
oh really	3734	B
oh	3734	B
i like the like stretch pants the cotton ones they're really comfortable with a baggy sweatshirt	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
oh	3734	B
oh yeah i have a pair of those yeah	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
oh	3734	B
my parents keep the house cold	3734	B
okay uh clothing at work	3734	A
um i work as a news reporter and a lot of i work in a since i work in a small station this is my first job and so	3734	A
i dress very variedly if that's a word um sometimes i'm shooting and doing photography and so i'll be in jeans one day and	3734	A
another day i'll be on camera and so i'll be in a suit and another day	3734	A
i'll come in and i won't know what i'm doing so i'll wear a pant suit in case i have to shoot	3734	A
so it really varies i try to dress very comfortably i don't really like dressing up at all	3734	A
i don't i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that i just i don't know it just it takes too much time out of my day and i don't i don't know	3734	A
yeah i don't mind it at all	3734	A
i	3734	A
um-hum	3734	A
okay	3734	A
white pants in a bakery	3734	A
wow	3734	A
okay	3734	A
what's the name of the bakery	3734	A
oh Italian i guess	3734	A
new clothes and stuff-	3734	A
yeah that's one thing i would like is just to sort of have i'd i really don't like uniforms	3734	A
but just to	3734	A
have something where i don't have to get up and decide what to wear because_1 that just bugs me to death	3734	A
oh	3734	A
oh yeah	3734	A
and sweats and things yeah when i was in school i was sweat monster i mean that's all i had was sweats and when it time to go out i didn't have anything to wear	3734	A
yeah	3734	A
yeah	3734	A
hum	3734	A
i hate shoes	3734	A
i just i don't know my feet bother me and	3734	A
they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just i don't know i wear a size nine	3734	A
and it i don't know it's just the shoes i get i really- either don't like them_1 or they don't fit right and i just wish that i could just go without them_1	3734	A
oh really oh	3734	A
just the opposite	3734	A
but um	3734	A
let's see what else do i wear	3734	A
um if i were in a bigger market when i do get into a bigger market i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and	3734	A
uh where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things and i could then i would be able to dress	3734	A
more business like and things like that but	3734	A
we're all kind of just out of school at this station and so we're all you know	3734	A
still in sweats really so it's pretty fun though	3734	A
um-hum	3734	A
yeah i like	3734	A
yeah	3734	A
um-hum	3734	A
i like this the uh suits with the they come like with a mini type skirt	3734	A
you know and the jacket i like that but	3734	A
but i'm pretty short i'm five four and so that really doesn't flatter me but i think it looks good on taller people	3734	A
are you yeah anytime i go to the store i mean i i have like two pairs of pants because i can never find any that are short enough for me	3734	A
and it's just oh ridiculous pants too i could do without those pants and shoes	3734	A
yeah those are nice those are nice yeah	3734	A
yeah those are nice	3734	A
and	3734	A
tennis shoes my boyfriend's got me these	3734	A

okay_1	3703	A
um we have small children two and four and so we our dining is very limited oh we're past that now we're a little sick of that	3703	A
no um	3703	A
we're more like um you know like Wyatt's Cafeteria	3703	A
yeah that way and the kids just love everything that's there so we're pretty fortunate kind of um buffet style um so you can go in and go out and the food's already served and you don't have to wait and	3703	A
and it's already in front of them when you sit down and things like um Super Salads you know it's again it's buffet and	3703	A
it's already prepared and just things any any eating area that you just don't have to wait uh an extreme amount of time	3703	A
we	3703	A
no	3703	A
we tried a Bennigan's one time and it was terrible course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyways we we waited almost oh forty five minutes before everything was brought out and it was we were ready to go home	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
no we fought with them_1 for forty five minutes	3703	A
yeah so we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more but we do love to eat out and um	3703	A
and we do it as often as we can and and times that we do have baby sitters we we try and catch um some things that we normally wouldn't do yeah	3703	A
oh um let me see uh for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's	3703	A
it's um	3703	A
on Walnut and Greenville	3703	A
it's called Uncle Julio's	3703	A
um basically Mexican food and it's supposed to be very similar to um uh what is that restaurant off of Central it's a	3703	A
um it's a Mexican restaurant off of Central like	3703	A
no but i've heard about it	3703	A

oh really	3703	A
oh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
really and where is that	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
really	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
yeah well my birthday's coming up so	3703	A
i need an excuse	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
oh	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
right yeah i certainly did	3764	B
uh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
well uh uh about the same i dress for school i uh i i'm a graduate- i'm a graduate student so i don't have to worry too much about uh what i wear too much of the time	3764	B
uh which is nice uh uh i've uh although i do uh a lot of i'm a speech pathology major and so i do a lot of clinical work and when i do clinic work then i have to uh uh look my best	3764	B
yeah unfortunately	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
yeah sure	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah yeah uh do- uh do you find that uh on the average do people give uh more credibility or less credibility to a to a professional to professionally- professionally dressed individual	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
oh really	3764	B
even- even the farmers oh wow	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah certainly	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh yeah it depends sure uh so you don't you uh if you had the choice would you wear a tie or no	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
right right	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah that uh	3764	B
that's uh if if you wanted to to uh really get into a hot issue uh well at least in some in some beliefs uh uh how people dress when they go to church is uh is uh sometimes a pretty pretty hot topic	3764	B
uh unfortunately- unfortunately- unfortunately- unfortunately	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh-huh uh yeah i'm i'm a i- i go to the Church of Christ i've been raised in Church of Christ and uh i- i uh	3764	B
too many times you you hear you hear a lot about what- what you're uh supposed you're supposed to look your your Sunday best and uh uh dress in proper attire and uh and sometimes that really disappoints me uh in	3764	B
in uh	3764	B
when i see in other economic areas uh like in Kentucky	3764	B
uh you know people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because_1 they don't have the clothes to wear	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah	3764	B
certainly	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh yeah a little bit uh course in the summer if i can get away with it i wear uh uh a pair of shorts and that's it run around barefoot no shirt or anything uh but uh	3764	B
i guess you heard our conversation- our topic for today was clothing	3764	A
how you dress for work and season to season and everything	3764	A
how do you dress for work	3764	A
sure	3764	A
you bet	3764	A
look professional	3764	A
yeah i understand i'm a i own my own company i'm in the i'm a manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i'm very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt things like that	3764	A
but then when i travel it's a little different situation it's uh suit and sports coat tie and the whole bit because_1 you go to meetings and you're required to look your best and look professional of course	3764	A
yeah i think in today's society uh there's more credibility quite honest	3764	A
i'll always remember i'll tell this real quick story when i graduated college my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty- twenty nine years ago in fact was selling uh agricultural fertilizer	3764	A
i worked for the uh Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and i sold uh you know manure	3764	A
and uh i would go out and call on farmers and	3764	A
i was always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls and so	3764	A
one day i got up and thought well i'll just go casual and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional	3764	A
and uh he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so uh it was sort of was	3764	A
you bet even even back then so i've sort a uh	3764	A
been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best but but here again i dress casual quite a bit so	3764	A
it depends on who you call on in my business if i call on the the JC Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then i wear coat and tie if i call on just uh a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual	3764	A
i call on Oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie so it just it it depends	3764	A
um	3764	A
probably no	3764	A
probably no	3764	A
because uh	3764	A
today i believe you can get away with it but then it depends on who you're calling on who you're it'd be like your your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he'd be missing something although he shouldn't be evaluated on that	3764	A
so it is it's it's just different	3764	A
yes it is	3764	A
i'm uh lightly a Catholic and the people uh that go to my church are you know the Catholics dress very casual you're liable to find	3764	A
people in jeans and and and whatever but yet the way i was raised i'm a converted Catholic the way i was raised i was raised a Baptist and	3764	A
it seems like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time but i guess that has changed also	3764	A
right	3764	A
sure	3764	A
but at the very-	3764	A
that's a very good point i'm from West Virginia so i understand what you're saying there and there it's it's just a very good point	3764	A
but uh you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover	3764	A
and uh evaluation of of an individual of course i think it depends on the type of job responsibility you have i think you have to dress sort of accordingly	3764	A
but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that	3764	A
but what about season to season does i guess your dress changes	3764	A
my voting experience	3788	B
i- i well personally i've been very diligent until recent years	3788	B
when i felt my vote was absolutely	3788	B
kind of washed down the drain	3788	B
for the issues that you know that i felt really strong for um	3788	B
i think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run	3788	B
you really do have to study to get yourself um up to par with	3788	B
what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research and and people today are very busy	3788	B
and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh involved- i know i'm heavenly involved in other things	3788	B
and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i don't have the time to devote to that	3788	B
and uh	3788	B
you hopefully -will find	3788	B
that	3788	B
you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard and unfortunately they are not	3788	B
and uh it's really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in i believe um	3788	B
so i kind of just have taken a back step away and uh	3788	B
hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there	3788	B
take it it- because it is a task that is	3788	B
to me kind of overwhelming	3788	B
yeah	3788	B
yes	3788	B
well i know that when you're in a smaller community i live in Mesquite and uh	3788	B
when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth	3788	B
they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper i mean they	3788	B
they just give it a small portion of the newspaper but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate	3788	B
and uh and then they have they raise a	3788	B
they raise two sides and uh there's a pro and a con side and uh you can really um	3788	B
feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method	3788	B
uh i feel pretty confident about	3788	B
the way it's put forth now i wouldn't say that about the larger cities though and the and the country uh like the presidential	3788	B
uh i mean they've got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted crooks you know i'm sorry but	3788	B
i don't believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf	3788	B
unless they have the Lord that has done that to them_1	3788	B
and uh without the Lord they can't do it	3788	B
and i have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet and although i did go down and register and i that's the first time i've ever done that has- what's been your voting experience	3788	A
well do you feel like uh i mean i	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
uh-huh	3788	A
yes	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
that's really true that's kind of the way that i have felt it i also feel guilty um not	3788	A
knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates course we only have mostly the representation given in the media	3788	A
but um i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known	3788	A
what the issues were and that i because_1 it was a new community	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
it does	3788	A
yeah	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
no	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
no	3788	A
right	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
yes and uh	3788	A
and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and	3788	A
or that and that you don't necessarily your vote doesn't necessarily	3788	A
elect a president	3788	A
right and it's kind of it's awful and and it's hard to feel like one person but i know that it's important	3788	A
and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time and i know that you know people can make a difference but it's hard to	3788	A
to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you're up against	3788	A
and it makes me feel bad that	3788	A
i'm glad i mean i am thankful for the uh nineteenth amendment that it gives women the right to vote and uh	3788	A
i'm glad that that happened	3788	A
and everything and i hope that i will become	3788	A
a better	3788	A
make a better difference in	3788	A
but i haven't done that so far	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
right	3788	A
right right	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
right	3788	A
yeah and it's not very likely i mean it seems like	3788	A
their-	3788	A
uh what is the last home repair that you did	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
oh	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
well uh repaired the back fence it's uh well of course they get old you know after about ten years anyway but uh	3700	A
yeah the the street- the alley's on a kind of a slant	3700	A
and it makes all the fences tilt or or slowly you know	3700	A
yeah somewhat right	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
um had to replace the the ridge row the shingles on the corners of the the roof from all the storms and everything	3700	A
and uh	3700	A
right yeah	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
weather proofing and	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
uh-huh	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
what's uh	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
right	3700	A
and then that it's that it's that white paint i've forgotten what it's called Tight Bond or something like that and those bricks are very porous	3700	A
and it soaks in to those bricks really well and it seals all the water out	3700	A
just a little bit	3700	A
yeah they use it all the time	3700	A
yeah it seals the water out	3700	A
right	3700	A
uh-huh	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
right	3700	A
yeah i'm from Dallas	3700	A
but uh	3700	A
uh-huh	3700	A
right	3700	A
um um-hum	3700	A
yeah and it's set into the earth so	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
right uh-huh	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
oh gosh i'm trying to think well i guess ours have mostly been down at our lake house we built a house- built a house down on Cedar Creek Lake	3700	B
so	3700	B
so we had a shell built and then we did everything else	3700	B
so it was quite a bit of work	3700	B
what have you done	3700	B
oh yeah ours is nineteen years old	3700	B
uh-huh	3700	B
oh do you have to have like a retaining wall or	3700	B
yeah that makes them_1 more difficult we we've just my husband has just um repaired- repaired ours a lot it really needs to be replaced but we haven't done it	3700	B
but uh	3700	B
anyway well have you done anything else	3700	B
um-hum um-hum	3700	B
yeah	3700	B
i haven't	3700	B
done those things and of course	3700	B
you know inside stuff	3700	B
but um	3700	B
now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in	3700	B
wall and you know do the painting and the	3700	B
uh cut and make the like the	3700	B
uh window sills and	3700	B
things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we we did quite a bit	3700	B
uh down there that i had never done or we haven't done that much in our own house	3700	B
yeah yeah uh we do have- still have a problem down there we built us a two story house and the bottom story uh oh it's more like a walk out basement	3700	B
and when- it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think they're called Hadite blocks	3700	B
and uh we found now with some as much rain as we've had the past year it seeps through	3700	B
and uh so now we have bought some uh	3700	B
uh	3700	B
water proofing paint	3700	B
and that's our next project the next time we go down there we've got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it	3700	B
but what they should've done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before they put the dirt back you know when it was built	3700	B
and uh they didn't do that didn't think they'd need to	3700	B
yeah	3700	B
oh have you ever used that anywhere	3700	B
now people up north that have basements i think	3700	B
you and do you know if it if they've had good luck with it	3700	B
we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a store and they say oh well that we don't have anything like that you know	3700	B
and then finally we found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the North	3700	B
and well that's encouraging then because i haven't known that many you know there's just not many basements down here are you from around here	3700	B
oh okay well we're from you know Texas too so	3700	B
uh but i we have a partner in this deal and he's from the North so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space	3700	B
and toward the lake it looks like a two story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a one story house you know	3700	B
uh-huh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know	3700	B
so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money	3700	B
but we always	3700	B
yeah i do i have a like a seven and a half year old dog	3792	B
and he's kind of a big Benji long hair and he's white and he's the baby of the house	3792	B
and tonight he has a friend visiting who's a pit bull so they're kind of running around chewing on things	3792	B
uh we have a child but he's like twenty so he's not like a chip you know like a little kid anymore	3792	B
and uh	3792	B
why well actually we bought him for my son's thirteenth birthday and he's just been with us ever since and uh	3792	B
we spend more on him on his haircuts and medical attention than we do ourselves	3792	B
and that's what pets are like	3792	B
but he's like uh you got to have him when you come home and there's nobody here he's always here and	3792	B
so it's nice nice to have him there	3792	B
what about you how come you don't have a pet	3792	B
um-hum	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
yeah we were talking earlier tonight one of the ladies that's visiting with us tonight	3792	B
her dog is her life	3792	B
but uh yeah	3792	B
oh yeah uh	3792	B
it's just	3792	B
i know our dog takes a nap everyday with my wife and he jumps right up in the bed and the whole bit	3792	B
it's just when we first got him we didn't like dogs around the house or in the house and	3792	B
but now we put up with about anything	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
yeah it it- it's if like now you have to vacuum three or four times a week and it just i we didn't used to have to do that but uh	3792	B
but uh	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
we were kind of timid about it and- because_1 we'd we'd all- we'd all had dogs as kids and lost them_1 or something and and we do- we were afraid to but he kind of rooted his way in	3792	B
and -hey i know at times when he's had emergency problems we're just a nervous wreck	3792	B
so that's that's part of being a pet owner these days	3792	B
and i don't know but cats i don't know you can have a cat in the apartment couldn't you	3792	B
oh	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
um we never had much luck with cats we had some when we lived in New Mexico and coyotes ate them_1 so	3792	B
we were kind of timid about having cats and again plus we we found out that when they were kittens we really liked them_1 and as they got older they kind of ignored us	3792	B
so	3792	B
but with a dog they don't do that	3792	B
when i was a kid i i raised parakeets	3792	B
so those were i always thought those were good pets to have extremely messy but	3792	B
yeah they're- they're fun but i like to look at fish one of our favorite restaurants here in town	3792	B
has a humongous fish tank and i like to go there just uh the food's not that great but a fish tank's wonderful to look at them_1 you know floating around	3792	B
matter fact we got two dogs fighting right now yeah	3792	B
yeah -well there's enough people here actually the pit bull is from Dallas he lives up he lives up there but they're down visiting and	3792	B
so it's kind of unusual to have two dogs in the house	3792	B
well you have do you have any pets	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
hm	3792	A
uh-huh yeah do you have any children or	3792	A
oh okay i see yeah	3792	A
uh-huh so whether um why do you have a dog what uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
yeah uh-huh	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
well mainly because it's just uh at this point in life i've had to be available to travel and we live in an apartment right now so um they're not even allowed here	3792	A
but uh when i was growing up i always had cats and and then um	3792	A
later i guess uh the last few years that i was at home my mother and father got a dog and i learned to really appreciate dogs as well they're totally different types of pets but um	3792	A
i see how dogs are really faithful friends and	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
okay yeah that's true yeah my dad i think uh finds that he really enjoys his dog he says he's the best friend he has but uh	3792	A
i don't know that's kind of sad though	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
um-hum yeah well i've seen that there's there's a lot of um you really have to appreciate their good qualities because there there are problems yeah they leave a lot of hair around and	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah but obviously you find him worth it or you'd get rid of him	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
isn't it-	3792	A
well not this one i it's not allowed here but	3792	A
yeah the thing i like about cats is they're more independent you can leave them and they can take better care of themselves than a dog it seems like you know depends	3792	A
oh wow yeah	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah they'll do that sometimes	3792	A
so	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
oh really uh-huh	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah yeah oh i had goldfish but i didn't think much of those they were they don't have any personality	3792	A
so	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
do you well maybe i better let you go and go solve the conflict there	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
oh really uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah i think that's what's called a moot question	3714	B
yeah the the	3714	B
i think that had we had the war or had we not had the war we'd a had a lot similar uh effect upon the population in terms of the the freedom era as it were	3714	B
i think what we saw was a phenomenon of a large number of young people at one time that were of the age of decision without the maturity to handle it	3714	B
me among them	3714	B
and uh you know Richard Nixon is my hero because he kept me out of that place	3714	B
and my number was six i was going yeah and	3714	B
yeah	3714	B
yeah forget that you're not going	3714	B
well i quit college when uh they when they moved out	3714	B
went into construction	3714	B
took me seventeen years to finish my degree	3714	B
is it was it worth while from who's point of view	3714	B
well i think one of the the major points that a lot of people including myself missed until recently is the fact that	3714	B
we could have annihilated	3714	B
the north had we wanted to	3714	B
well even even at even at the not on the you know the gross tactical but on the on the very minute tactical arena	3714	B
you know they were sending out you know eight or nine guys to engage a company	3714	B
you know and they'd get wiped out you wonder why you know and	3714	B
at every turn the tacticians were denied access to information which is a biggie and uh components you know whatever it took to do the job by the politicians	3714	B
why because somebody was getting rich i found that everywhere you look if you find the money you'll find out why	3714	B
and Dow Chemical had a real good thing going you know Dow Chemical had a photographer at every demonstration	3714	B
yes and if your picture was in that demonstration you didn't get hired by Dow Chemical	3714	B
yeah	3714	B
and uh DuPont was was uh doing a lot of that too	3714	B
yeah	3714	B
well it's a big part of their market	3714	B
you know in the	3714	B
they have no moral conscience	3714	B
and that goes into and it and it's all tied together too i kind of believe that the Vietnam event i'm not gonna call it a war or a police action it was an event	3714	B
that the main	3714	B
push for that was outside the United States our involvement for one thing we were on the wrong side	3714	B
you know we were on the side of the fascist dictator and you know Ho Chi Minh if you've read any of his writings he was a democrat	3714	B
you know he wanted democracy	3714	B
but he was forced to sleep with	3714	B
yeah they they asked us um you know whether we felt the uh the war was was justified in dollars and lives and	3714	A
i mean i- i really can't uh see how it was i think the more interesting part of the question to me was the effect that it had on uh on the US	3714	A
you	3714	A
yeah real- good point but i was thinking- you know i was while i was waiting for a connection i was just thinking about it i said you know the	3714	A
i don't know if without the Vietnam War if we would have had you know all the hippie era the protestors demonstrations um	3714	A
you know and the the effect that it had on Rock and Roll and you know all of the uh the baby boomers i mean i- i think it you know has a profound effect on all of us	3714	A
right	3714	A
right	3714	A
yeah yeah likewise likewise	3714	A
wow	3714	A
oh well see my my uh the the	3714	A
i had uh i had forgot i hadn't even thought about that in a long long time i had two numbers the lowest one i had was like a a sixty eight i think and then another one uh i had like a one thirty seven i think you know	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
well um i don't know it's uh	3714	A
well i think that i think what it showed though was that uh you you know America was was is- is not invincible and all powerful and uh you- you know it it also shows that	3714	A
even with the the kind of money that was thrown into it and the the uh	3714	A
uh armaments uh with the way it was waged which was not an all out war and i guess that's the other thing too it was never a declared war so you you know it never did really have the backing of the people	3714	A
oh and i agree with that but it was uh it was such a uh a a limited uh you know one hand tied behind your back uh	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
right	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
why why was that	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
yeah good point	3714	A
oh really	3714	A
really how interesting	3714	A
yeah DuPont is um they're they're not high on my list of favorites they uh they fought uh the banning of ozone uh or rather um not ozone but uh freon just tooth and nail	3714	A
oh right right but i mean you know they they took uh you know all the data that had been uh produced uh from back uh in the late uh eighties middle mid to late eighties about uh	3714	A
uh how freon was uh shown to to damage the ozone and uh they just you know were adamant that uh you know and- and	3714	A
yeah really	3714	A
hum	3714	A
really	3714	A
any vacations recently that you would highly recommend	3711	A
oh really	3711	A
oh wow	3711	A
wow	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
uh what what has been your favorite trip do you think	3711	A
really better than Europe	3711	A
oh	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
sure	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
yeah	3711	A
well uh i have never been i've been to Canada several times but uh that is about it for me i'm i'm from a Denver and so uh growing up uh we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado	3711	A
uh my family is uh uh real into camping and four wheeling and so um several i- i think maybe uh four summers in a row	3711	A
uh we spent uh our vacation time in the summer uh four wheeling through uh portions of uh the southern half of of Colorado uh and	3711	A
and uh every time uh my mother had uh uh i have two other sisters and my mother had us uh do some studying of the the area which we were going to visit and then we had to write uh	3711	A
uh reports reports about it during during our vacation- which which was really fun it was really fun we we we each got to write little books uh	3711	A
and uh it- it had sparked an interest that uh uh of of mine that uh my fiancee is a is a um very very good photographer that's what she had originally gone to school to do was photography and uh	3711	A
i i'm close to receiving my English degree uh as as well as my my graduate degree so so i uh	3711	A
uh we've thought very seriously of trying to to uh incorporate travel into writing- and and writing a book about uh uh some portion of travel	3711	A
uh so we're hoping soon uh not soon maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over from uh over over to Europe and take a trip from the northern portion of France	3711	A
uh down to the southern tip of Spain uh and follow uh it there's kind of a backward S shape uh	3711	A
trail that the pilgrims use to take uh in in uh back in the medieval times uh to see the relics uh in in Southern Spain and in Italy	3711	A
and so we would like to take pictures of the Gothic uh and Romanesque uh monasteries and uh just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it	3711	A
yeah it would be it's it's our big dream	3711	A
oh sure- really	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
oh	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
wow	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
right	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
oh	3711	A
yeah yeah	3711	A
yeah	3711	A
you said you've been to England several times	3711	A
i wonder have you ever been to a uh a small town uh well it's it's actually about uh thirty minutes from Salisbury it's called uh Bemerton	3711	A
okay	3711	A
oh okay all right yeah i- i- i the reason i'm curious um i uh that's the other place i would like to visit uh most-	3711	A
well	3711	B
that is like my favorite hobby so yeah i travel everywhere and i've been all over Europe and	3711	B
a lot of the United States and Hawaii and	3711	B
so when i can that's what i do	3711	B
well i'm not sure um i guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places	3711	B
yeah	3711	B
well no that's exciting you know i've been several times so after the first time it's like anywhere you know it loses that newness but	3711	B
yeah i love it i love to go over to Europe i do and mostly i've traveled through Germany and Switzerland and	3711	B
we have good friends in England so i've been there quite a bit and i just love it all i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different things are from the way we do them	3711	B
the most interesting part more than the museums and things like that	3711	B
so how about_1 you	3711	B
uh-huh	3711	B
oh no	3711	B
um-hum	3711	B
um-hum	3711	B
um-hum	3711	B
uh-huh	3711	B
boy that would be quite a project	3711	B
yeah	3711	B
well it would be a lot fun you know there's there's good and there's bad and my experience in Italy wasn't my favorite for sure but	3711	B
well i flew into Milan my daughter is uh a twirling champion	3711	B
and she had to perform over there and in Turin and so we had to fly into Milan and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians even if they speak English they don't wanna let you know	3711	B
and they gave us all the wrong directions and there were just two of us at the airport they put us on the wrong bus but finally we saw a policeman he put us on the subway we sat there um	3711	B
and we lucked out and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground i mean it was just it was kind of a nightmare but that was our experience and i guess all of Italy isn't like that	3711	B
but where we were it certainly was and the hotel that we stayed in we stayed with our English friends their team in the hotel and it was beautiful it was very modern	3711	B
but it was very far away on a bus so you know it was it was really uh it was interesting you always learn something	3711	B
and you will always have a fun experience so it it's great you know	3711	B
uh-huh	3711	B
no i haven't huh-uh our friends live like an hour outside of England like Ash around there so um-hum	3711	B
okay have you ever	3725	B
probably once every five years	3725	B
um-hum	3725	B
yeah and the hardest part about getting the family- the stuff together is everyone's spread out all over Timbuktu	3725	B
and you	3725	B
um-hum	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
yeah see that's kind of what happened with ours that's why we hadn't had one in a long time	3725	B
so so to make one successful what- i mean what do y'all do do y'all just start planning real far ahead of time	3725	B
do- you- um do y'all start planning real far ahead of time	3725	B
oh really	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
eat a lot see it's a lot harder for us because we're like i say we're spread out so they have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so everyone can say- um	3725	B
their their vacation time	3725	B
um-hum	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
now is that where you're i mean is	3725	B
but y'all still manage to make them_1	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
you can't really get away	3725	B
well now that we've been talking about it i'm -gonna i'm kind of getting home sick now because_1 it's been over three years since i've been home	3725	B
to see my grandparents or well my my grandfather's the only one that's still around	3725	B
and see my grandmother was the one that used to plan the stuff basically	3725	B
so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it's kind of like she was like the glue so	3725	B
originally um i was born in Missouri	3725	B
so and you know we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana Mississippi	3725	B
um here in Texas so it's harder for everyone to get in get home	3725	B
now- well but see the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters so it's easier for us few stragglers to go home	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
well-	3725	B
well- um how do y'all communicate like to plan it and everything do y'all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we're gonna do it or do y'all like mail out stuff	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
well- um	3725	B
i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i hadn't seen in probably ten over ten years it was like don't you remember me and i'm like no	3725	B
yeah i know	3725	B
do you i mean is that since you- i mean do you have them_1 every year	3725	B
well- see it's probably not that	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
well- i think that's probably why our's always so interesting is because we don't have them_1 that often and then when we do	3725	B
and everyone does finally get together it's like after the you know the just like	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
your family have reunions on any regular basis	3725	A
once every five years	3725	A
yeah um you have a pretty big family	3725	A
oh yeah	3725	A
yeah we've got a pretty big family but most of us live- well i'm well- i'm originally from West Virginia	3725	A
most of the family is right in the West Virginia area- uh what they call the Tristate area uh northern West Virginia Eastern Ohio and Southwestern- Southwestern Pennsylvania	3725	A
most everybody is right in that area	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah they put one together for our family about once every June it was on my grandmother's birthday but she's	3725	A
she's gone now	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
um	3725	A
oh shoot	3725	A
pardon	3725	A
well no there's kind of a set pattern to it there's uh so the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually	3725	A
yeah oh the we get together at the the uh the park uh	3725	A
the uh	3725	A
park and playground area of the church i was raised in	3725	A
and uh	3725	A
everybody brings lots of food and	3725	A
we'll put up a volleyball net	3725	A
just sit around and tell stories and catch up and	3725	A
play volleyball all day and get really fat	3725	A
oh goodness	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
scheduled vacation time	3725	A
yeah we usually just Saturday- Saturday- uh Sunday afternoon	3725	A
or maybe- sometimes it's been like on Saturday afternoon usually it's like Sunday afternoon and most people don't have more than you know a couple hours drive tops to get there and back	3725	A
well where i'm calling from is southern Mississippi so we got a ways- uh uh my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most	3725	A
uh actually we've only made one of them_1 since we got married about four years ago one of the family reunions but we're both in school so it makes it kind of tough	3725	A
they usually they been happening um	3725	A
just after the summer semester starts	3725	A
so usually not we managed to get to one that was before i started to school and she took that summer off	3725	A
but uh	3725	A
oh	3725	A
yeah- oh goodness	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah i understand	3725	A
where is home for you	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah -well maybe this year you can find a more central location	3725	A
oh okay okay the majority of them_1 are still in the Missouri area	3725	A
okay	3725	A
yeah our family right now or most there's- there's- there's only like- few stragglers	3725	A
uh if any with any distance -yeah some of us- -there's one cousin uh in Colorado and	3725	A
uh some cousins over in Phoenix	3725	A
uh i got a sister over in in uh	3725	A
Washington state	3725	A
uh rest of them_1 are within you know a couple hours drive	3725	A
that's pretty much it yeah okay it's gonna be such and such a weekend and uh y'all come that's about it	3725	A
i mean you know this is the standard pattern is the	3725	A
everybody brings their their favorite dish and	3725	A
somebody brings the volleyball net somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon and	3725	A
am i related to you yeah i married your cousin's brother's uncle uh something like that	3725	A
uh yeah they're every year and and still you wind up meeting people you- you- you never knew you were related to let alone	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
down right amazing isn't it	3725	A
um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it	3745	A
um	3745	A
well i that's funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids and um i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools	3745	A
so i know a little bit about it not a whole great deal	3745	A
well um there there's some there's several it's such a a broad	3745	A
you know topic that you- you- you need to boil it down but um one that um	3745	A
i thought was a problem that it's a it i thought it was a serious problem that i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education	3745	A
for um different um minority groups and like Asians and um uh Mexican Americans and and just people in general that speak other languages that	3745	A
sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area and	3745	A
um as the school district i'm not sure how to go about it because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these language and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program	3745	A
and then for just a small amount of time and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the part of the day and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak	3745	A
English	3745	A
and so um a lot of the moneys isn't put into that and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and um	3745	A
you know it- there's only so long you can do that and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts and a lot of the teachers	3745	A
it not- it was not the teacher's fault a lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
oh yeah oh definitely definitely and it and it teaches language too which is really good um	3745	A
uh-huh	3745	A
uh-huh	3745	A
yeah oh definitely yeah	3745	A
right right	3745	A
well i know Richardson school district has a has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where	3745	A
you know of course all the children are tested in some time at portion of the year and and uh	3745	A
some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program and it is just excellent it is i wish that	3745	A
all the children could be exposed to that program	3745	A
you know and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that and yet they don't qualify but unfortunate that they don't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs	3745	A
it is excellent so	3745	A
i have two little ones and that's why i i quit my job uh you know i've been teaching since they were gosh newborns and and it just wasn't adding up and you know	3745	A
being a teacher and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know don't have the time time time time it was kind of getting to me where well i'm doing the same thing	3745	A
and so um you know my children are getting older and i was missing out on a lot so i just decided to stay home for a while i don't know how long as long-	3745	A
all right	3745	B
well what do you think	3745	B
oh	3745	B
well tell me about it what are what are the problems with public education	3745	B
uh-huh	3745	B
uh-huh	3745	B
right	3745	B
um-hum	3745	B
right	3745	B
do you find that those parents um	3745	B
i've seen the same thing and heard the same things and at the same time i've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend	3745	B
you know that that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh the children and and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on and really society sort of dictates that uh	3745	B
you know both the parents work and- and um	3745	B
i know i've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that that would make a lot of difference	3745	B
yeah	3745	B
well i work at a university and and it's really tough when we're uh uh i i uh work at the University of Texas at Dallas and	3745	B
uh we have uh some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen	3745	B
and you know there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class even some who are maybe	3745	B
you know in the top ten uh of their class and their S A T scores are very low and a lot of it has- has to do with their uh	3745	B
their reading ability you know their their language and-	3745	B
it uh makes it tough because when- when you know when they come in with scores that low	3745	B
they may be uh good students but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential and they're gonna fail unless some sort of remedial uh	3745	B
education is given to them so	3745	B
and then it then it comes into well who's supposed to give it to them the colleges and universities or	3745	B
are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and the junior highs	3745	B
yep	3745	B
yeah it sounds like it	3745	B
so how many children do you have at home	3745	B
oh	3745	B
yeah	3745	B
-well that's good what when-	3745	B
yeah i have	3749	B
i went to Western State College in Gunnison Colorado	3749	B
what about you	3749	B
oh okay	3749	B
i personally would recommend the smaller college just because	3749	B
you know you get a lot more	3749	B
individual attention and and you can go speak- talk to your professor and	3749	B
and uh it's just	3749	B
more i think it's more conducive to studying especially if you're like a freshman	3749	B
um-hum	3749	B
right	3749	B
right is that uh is that in the mountains	3749	B
oh great	3749	B
well that's the way that's what Western State was too	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
i wouldn't trade it i wish i could move back	3749	B
i'm tired of the big city that's for sure yeah	3749	B
yeah we're just uh uh out skirts of Dallas	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
did you ski	3749	B
right	3749	B
oh yeah definitely	3749	B
no	3749	B
i regret it too i- i really wanna	3749	B
i'd like to go this year	3749	B
we were supposed to go on a ski trip but that's one that's one thing i would recommend too because_1 you know	3749	B
most college- you go to a college and you make what you what you uh what you can out of it you know	3749	B
and when you get out then you know you're you basically promote yourself and you try and network into a company or or get a job or start a business or whatever	3749	B
but uh you just can't trade the	3749	B
the- the time you know that you spend in the mountains you know if you if you fish and hunt or whatever and ski	3749	B
you know i i'd never give up that	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
right	3749	B
sure	3749	B
right	3749	B
right	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
yeah they do	3749	B
that's right	3749	B
right	3749	B
uh business administration	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
emphasis in finance	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
really	3749	B
i'm at uh company by the name of E Systems we're a defense contractor down here	3749	B
it's it's pretty good company so	3749	B
yeah i'm a scheduling analyst yeah	3749	B
so	3749	B
oh really	3749	B
is there a lot of	3749	B
a lot of companies up there or	3749	B
uh-huh	3749	B
for what reason- how do they do that	3749	B
have you gone to college yourself	3749	A
did you where'd you go	3749	A
oh yeah	3749	A
uh i went- i graduated from ah Weaver State University here at in Ogden	3749	A
yeah so what did you uh or what would you recommend for a good college i guess	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
um-hum	3749	A
yeah i agree with you a hundred percent i Weaver's a pretty small college we have uh about ten thousand to twelve thousand students and	3749	A
i i have some friends who went to Brigham Young University and the the University of Utah that you know they got twenty five thirty thousand people and	3749	A
you know all they are is a number you go to a testing center for everything and you just check in by number or you most- all- most of the time they said they actually even had uh	3749	A
uh student or not student teacher but you know graduate students teaching their classes	3749	A
whereas you know all my professors i knew they were PhD's or whatever and that they were tenured and everything and felt like uh like like you say i got a lot more personal attention and	3749	A
uh yeah we are	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
oh yeah it's beautiful i i'd	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
are you	3749	A
are you close to Dallas or	3749	A
yeah uh we uh in fact my campus was right on uh the benches of the mountains	3749	A
so i was it was really pretty all the time	3749	A
sure enjoy i- i don't know if i could ever move away	3749	A
of course yeah you i- i haven't uh actually the last couple of years i haven't been able to as much because	3749	A
uh out of school but uh	3749	A
i i did a lot when i was in high school and stuff when i -didn't have to spend the time studying and working and supporting a family but	3749	A
i love it you yourself	3749	A
yeah you don't get as much of a chance down there in Texas do you i would think	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
go up to Colorado or	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
um-hum	3749	A
yeah that's true	3749	A
um-hum	3749	A
oh yeah they offer i mean anymore they offer cook there's a you know we have uh we had a mountain climbing class we had you know we had a ski class	3749	A
and there was all kind of that stuff that was offered as you know electives and those were i mean those were the funniest ones i mean	3749	A
that made up for all the English classes or you know the science classes you had to take but uh	3749	A
yeah that was what made it like i say made it worthwhile and	3749	A
at least kept you going to school on a semi regular basis i know it was pretty tough come spring or in summer- or especially when it was so cold man if you didn't have a reason like a ski class you never went	3749	A
it just wasn't worth it so	3749	A
but yeah i uh	3749	A
i'm convinced that after getting me my undergraduate degree i would like to go to a big name school to get my graduate degree but	3749	A
they're so expensive i'm not anymore i i almost think people just require- they require a graduate degree or an undergraduate degree they don't necessarily care where from and you wanna set yourself apart you have to go get that big graduate degree from Harvard or some place like that	3749	A
or else it you know you're just Joe Blow off the street nobody knows but	3749	A
what'd you get your degree in	3749	A
oh did you did you have an emphasis in anything or	3749	A
oh did you that's what i got mine in was in finance yeah so where you're working at now	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
oh really are you an analyst for them_1 or	3749	A
oh really great	3749	A
yeah i'm a little out of my field of what i wanna be i'm an auditor for a credit union but	3749	A
it's not something i wanna do for very long	3749	A
we're kind of the bad guys it's kind of a negative type thing but	3749	A
uh not- not a lot of private	3749	A
ah there i mean there's a lot of companies but they're not really large enough they're mainly there's a lot of family type companies and just small ten fifteen people	3749	A
we uh pretty much are	3749	A
you know the government plays a big part in our economy and	3749	A
well we got we have uh	3749	A
well i was just wondering if you had had any experience with um	3770	A
the care of the elderly	3770	A
uh-huh	3770	A
right	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
well that's nice	3770	A
no	3770	A
it's really sad	3770	A
it's really a sad situation	3770	A
and uh i think a lot of people struggle with	3770	A
uh i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is	3770	A
doesn't always want the in-law living in the house is that right	3770	A
well that's really sad	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
right	3770	A
yes well i know when the	3770	A
i remember being a child and my grandmother had had several- several strokes and things and that we had	3770	A
my parents tried to keep her in the house and they did for a long time i couldn't tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care	3770	A
and just- they couldn't you know keep her in the house anymore and it was really hard on everyone that she had to have you know twenty four hour a day care	3770	A
and i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house	3770	A
and that um they put her there and we all went just constantly until she died	3770	A
but it was very hard on everyone to see	3770	A
well- you know grandmother be like that	3770	A
and i don't know that you know i don't being so young i don't remember why	3770	A
you know what was why she had to go there	3770	A
um-hum well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way and that that they couldn't they found that they could not you know give her	3770	A
the hygienic care and everything that she needed	3770	A
no but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home i do remember the other patients there um	3770	A
being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
right	3770	A
right and i guess that's hard on people to give	3770	A
give up their lives if they're busy they don't you know it's easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes i guess	3770	A
if you can afford them_1	3770	A
but	3770	A
anyway well i'm glad it worked out good for your family	3770	A
yes i have in fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the Lord and we cared for her the last uh oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home	3770	B
aside from uh	3770	B
having to uh take her to the hospital	3770	B
and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital	3770	B
and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program	3770	B
and uh i as far as i'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home	3770	B
because uh she's around her own family- you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family the uh hospice program provides a	3770	B
hospital type bed well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera	3770	B
and it's all taken care of by by uh Medicare uh	3770	B
and uh it it's it's really neat uh and i you know i wouldn't i wouldn't banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse	3770	B
and that's that's what i basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse	3770	B
so that's	3770	B
pardon me	3770	B
uh-huh no	3770	B
oh	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
right	3770	B
yeah i know but uh in this case	3770	B
uh spouse and i uh	3770	B
are uh we're are are are uh united in this area because i guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh	3770	B
her parents	3770	B
uh their- their- their golden years to so	3770	B
this isn't like uh uh	3770	B
just one one uh instance in fact uh her uh	3770	B
uh experiences were were invaluable to me	3770	B
uh in fact i don't know if i could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this this case	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
oh okay	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
well maybe uh uh well as as you say the the care	3770	B
of of grandmother or was was to such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it	3770	B
oh boy yeah	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
uh-huh well then then there's almost then there's	3770	B
almost no no uh	3770	B
uh choice left to her then	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
right	3770	B
in fact just to just to sit and chat with them_1 for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
right	3770	B
and then and	3770	B
oh yeah it did and i was just praised- i just praised the Lord that that we were able to uh	3770	B
have uh	3770	B
uh be	3770	B
yeah right uh well i i think um uh oh	3790	B
i probably um i don't know watching my son's a big fan of uh of Washington	3790	B
and so uh for not- not having any other real real preference i guess	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
huh	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
yeah it's kind of kind of bad when they get blown out like	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
just out of curiosity what uh people up in Utah um who who do who do people generally cheer for who are- who are the close teams out there the California teams	3790	B
um-hum	3790	B
um-hum sure	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	B
right	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	B
hm	3790	B
yeah i mean in in Texas there's there's plenty you know there's a fair amount to choose from between the Cowboys and and the Oilers and so	3790	B
but	3790	B
yeah well	3790	B
um-hum	3790	B
used to be the Cowboys- i mean the Cowboys for- for- for so many years uh ended up	3790	B
essentially dominating or and and being so strong consistently and then the last few years being being just walked all over by everybody i mean they've they've lost a lot of fans	3790	B
i yeah yeah	3790	B
sure	3790	B
yeah they're they're obviously rebuilding quite pretty well and and stuff	3790	B
yeah i i didn't know how he was gonna make the transition into professional ball um	3790	B
you know it's one thing to be a real successful college coach now i i at least i imagine it is um you know and- and then	3790	B
it seem like it would be quite different to to be coaching pros	3790	B
yeah yeah	3790	B
and so uh you know i don't know i mean but it seems like it would you know you can't treat them_1 like they're kids and yet in a lot of senses still a lot of them_1 probably are	3790	B
yeah you would've you would've been one of those coaches with the soft styles yeah	3790	B
my- yeah my dad was actually a football coach so yeah in the junior junior college yeah	3790	B
i played played high school but i didn't didn't go beyond that	3790	B
yeah huh	3790	B
uh well i'm i didn't grow too big myself but	3790	B
a little bit more so yeah because i i'm here in Austin and we have uh UT Austin it's here and and uh	3790	B
you know they they look like they were big- you know they're kind of like the Cowboys i mean for years years had a dominating team then they went through this big long slump and and uh last year it looked like they were back and and there was predictions that they were gonna be a	3790	B
you know it'll be real challenge in fact i think they started ranks like you know fifteenth in the polls or something- and then you know then it was a long slide down it really was it- a fairly disappointing year	3790	B
it yeah it's it's pretty serious uh you know i i end up being so busy that i i don't watch much of it and and i don't follow it much but it's obvious that the people around me do	3790	B
you know and and i sometimes feel bad that i haven't you know i'm not up on it more	3790	B
right	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
right and and supposedly uh uh his brother his younger brother is graduating supposedly his younger brother is supposed to be a lot better than he is yeah	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
no i don't know Texas	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	A
yes go for that -well that's who i kind of thought uh that's who i was gonna kind of cheer for i just	3790	A
think all the teams from the AFC are more or less like the minor leagues for the NFC lately so	3790	A
i just i hope they can give them_1 a game i think it'll be a good game this year but	3790	A
i don't know in the past they haven't been so hot	3790	A
do you uh	3790	A
well i i think a lot of them_1 uh uh kind of like me i i cheer i like players you know certain players and so i root for those teams and Brigham Young University of course is pretty big up here	3790	A
and so a lot of people like the 49ers because_1 Steve Young plays for them uh Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him you know when he played for them but he kind of got to be a jerk so nobody liked him anyway but	3790	A
uh a lot of 49ers i think uh more than anything i guess but uh	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
yep	3790	A
yeah we i i've always been kind of a Cowboys fan i like them i'm glad to see they're doing a little bit better but i- see i just usually root for players that i know of i guess and whatever happens happens so	3790	A
oh yeah	3790	A
oh	3790	A
oh yeah well i think i think you'll see i bet in the nineties they come out and i'll bet they're the team to beat is i mean they got so many first and second round picks again this year that i think they're gonna be really tough and Jimmy Johnson	3790	A
oh yeah that Jimmy Johnson seems to know what he's doing too are you	3790	A
um-hum	3790	A
um-hum	3790	A
oh yeah well you'd think that the just the personalities the people it it it would seem a lot harder to get them_1 motivated i mean it's a job then and you know you're not out for school spirit or whatever you know you're out for the fifty grand	3790	A
yeah that's true	3790	A
yeah that's true i guess	3790	A
oh was he on a college level or junior college oh so did you play at all yourself or	3790	A
uh-huh	3790	A
yeah i stopped growing i think about when i was twelve years old and everybody- else grew up so i quit after Little League because i realized it was	3790	A
i was gonna get pounded on if i kept going so	3790	A
yep but do you follow college much at all either or	3790	A
do you	3790	A
uh-huh	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
uh-huh	3790	A
oh really	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
well i you know what they're i mean football in Texas that's pretty uh it's uh like a rabid thing down there isn't it	3790	A
um-hum	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
yeah in fact that's that was our whole reason for cheering this year because_1 that uh Ty Detmer was from Texas down there and that's that's who i follow quite a bit is BYU but	3790	A
and so we were kind of prejudiced towards him good or bad or whatever anybody thinks but yeah they seem that he just from what he was saying his dad was a coach his brother was into it i mean that just seemed like a lot of people were involved kind of like Indiana and basketball or something	3790	A
oh really that'll be interesting see i know uh he's he been recruited pretty heavily he's not sure if he wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and go to the Y i wouldn't do it if i were him	3790	A
boy if he doesn't live up to that at least his brother's expectations-	3790	A
okay it's pressed are you still there okay	3769	A
so what's uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um	3769	A
um that sounds pretty	3769	A
yeah	3769	A
um-hum well we don't go out to dinner that much either we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that but	3769	A
i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean you know	3769	A
um i've been to some that's been terrible you know you see cockroaches crawling around and	3769	A
everything you know but i try to get one that's nice and clean and then i like to you know good food and good service	3769	A
so	3769	A
yeah right right right	3769	A
so is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um-hum um-hum	3769	A
um	3769	A
um that sounds beautiful	3769	A
um-hum um-hum	3769	A
um-hum um-hum well this is only a little small city um we have uh	3769	A
excuse me	3769	A
i didn't think my coughing would come back	3769	A
anyhow we have only like one uh	3769	A
restaurant that's kind of nice you know they have prime rib on uh weekends	3769	A
and then- then they have a about six miles from here is called a little city called Wesley	3769	A
and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food and the atmosphere there is really really nice	3769	A
so and then if we really want to you know something different then we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away	3769	A
but uh we don't have any fast foods here in this small city	3769	A
do i have kids well i have a son but he's grown up	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
yeah all the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they you know	3769	A
no no i'm sure there isn't	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
i know it's	3769	A
yeah	3769	A
yeah	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
well let's see what else can we talk about	3769	A
oh it's foggy and cold here	3769	A
um-hum um-hum yeah it's	3769	A
i came from Iowa when i was sixteen	3769	A
so i've lived out in California for a long long time yeah i like it real well	3769	A
we used to live in Oakland so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there	3769	A
you know but uh then i quit work and everything and i moved- bought a house i had a condo in Oakland so right in Chinatown so we went to a lots of restaurants and Chinese restaurants	3769	A
and they were really good i really miss them_1	3769	A
you know	3769	A
uh no i really don't miss living there i just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while you know	3769	A
but um as far as missing living there no it's close enough if i wanted to go there to San Francisco for dinner or something why you know	3769	A
an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back but uh	3769	A
have you ever been to California	3769	A
oh really	3769	A
um	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um	3769	A
um-hum um-hum	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
yeah i guess	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
i'm ready	3769	B
oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere	3769	B
just to relax you know because_1 i don't really go out to dinner that much so	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
right	3769	B
oh	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
yeah where you don't feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want and	3769	B
well nearby we're almost in Dallas we're just north of Dallas	3769	B
so we have quite a bit between us and there it's about ten miles	3769	B
and there is all kinds of restaurants and	3769	B
i had one that was a favorite for a long time and then it changed hands and doubled the prices and then it finally went out of business	3769	B
so but it was really nice it had a fireplace and	3769	B
yeah it was really nice they had entertainment sometimes and you- you could just really relax there and enjoy it	3769	B
but it's gone	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
oh that's nice	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
right	3769	B
that's probably very fortunate for you do you have kids	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
you know McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list and i hate these places	3769	B
so uh-huh they do and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have so	3769	B
so we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and it's really it's tempting when you come home from work and you're tired and	3769	B
you know you just are tempted to give in to that and it costs a lot of money to do it too you know it adds up and it's not healthy and	3769	B
i- i really got into that habit for a while but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy	3769	B
so	3769	B
well how's California today	3769	B
is it that's what i've heard yeah	3769	B
yeah have you always lived there	3769	B
oh	3769	B
and you like it	3769	B
yeah we've been	3769	B
oh yeah	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
oh that would be fun	3769	B
yeah do you miss living there	3769	B
no	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
hum	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
oh yeah i- i go all the time	3769	B
yeah well i have a twenty one year old daughter in college there and she um is world champion twirler	3769	B
and her coach is in California so she went there for six years	3769	B
so i went out a lot with her	3769	B
and uh yeah i know California pretty well and i love it	3769	B
and we tug back and forth who's gonna move	3769	B
but i think he's gonna move because i'm the person with more to lose here i have my twelve year old in school	3769	B
and she's happy she's always lived here in the south and i've had my house so	3769	B
i've too much to lose-	3769	B
cooking and foods huh what do you like to cook	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
oh dear	3716	B
oh probably not i have uh a bread recipe that's real easy that everyone always really does like that uh doesn't require kneading the dough	3716	B
and it's oh it is it's wonderful it's and what's funny is that you use uh bran All Bran and it looks like it's a wheat bread but it's actually All Bran and flour and uh	3716	B
you know it's regular types that you know you use and that sort of and you let it rise and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and you can punch it down and then uh make your rolls and they really are good and they're so easy to do	3716	B
that it seems like every time that we have a dinner party or that uh we're going some place where everybody's supposed to bring something and they've had my rolls before they always ask me to bring those rolls	3716	B
no i haven't	3716	B
oh how funny	3716	B
uh-huh well see i i've always used celery- i mean i've used celery before but i've never used the celery seed in it	3716	B
well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
see i've never put bell pepper in tuna fish either	3716	B
isn't that funny	3716	B
i was brought up with tuna fish it was made where you put in uh oh chopped hard boiled eggs which it now with no no with cholesterol	3716	B
and uh you know chopped up uh dill pickles and that sort of thing the standard old tuna fish	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
but isn't that interesting so you you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed i'll have to try that	3716	B
sometimes i do sometimes i use Miracle Whip it depends on what i have and sometimes if i'm using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit i'll use a little bit of mustard with it	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
yeah but not a bunch but enough to make it have a little bit more flavor	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
i like uh barbecue baby back ribs	3716	B
and uh and and they're so easy to do if you uh have a good barbecue sauce and you just cook them_1 very very slowly in the oven and it's not hard to cook like some meals are	3716	B
and it's not of course it's messy to eat that's the disadvantage and uh i make lasagna from scratch and people really like my lasagna and	3716	B
and so um sometimes i'm requested to make that	3716	B
or and that's- and that's not too hard to do because_1 you can do it in advanced and just bake it	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
yeah	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
then i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie it just takes forever but it's uh when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy	3716	B
um um-hum i do but this one is basically it's like a normal pie crust but then you use this sort of uh it's a cream cheese um	3716	B
uh layering but you use thin it out a little bit uh or make it a little fluffier and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that	3716	B
and so it's sort of like in a way uh using cheese cake and you know but but it's not a real cheese cake and then you	3716	B
we could talk about my favorite subject	3716	A
food	3716	A
uh i don't cook a lot actually i've just started baking so i'm kind of interested in cakes and muffins and stuff like that but i can't seem to get them_1 exactly right	3716	A
so just trying to perfect some things i don't know i tried to make an apple sauce cake which i will never ever try to make again	3716	A
it was horrible i don't know if the cake was horrible or if i made it horrible	3716	A
hum	3716	A
oh hey	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
wow um-hum	3716	A
um-hum they request it	3716	A
i haven't gotten any requests yet actually i had a Christmas party at uh my office	3716	A
and i made the tuna fish sandwiches and everyone i mean i'm i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish so that'd be easy for me to make and i can't go wrong with it	3716	A
and so i made it and i used celery seed in my do you use celery seed in your tuna fish	3716	A
uh and i- i just thought it was so strange because i've never i thought that that's what celery seed was for was for tuna fish	3716	A
and so but everyone really really loved the tuna fish and they just couldn't get over the fact that i used celery in it and it just surprised me celery and and onion and	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
oh yeah it's great uh just like um really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed	3716	A
and i used like uh Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because_1 i really don't like mayonnaise- the Helman's mayonnaise	3716	A
but if you use a salad dressing which is kind of uh you know kind of a i guess a tart taste then it comes out really good but i was- uh it was the first time i've	3716	A
i've ever found out that that	3716	A
nobody else used celery seed i feel so silly but	3716	A
yeah i	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
right uh-huh	3716	A
oh	3716	A
right	3716	A
yeah- yeah i would i would put that too i just didn't have those things like i don't think i had eggs that night or something but i would have put eggs i would have put in eggs in there also	3716	A
but that's strange	3716	A
and celery seed	3716	A
do you use a regular mayonnaise or	3716	A
the salad- the Miracle Whip	3716	A
yeah	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
yeah i do that also um-hum just to put a little zing in it or something	3716	A
oh no	3716	A
what-	3716	A
what else do i like i love barbecue anything barbecue i'll eat	3716	A
um um	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
yeah hum	3716	A
yeah	3716	A
yeah i like to make that too i make that once in a while	3716	A
hum	3716	A
it's not really as long as you have all the ingredients it's just the layering really and and not breaking the uh the the uh pasta is the hardest part probably	3716	A
but um yeah	3716	A
um	3716	A
do you make a cheese cake	3716	A
hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um yeah and you just put the strawberries	3716	A
uh -okay uh do you live in a a single family dwelling as they call it	3710	A
okay what sort of house is it	3710	A
-yeah	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
garage is that an actual closed in garage or is that carport type of thing	3710	A
okay	3710	A
never actually be out of the house	3710	A
yeah around here they tell you if it if the advertisement for houses for sale says garage	3710	A
it- it- it could mean anything from a uh part of the house all closed in to a uh uh nice corrugated fiberglass roof kind of hanging in the middle of the yard somewhere	3710	A
-yeah most of them_1 are carports you know they'll be attached to the to the to the house but it'll just be a an extension of roof to over you know one or two parking spaces where	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
now y'all aren't quite getting all that flooding that Texas has been getting have you	3710	A
you're getting part of that uh uh	3710	A
okay	3710	A
um-hum yeah	3710	A
what	3710	A
there's areas that are so bad about flooding that they just don't cover them_1	3710	A
huh	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
you know- come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here	3710	A
which was real confusing when i first moved into this area because_1 it-	3710	A
well actually right now my wife and i are living uh campus housing	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
they're apartment buildings one and two and three bedroom places uh be like you know	3710	A
excuse me	3710	A
like uh twenty five or thirty units per building and then- something like uh	3710	A
twenty five thirty buildings	3710	A
about half of them_1 are	3710	A
one bedroom places	3710	A
there's a pretty good number of two bedroom places and then there's like uh fifteen or twenty three bedroom places	3710	A
but uh oh they're not really too bad they're they're basically cinder block places	3710	A
but uh	3710	A
yeah graduated in in what	3710	A
physics	3710	A
wow sounds like fun	3710	A
i i've got a physics- couple of physics classes facing me this summer- this summer so	3710	A
yeah uh from what i've seen of it i mean you know there's a lot of things that kind of dabble in the edges of physics before you actually get into the class	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
yeah i remember a a teacher in high school saying that uh he enjoyed physics because_1 it it improved his uh his uh pool game	3710	A
uh anyway	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
um well	3710	A
once we get out of school we're hoping to get into the mountains somewhere	3710	A
probably out west um	3710	A
yeah more than likely uh the rainy side of the mountains somewhere	3710	A
but uh um originally i'm from West Virginia in the Appalachian Mountains	3710	A
so uh uh long since fell in love with living in the mountains but it'd probably be like a two story possibly even a three story if we build our own we might even get a little crazy and you know build into the side of a hill	3710	A
and do it- the	3710	A
yeah i uh i'm buying my own home	3710	B
um well it's a one story three bedroom two bath two car garage	3710	B
with a single living area a large single living area	3710	B
yeah	3710	B
no it's a a closed in garage to attached to the house	3710	B
so that i can uh i can leave my home go into the garage get in the car and not get into any weather at all	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh you're kidding that's crazy-	3710	B
to the home uh-huh	3710	B
wow	3710	B
uh-huh most of the time when i had- when i was looking for a house matter of fact the	3710	B
they would tell you if it were a carport or if it were um	3710	B
if it were a detached garage	3710	B
so	3710	B
ah yeah we're getting part of it uh-huh it's um	3710	B
it's really kind of odd we ah we had hoped not to be in too much of it and matter of fact matter of fact in in Texas	3710	B
they have flood plain areas where it's every- about every hundred years the area floods where the insurance companies won't insure you for it	3710	B
like uh	3710	B
like what is i'm trying to think of the name of that park	3710	B
they- yeah they wouldn't cut they will not issue flood insurance	3710	B
and i can i can see where there's some areas in Dallas that are definitely like that	3710	B
but uh	3710	B
oh no huh we have	3710	B
was it what kind of uh home are you in	3710	B
oh okay is it uh apartment style or uh-huh	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh okay	3710	B
gosh	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
three bedroom uh-huh	3710	B
well i was that's kind of what i had envisioned from uh visiting the ones in at North Texas University where my husband just graduated	3710	B
uh physics	3710	B
PhD in physics	3710	B
oh yeah yeah	3710	B
uh actually they're they're very enlightening and they're a lot of fun	3710	B
they are	3710	B
yeah well most everything touches physics one way or another no matter what you do even if nobody tells you that's what it is it's it's physics	3710	B
uh-huh oh yeah mathematics too but	3710	B
uh back to housing what kind of a home would you and your wife look for	3710	B
once uh once you finish schooling	3710	B
oh really	3710	B
uh-huh Oregon- Oregon or Washington	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh that's a beautiful area	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh i see	3710	B
that would probably-	3710	B
uh no actually i'm still single	3730	B
yeah but my mom uh she teaches at a uh child care center	3730	B
yeah uh you've heard of Kinder Care	3730	B
yeah it's a big chain she uh she teaches up in uh up in the Washington area	3730	B
matter of fact it's a pretty big business	3730	B
uh-huh	3730	B
do they have a lot of those up in Utah	3730	B
yeah they're they're growing really really fast i remember uh i- i worked with a bunch of people uh uh for the summer and she was trying and one of the ladies there who drove me there she was trying to put her daughter in child care and it was the the competition is pretty fierce you know	3730	B
uh some places uh charge a lot of money and offer all sorts of amenities	3730	B
some places are like really cheap but uh you know they like have a it's like a home or something an old home they just hire a bunch of people and have a big yard and let the kids play back there	3730	B
yeah and	3730	B
well she was um she was looking for something cheap obviously uh someone to take care of her kid but that at the same time she didn't want you know some people that were like a bunch of teenagers you know	3730	B
just out there working because_1 some people do that they'll just go to high school or something get some kids who work for five dollars an hour and get them_1 out there and that's all they really care about you know	3730	B
but uh some places like uh they have uh they set up a gym you know like a jungle gym and uh they they emphasize like athletics and stuff like that but those kinds of places get pretty expensive and it's really for the yuppies	3730	B
um-hum	3730	B
yeah	3730	B
hum	3730	B
yeah my uh that's that's what uh what my mom you know thinks is the best way to do it you know if you know someone uh who's willing to take care of the person who's willing to take care of the kids that that uh you know that you can trust	3730	B
that's probably the best way to do it because sometimes you know i- i don't know if you saw the thing on uh some news i think on ABC one time they was showing how people the some of the people were just smacking the kids around you know	3730	B
um-hum	3730	B
um	3730	B
um-hum yeah	3730	B
how many kids do you have	3730	B
just one	3730	B
yeah	3730	B
um-hum	3730	B
is it expensive up there	3730	B
yeah it it can get real expensive i remember i worked at a place in Washington called Intelsat	3730	B
and uh the building also house WJLA and they had a it was the child care facility was on one of the floors in the building	3730	B
and uh they would charge i think the rate was eight hundred dollars a month for child care but the convenience was that the kid was in the same building as you were and it was a and	3730	B
oh yeah oh yeah	3730	B
oh yeah but uh the the child care facility was really top notch they had uh the where the kids were was i mean the right above it was an executive uh room for the WJLA right below it was an executive room for WJLA and it's all glass	3730	B
so i mean there's really nothing they couldn't do they could do that uh you know that nobody could see you know so everything was pretty much under uh you know uh supervision	3730	B
and since uh the building was built on a park on park land they had plenty of land to go out and just play around if they wanted to and	3730	B
oh yeah i mean you can go visit your kids during the day you know and see see how they're doing	3730	B
yeah	3730	B
but anyway well i think we got our three minutes	3730	B
hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye bye	3730	B
child care or	3730	A
are you	3730	A
oh does she what	3730	A
yeah i have	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
yeah it is my wife teaches- is teaches at this uh little small family owned one here in Utah but uh	3730	A
i don't know what do you think about it	3730	A
uh they do actually there's quite a few and getting more and more seems like	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
play all day	3730	A
so what was she looking for when she was out around	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
well my wife i mean they they have a prepared you know little school- school type lessons for them_1 and stuff but	3730	A
but the kids sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that that stuff doesn't go over too well she	3730	A
she's not too set on the whole thing i mean it's a job for her she has to take it but	3730	A
uh she's not too she'd rather almost just get a somebody she knows you know personally and have them babysit her you know her kids	3730	A
if she had to	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah yeah her	3730	A
yeah well that was and that was what really kind kind of scared us is because_1 well we we have a daughter and she goes with her but she's in a different class and my wife will poke her head downstairs and she'll see the lady screaming at the kids and stuff and i'm just going wait a minute you know i mean	3730	A
she's a year and half you you know eighteen months old	3730	A
it seems uh i don't know i was pretty	3730	A
i'm not i- i don't like them_1 i think	3730	A
we just have one just a little daughter eighteen months and	3730	A
i said i it's the only reason you know she the only reason we have my wife working is that she can work with her she can go to work with her otherwise it's	3730	A
well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think we're pretty cheap i heard once that like out in Boston it could be upwards of four hundred dollars a month and here you and yeah	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
gee	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
but you know the kind of money you have to make to make that even worthwhile i mean you know to pay eight hundred bucks out of your income	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
oh really	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think that's	3730	A
yeah go have lunch with them_1 and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool	3730	A
but	3730	A
yeah hey well it's been good talking to you	3730	A
all right see you later bye bye	3730	A

um-hum	3735	A
see- it was too pointed	3735	A
so i tore it back apart again and i haven't tried another one	3735	A
no but i bought a little lamb pattern	3735	A
and the material and everything to make it out of but i haven't made it yet	3735	A

my neighbor did it first and i seen her house and i saw how beautiful it looked so then i decided well i was gonna do it	3735	A
and um it turned out really really good	3735	A
uh mostly flowers	3735	A

oh those are wonderful aren't they	3735	B
oh yeah that and that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff it it'd be nice to have that	3735	B
oh that's neat well do you have um uh i guess you're kind of young i was gonna say do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for	3735	B
oh uh-huh	3735	B
oh well well how did you get involved in that	3735	B
you just	3735	B
so you did buy a pattern and then started from there huh	3735	B
uh-huh uh-huh have- have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress yeah i've i did make some clothes for one of those and-	3735	B
dress one of those yeah i have quite a few of them_1 actually in my house i and most of them_1 i have bought um already clothed but i did i did make the dress on one of them_1 i kind of made the pattern up it's not it's probably not the best but i	3735	B
oh it did oh	3735	B
oh	3735	B
you haven't sewn it back up huh	3735	B
uh-huh uh do you do any kind of painting or anything	3735	B
uh-huh	3735	B
oh uh-huh	3735	B
i tried- i tried that i did i i ended up just stenciling a um a blind like a just a roller shade but i i can i had a hard time stenciling for some reason i just couldn't do it	3735	B
and people have told me it's very easy	3735	B
well-	3735	B
what design did you use	3735	B
oh uh-huh and what room	3735	B
have you	3735	B
i guess we're ready to talk	3797	B
well let's talk about air pollution what do you think causes air pollution in Dallas	3797	B
or where are you from maybe you're not in Dallas	3797	B
okay	3797	B
uh	3797	B
well i have some small experience in this area the brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown	3797	B
a lot of that is uh tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish-gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates	3797	B
but uh the one of the major problems that Dallas has is- is oxides and nitrogen that's because of all the equipment that's being operated but at the same time	3797	B
uh because we don't have we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we don't get a lot of particulates now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas	3797	B
uh power plants since	3797	B
many of our local power plants uh are natural gas most of the time	3797	B
uh the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and NOX there's no particulates in natural gas of course	3797	B
and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products we're burning fuel oil and a few other things but gasoline of course now that lead's out at least theoretically	3797	B
uh	3797	B
uh i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur that's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter there's a little sulphur yes	3797	B
and that's uh course hydrogen sulfide which is when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur and you under the right condition you get H2S	3797	B
but anyway uh	3797	B
well i don't know but	3797	B
um-hum	3797	B
Ron- uh Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because of the way the pollution is	3797	B
and when they run rich they they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons	3797	B
and that's another part of the problem	3797	B
the gas is not being burned completely	3797	B
but um	3797	B
if- hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better	3797	B
well i- i guess i not trying to top you but i grew up in Dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of of Central	3797	B
and uh i can remember coming over the hill down there long about um	3797	B
i don't know little bit north of Mockingbird- Mockingbird on up in over those hills	3797	B
and i said i wonder if they'll ever need this road	3797	B
course it was designed for most of us to go about forty five miles an hour because the short on ramps and off ramps but gosh seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet i hopefully the new ones will be a lot better	3797	B
um-hum	3797	B
yeah Ron have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty five i guess towards Waxahachie Hillsborough on down to Austin	3797	B
you hit a point down there about i think where they call Bear Creek exit right just this side of the county line right along in there somewhere suddenly the air feels cleaner	3797	B
have you noticed that	3797	B
well sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing but uh i also travel a little bit and uh	3797	B
i don't know it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier it may be all in my mind	3797	B
how you doing Howard this is a a subject that i'm not real well versed on but	3797	A
okay	3797	A
no okay i'm from the uh i'm from Dallas i'm in Richardson	3797	A
what do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area	3797	A
right	3797	A
right	3797	A
oh really	3797	A
sure	3797	A
well you are you are well versed on the subject i tell you	3797	A
this is not one of my better ones i guess i guess i notice it the most just uh in driving around Dallas with all the	3797	A
the highway equipment that's working on the on six thirty five and seventy five just with the cars in general that's where i see most of it	3797	A
right	3797	A
oh i don't know i've lived here since seventy four Howard and i don't- i think i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here and i think they'll i think they'll be working on them_1 long after my wife and i are gone	3797	A
how-	3797	A
right	3797	A
i understand i sure hope so i tell you you know you get out on the uh interstate highways versus i travel quite a bit and traveling from like Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the	3797	A
pollution created by the automobiles in the in the stalled traffic and the busy highways you know you're at your best and i guess when you're out on the interstate heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no	3797	A
build up of cars and	3797	A
yes	3797	A
i tell you what i- i don't think i really have but i'm going that way Tuesday and i'm going to make it a point to	3797	A
sure	3797	A
oh i know i know going to uh uh i detest going to Houston because it's such a long-	3797	A
do you know about the space program	3753	B
think they keep it that way purposely	3753	B
yeah it's gonna take uh i think it's gonna take a long time before they uh get that space colony out there	3753	B
they uh i remember uh six five six years ago they showed on uh one of the scientific channels you know not Discovery but one of those old ones	3753	B
they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages	3753	B
and it's supposed to be about ten miles long	3753	B
right right well they- they were all gonna be research scientists out there and they were just gonna build it up and make it bigger and bigger	3753	B
and but the initial stage was supposed to be about_1 ten miles long which is i mean huge for i guess for space	3753	B
um	3753	B
no it was more like uh one big long thing it wasn't uh anything circular i've seen a circular pattern too uh but i don't know if uh you know how far along they went with the circular pattern	3753	B
but uh like i say this was a long time ago and uh they this is one big long one that they had planned on and they had thought out how they were gonna uh regenerate the air with plants and stuff and they had a	3753	B
no they had they had thought out they had thought it out only the only thing was it was really really expensive and it was	3753	B
not if you got to think about it was five or six years they said you know by nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight we would actually be able to uh to start launching this thing	3753	B
and they'd have to take several projects to go up there before and add on piece by piece	3753	B
um-hum um-hum	3753	B
right and then they've and once it got big enough they would send more people up once it got established and they got all the systems working	3753	B
yeah pretty fascinating	3753	B
no it was pretty it was- no it was a it was a gravity free environment they uh they had shown- they had shown like at some sort of uh simulation on how it would be up there and they showed people floating around so uh	3753	B
at- at the point- i don't think there was any kind of uh you know gravity control whatsoever	3753	B
uh-huh hm	3753	B
uh-huh	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
hm	3753	B
yeah i can see that	3753	B
oh	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
hm	3753	B
no uh these these people definitely didn't look into any kind of stuff like that they were just talking about the space station itself and how were they gonna put it up there and spend all this money they uh	3753	B
um-hum um-hum	3753	B
uh-huh	3753	B
hm	3753	B
uh-huh yeah uh-huh	3753	B
right right right	3753	B
hm	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
hm	3753	B
hm hm	3753	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3753	B
that's pretty neat hm then i would- i'd mean it makes sense you know i never had thought about it you ever see the uh the EPCOT Center	3753	B
the uh at the EPCOT Center in- in uh i think it's the the AT and T display they show a a bunch of uh future space pods and what life would be like out in space	3753	B
it's it's pretty neat i still think it's a long ways away though	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
yeah yeah	3753	B
um-hum yeah and and i tell you the you know it's expensive	3753	B
uh no no-	3753	B
well actually at this point my understanding of the space program is a little on the limited side um	3753	A
yeah well that's to an extent that's understandable	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
um-hum	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
oh it's supposed to be more of a colony than a than a research lab	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah like a central unit and then everything else kind of rotating out from that	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
oh okay	3753	A
they they had thought that out or hadn't	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah so it was all modular like you send up a small section it'd be liveable for a couple of people and they send up another section and bolt it on and	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah well that sort of thing could work um	3753	A
what did they- did- did- was there any indication what they're going do about uh gravity	3753	A
or were they just gonna let you bob around	3753	A
hm	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
now what what they've started figuring out lately is that gravity or some form of it makes it a whole lot easier to stay up there for long periods	3753	A
some of the uh i i've heard little bits of stuff about some of their things they found out about that was- was it one and a half year stay some Soviet cosmonauts spent up in space	3753	A
and they had some problems digestive tract problems and uh uh minor circulatory- uh little problems but they could eventually become pretty big problems or if people people with with problems to start with that weren't really noticed yet	3753	A
they they could generate into big problems um	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
that's why a lot of the um designs for space stations have been circular	3753	A
so they can get them_1 spinning centrifugal force comes close enough to uh uh simulating gravity that there's very little problem with uh uh {gravityless} uh side effects	3753	A
you know i don't know if you saw it was it two thousand and one that uh that double wheel arrangement	3753	A
that's uh one of the more popular theories	3753	A
they also have them_1 where you got a long central cylinder kind of like a like a cross connection tube and a lot of pods sticking out from that central core kind of like a big pine cone like deal	3753	A
or a bottle brush almost where the pods are all rotating in enough of a a	3753	A
a rotation speed so that the centrifugal force pretty much is one uh is- is equal to earth gravity	3753	A
so	3753	A
no no i've not	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
well actually it needs to be put off for a little while for now just because_1 there's so much money going into it that would be a whole lot better spent on on local problems	3753	A
um the health care and and uh law enforcement uh	3753	A
oh yeah	3753	A
um-hum	3753	A
uh-huh	3753	A
uh the bulk of them_1 probably have aren't even pressurized	3753	A
okay let me tell you i haven't been too many places	3754	B
see now that's where i wanna go that's where i've always wanted to go i've never been there	3754	B
i know ah is it is it um	3754	B
i had an aunt that lived there and she she couldn't stand it anymore she moved out because she said the whole island was taken- you know being taken over by the Japanese	3754	B
yeah and she- and um she also told me that well not her uh necessarily other people that have been there said it's it's too commercialized	3754	B
is it	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
sure	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
oh well i will eventually what- well what is- what's the most uh you know the nicest island	3754	B
Maui i think that's usually what people uh say they didn't they like the best	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
well i have been to California i've been to San Francisco i loved it i absolutely loved it	3754	B
yeah and um	3754	B
oh uh eighty six	3754	B
my sister lives out there my sister lives in Piedmont	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
uh-huh oh well that's right near Piedmont right	3754	B
yeah well yeah that's like a suburb or something what is that oh yeah okay well she lived in Berkeley also and she	3754	B
let's see i went when she	3754	B
was uh living when- well- like when i went out there she was in um	3754	B
now i can't- oh Lafayette she was living in Lafayette	3754	B
and then they moved to Piedmont	3754	B
so i uh i haven't seen uh you know her house in Piedmont but	3754	B
but i love San Francisco i'd like to go back	3754	B
oh yeah went to Alcatraz you know we did the whole bit and then we went to the wine country	3754	B
yeah oh beautiful and uh we went to Carmel you know and we took the eighteen mile drive	3754	B
so then- she- they never got to do that	3754	B
oh i haven't been there either you name it i haven't been there i	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
oh that's nice	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
um-hum	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
well that's nice is is that cruise nicer than it if you just go on a regular you know to a hotel or you know it is now i've heard it is yeah	3754	B
um-hum	3754	B
no huh	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
right yeah	3754	B
oh yes now someone i know was- was on a cruise to Alaska and uh	3754	B
was it Alaska yeah i'm pretty sure that's right my hairdresser she went last year she said she went on a cruise and i'm thinking you know cruise i'm thinking	3754	B
you know and uh that that's uh i'd like to go well Hawaii would- is my uh is my is number one i'd also like to go to Australia have you	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
oh well see i i'm just into the Publisher's Clearing House and the Reader's Digest because we don't uh right now the lottery here	3754	B
okay i pressed the button so	3754	A
you haven't been to too many places	3754	A
okay well i've been to Hawaii	3754	A
oh it's	3754	A
it's beautiful	3754	A
well there is there is a lot of Japanese over there and they're	3754	A
um-hum ooh well yeah there's it's commercialized but there's still a lot of beautiful places to go and see	3754	A
you know uh on all of the islands you know now the island of of Oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands but	3754	A
but it's still beautiful you've got to see it at least once you know	3754	A
so	3754	A
uh i like Maui	3754	A
yeah	3754	A
i mean i like it because the beach is nice and white and you know it's like um Oahu you can go over there lay on the beach and it's really nice	3754	A
where the island of Hawaii you really can't lay on the beach over there you know	3754	A
but um in Kauai it's	3754	A
and i mean their beaches are nice but i don't know just not nice as Maui	3754	A
and then uh have you where have where have you been	3754	A
oh you have	3754	A
oh	3754	A
how long ago	3754	A
hm okay_1	3754	A
oh yeah i know where that's at because_1 i used to live in Oakland	3754	A
so	3754	A
yeah right right	3754	A
yes uh-huh uh-huh	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
oh yeah right	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
yeah did you go in the cable cars and everything yeah isn't that fun	3754	A
oh yeah up by Napa yeah yeah	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
isn't that pretty i love it down there	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
oh what the weather	3754	A
um well i have also been to the Carribean	3754	A
well i've i been there a couple of times	3754	A
i went on a cruise	3754	A
the last time i went i went with my two sisters	3754	A
and it was over Christmas time	3754	A
and we really had a good time	3754	A
well they	3754	A
um had this cruise director dress up like Santa Claus and we went to the beach and they had put a Christmas tree on the beach decorated it up and it was it was a lot of fun	3754	A
so	3754	A
oh yeah	3754	A
yeah because you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know you put your clothes in your room and oh you'll have to go on one	3754	A
no no i mean there was some people did	3754	A
um on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in but that's unusual	3754	A
um one of my sisters got sick but the other one didn't and i didn't	3754	A
you know	3754	A
but um it's really nice and they just they just do so many things for you you know to make you enjoy the trip and everything	3754	A
so you'll have to do that once i wanna go on another one but i wanna go to Alaska	3754	A
um-hum um-hum	3754	A
oh really	3754	A
yeah right	3754	A
oh i i think i would like to too	3754	A
i keep hoping to win the lotto for i can do all these things you know	3754	A
um-hum	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
well i- i think we have a neighborhood watch i think i'm not real we don't get real involved we're never home so um	3774	B
uh well i know they were gonna start one but uh i haven't heard any more since so i don't really know but as far as personally doing something no	3774	B
how about_1 you	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
yeah yeah huh	3774	B
oh i'm sure it is	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
um-hum um-hum	3774	B
uh i would too if i had kids we don't have any we did install a um a uh motion detector light back in our driveway	3774	B
and that was mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on but also we have a boat back there and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief so we thought with that light you know it would	3774	B
maybe keep them from doing something to the boat yeah so	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
yeah yeah that's what it is we live in Coppell and and that's pretty much what it is is you know	3774	B
kids that are bored like you say	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
oh no	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
yeah yeah	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh i know it hm	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
um-hum um-hum	3774	B
yeah yeah huh	3774	B
yeah	3774	B
yeah it is it really is	3774	B
yeah i'm originally from Chicago but i've been in this area in the Louisville area for uh let's see about twenty three years	3774	B
oh definitely in the last few years i think and uh	3774	B
like i say now i don't think necessarily in this area here but	3774	B
just Dallas in general i don't know i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of those things	3774	B
i did you know i wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night in a dark parking lot so	3774	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
huh	3774	B
um-hum um-hum	3774	B
um	3774	B
i don't either	3774	B
yeah hm	3774	B
hm	3774	B
so i've been concerned about crime lately um it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems i wondered if- you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood	3774	A
uh-huh	3774	A
uh-huh	3774	A
no hm	3774	A
well we moved in when we moved in there there wasn't any outside lights and so we've been trying to install some	3774	A
um outside lights and we put up a fence in the backyard mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard you know	3774	A
and i guess most of the crime that i'm concerned about generally is against my- my kids it's scary to send them_1 off down the street a few houses	3774	A
to let them_1 go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything and	3774	A
so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them_1 walk down the street and say call me before you leave and come back and	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
oh no	3774	A
then that's a good thought	3774	A
well we've been real lucky that i don't believe there's been you know much trouble in our neighborhood but it but it does seem there that there is a lot more here in Plano of um just	3774	A
bored teenagers vandalism	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
but	3774	A
yeah and they don't uh i know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their they've parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and	3774	A
a few things like that and course you know i don't know i'm getting scared for the kids to get older because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who and or is it just random	3774	A
crime but um we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime	3774	A
but uh it's really scary to know that you- you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe and	3774	A
but i guess i take a lot of um little bit of um	3774	A
safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or um things that places usually that i wouldn't be going and things i usually wouldn't be involved in	3774	A
and uh there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to but it is scary	3774	A
were you raised in this area	3774	A
hm	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
so has it been getting worse that you've noticed or about the same hm	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
right	3774	A
right	3774	A
take a lot of chances well i noticed that um	3774	A
that uh when we we moved here from Houston not too long ago and so of course we were interested in schools and um	3774	A
but the schools in Houston all have big tall fences around them_1 and they're not really very safe	3774	A
and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all around them_1 and it's just a whole different idea that that at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school	3774	A
and in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school	3774	A
and so that's been something that's been good for the you know in this area that you feel like um you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today and i guess i don't know how people live with that everyday	3774	A
pretty scary	3774	A
but anyway well i guess i won't take up more of your time-	3774	A
well Delphene do you own a P C	3799	B
oh	3799	B
oh really	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
yeah	3799	B
oh	3799	B
wow	3799	B
um-hum	3799	B
with a hard drive uh-huh	3799	B
oh okay well that sounds interesting	3799	B
my husband and i own a PC and i use mine for like keeping our home finances	3799	B
and i also i- i play several games on it	3799	B
and i also was doing some work for my church doing some word processing on it for my church and that was	3799	B
really interesting being able to do that on the computer they were surprised at how much could be done	3799	B
with a PC	3799	B
i imagine if you advertise like in the	3799	B
oh the i guess like The Texan's or if there's another paper up there at at your office	3799	B
you should be able to get some work that way	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
yeah you really you have to be a little more selective	3799	B
you might even want to consider cold calling a couple of places for or checking the newspaper	3799	B
uh	3799	B
there might even be cottage industries now listed in the newspaper because_1 that's what it ends up being a cottage industry	3799	B
um-hum	3799	B
yeah is that what yours is	3799	B
i was thinking that they had recently come out with one that is	3799	B
ah uh-huh	3799	B
yeah	3799	B
yeah	3799	B
um-hum	3799	B
there	3799	B
well they're real inexpensive to get the clones now	3799	B
and i don't know if you watch your sale ads very often	3799	B
but if you do particularly Best Buy	3799	B
and Circuit City i saw a three eighty six hundred and twenty megabyte hard drive with dual floppies and	3799	B
oh gosh the VGA color monitor	3799	B
and it also included quite a few other things i mean pieces of software and a mouse for about two thousand or less	3799	B
and that's a really nice package for about that much money	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
the three and a half floppy	3799	B
those are nicer	3799	B
those i prefer that over the larger floppy	3799	B
they take up it you can get more information on the disk	3799	B
no	3799	B
i don't know what it is i guess because it's harder	3799	B
that you can get more information on it than you can on the larger ones	3799	B
and they're a lot easier to transport because it's harder to to damage them	3799	B
being in the harder plastic case	3799	B
so that's just a something that i've come across	3799	B
well that's mostly- um now that's what we have we don't have a real IBM i don't know of too many people who afford IBM	3799	B
but uh	3799	B
we've had not a minute of trouble out of ours not a minute	3799	B
and i would i would recommend it to other people	3799	B
well yes i do i have a T I P C	3799	A
in fact i have two of them_1 i have i have one that i collected the the uh ports for one at a time	3799	A
like first i bought just the uh the central processing unit and the monitor	3799	A
couple years later i bought a printer and then i needed a a hard drive	3799	A
so uh there was this guy at TI selling a a TI PC for four hundred dollars and it had everything had the works	3799	A
and it had the hard drive and everything	3799	A
so i bought that one instead of buying a hard- hard drive for mine so now i have that one with the hard drive and mine with no the the the other one with no hard drive	3799	A
and what i thought i'd use them_1 for was just to to do some work out of my house for	3799	A
you know people who needed uh word processing and stuff like that	3799	A
um-hum the	3799	A
uh-huh	3799	A
uh-huh	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
yeah i thought i might uh	3799	A
get some extra income somehow or another uh	3799	A
yeah	3799	A
yeah	3799	A
yeah i think i'll I'll i thought about doing that one time in fact i saw somebody else advertise in the Dallasite once	3799	A
and uh thought about putting an ad in the newspaper also but then i might just get too much business	3799	A
but i	3799	A
right	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
well i- i found a uh book once in the library that had sources for um work at home	3799	A
uh	3799	A
you know some of them_1 required that you have a PC but most of those wanted IBM compatibles	3799	A
and as as you know the TI PC is not IBM compatible	3799	A
yeah they do the the um the Business Pro	3799	A
which is that's what i have at work but uh	3799	A
i still have the problem of upgrading mine either to a Business Pro or just going out there and buying a an I B M clone	3799	A
then i'll have three P C's	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
uh-huh and Circuit City	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
well	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
uh-huh i saw um	3799	A
in fact i believe the one i saw was a three eighty six also it only had one one drive though but it had a hard drive	3799	A
you know some of them_1 have the little uh the the small	3799	A
yeah plus the the bigger one	3799	A
um-hum i've never used one of those at all	3799	A
you're kidding	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
oh i didn't- i didn't know that-	3799	A
oh wow	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
well i'm gonna look into getting one of those I B M clones	3799	A
but	3799	A
right	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
you know what i watched a little bit of uh of the Bulls game and i uh had to leave um in fact i- i think the Bulls were ahead when i uh when i left who won the game	3796	B
is that right	3796	B
uh-huh	3796	B
wow they've got the don't they have the best record now	3796	B
yeah	3796	B
wow	3796	B
they they do and they uh you know i think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh	3796	B
of uh uh Michael Jordan really helped them out you know he doesn't have they don't have to rely on him to score every- you know thirty or forty points at every at every game so	3796	B
oh i know i'm yeah i saw the Warriors- i saw the Warriors uh just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors uh Dallas game	3796	B
they look good	3796	B
yeah now i don't uh i haven't kept up with what was going on with uh with the Warriors-	3796	B
uh-huh	3796	B
good move	3796	B
yeah	3796	B
uh i think Boston's in first um	3796	B
i you know i haven't kept up with any of the other uh teams uh i'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know	3796	B
oh man that well yeah but i mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them_1 and uh	3796	B
uh actually actually the the the Dallas area here uh pulls for Dallas uh San Antonio pulls for San Antonio and Houston pulls for for the Rockets	3796	B
they're really i mean not a whole lot you know i mean you find them_1 they're find them_1 be to be pretty loyal uh you know with- with the local teams	3796	B
um you know it's kind of i guess it's kind of like uh there in the Bay area you know you don't find a whole lot of uh uh of Sacramento fans	3796	B
really isn't huh-uh it's you know it's it's about the same uh same distance from here to San- to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento so it's yeah it's not really a local you know	3796	B
um he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio and they i mean they have got a great club you know	3796	B
uh yeah yeah that always makes a big difference so	3796	B
yeah	3796	B
and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really doesn't make the club	3796	B
but it really does you know you get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline of that team	3796	B
once he left you know i mean it's it's just not the same uh it's not the same team there's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for	3796	B
oh yeah	3796	B
who won that Portland game	3796	B
uh	3796	B
uh did you watch the Bulls this morning	3796	A
they won in a squeaker they won by they won by two points uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back in the second half and at the end i think they were	3796	A
uh looked they looked like they were closing it out and then Detroit kept coming back and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and uh i think the Bulls won by two	3796	A
i think they do as a matter of fact one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an NBA record for seventy wins in a season	3796	A
yeah they looked real good and	3796	A
right	3796	A
yeah well they they're they're balancing their attack and i think they look like uh	3796	A
they'll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors	3796	A
i saw the the second half of the game last night and they were impressive	3796	A
Billy Owens looks like he was that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him	3796	A
well they traded away uh	3796	A
Mitch Richmond or is it Tim Hardaway one of the two	3796	A
uh who along with uh Chris Mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the NBA and and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and uh	3796	A
yeah oh yeah he's really worked out well they've got the the Warriors have got a team uh and uh	3796	A
i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the Lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know uh is it Boston in uh first place	3796	A
boy they've had a hard time they said they've lost a lot of squeakers	3796	A
yeah	3796	A
how do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio do you for example like San Antonio uh in Dallas	3796	A
so there isn't much crossover huh you-	3796	A
yeah	3796	A
yeah it's true because San- San Antonio isn't that close to you are they	3796	A
no	3796	A
is it	3796	A
yeah so it's not something you'd drive	3796	A
yeah i was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing	3796	A
they've done a good job i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly	3796	A
yeah i mean that's i think the way it uh i think that's the way it works now in basketball you you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics and	3796	A
well it it's Steve	3796	A
well yeah i	3796	A
well i think you're right and i think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and i think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players and i think i think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be	3796	A
uh considered the likely favorites i don't know who would meet them in the west um i don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so disappointing	3796	A
you know i wasn't i- i didn't- i watched only a few minutes of it and i wasn't paying attention uh so i don't know uh but Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs and	3796	A
what was the last vacation you went on anyway	3755	A
um-hum	3755	A
ooh that's a long trip with four kids in the car	3755	A
yeah uh that sort of a trip can be kind of long just by yourself	3755	A
well that works out	3755	A
uh yeah	3755	A
uh yeah so far the- about_1 as far East as i've gone uh trip about_1 five years ago up to uh Minneapolis uh flew up and then drove back	3755	A
uh well uh the weather was wonderful the roads were fine uh the car i was driving back was a problem it kept wanting to fall apart	3755	A
basically i was bringing it back for the sons of a the lady i was renting from	3755	A
uh because one son living up there owned it wanted it rebuilt uh and- restored and son back here was going to do it but couldn't get loose for a couple few days to go up and get it	3755	A
so	3755	A
oh that was uh in May the weather was wonderful	3755	A
yeah um flew up it was the first time i'd flown and uh flew up just above uh thunderstorms that stretch from Texas at least up into uh the Great Lake area	3755	A
so we're watching	3755	A
oh yeah yeah we got to watch i got- i got to watch uh thunderstorm from the other side for once unique experience yeah the lightning from the top side is a unique experience	3755	A
i always enjoyed watching it from the bottom side but it's even more fun from the top	3755	A
um most of our vacations though have been you know camping trips of one sort or another or just going home to see family	3755	A
i well actually i'm at a pay phone the post office	3755	A
um no i do have one child he's about_1 twelve weeks old twelve and half weeks old now	3755	A
why thank you	3755	A
yeah yeah from looks of things wife and i are both in school	3755	A
the next trip is probably going to be next Christmas uh several of my siblings have decided that it'd been too long since we were home for Christmas	3755	A
uh West Virginia uh that's home for me	3755	A
uh i met her down here so her home town is only about uh an hour and half drive away	3755	A
but uh i'm a thousand miles from home so they're supposed to they're- they're trying to arrange to get us train tickets uh to go up home three of us	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
yep	3755	A
i've been through the northwest corner of Georgia that's been it uh that's pretty much in route between here and home	3755	A
so there's about a nine mile stretch of Interstate fifty nine that cuts through the northwest corner of Georgia	3755	A
but uh	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
kudzu	3755	A
yes this stuff is an absolute white on humanity it seems	3755	A
is it's pretty it it's it when it's genetically engineered	3755	A
that's the that's the southern version of what they've got up north called multiflora rose which is also engineered and it's almost indestructible	3755	A
i mean you about_1 have to expose the	3755	A
you know the first four feet of the soil to you know high levels of radiation to kill it off it- this stuff is incredibly durable	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
yeah its	3755	A
well you see that stuff what eventually take over everything and literally kill off large old trees if it gets the chance	3755	A
so most that states in the Southeast have uh spraying programs where they go in with defoliants and try and kill it off	3755	A
here in in Hattiesburg area no not yet but apparently it moving this direction	3755	A
actually up in the Delta you know four or five hours drive north along the Mississippi River they've got it there too	3755	A
but right now it hasn't really hit the uh the the general area around here place	3755	A
uh one trip i used to be an auto mechanic	3755	A
and one evening i got sent down into let's see Fort Walton Beach with a wrecker to tow a van back for a	3755	A
well we went to California over Christmas	3755	B
so that was nice we traveled by car though and that wasn't real nice because_1 i have four children	3755	B
it surely was	3755	B
well yeah we went to spend Christmas with my my family there and then my um girls are real involved in soccer and so we had a soccer tournament there also but	3755	B
yeah it was real nice the weather weather cooperated and- and it was real pretty there how about_1 you where have have you gone mostly East	3755	B
oh	3755	B
how was the drive back	3755	B
oh that's no good	3755	B
huh	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
what time of the year did you drive	3755	B
yeah i was gonna say the weather probably was real pretty then	3755	B
yeah they have some whopper of thunderstorms out on these plains	3755	B
lots of lightning	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
huh now	3755	B
and now i hear that you have children in the background	3755	B
oh	3755	B
oh congratulations you'll be taking him on some of trips then i guess	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
now where's home	3755	B
oh	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
huh	3755	B
oh	3755	B
like an Amtrak	3755	B
huh have you been to Georgia	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
well we went there last summer again for a soccer tournament and it was just beautiful there	3755	B
they have some kind of vine there that grows up and down and up and down trees	3755	B
yes that was it	3755	B
yeah but it's so pretty	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
huh	3755	B
yeah see i kept talking about_1 how beautiful it was and the natives there just would roll their eyes like you're crazy this is awful stuff but i -remember calling home and saying it's too pretty here all i'm staying forever	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
oh	3755	B
so do you have that there	3755	B
and me yeah	3755	B
uh-huh	3755	B
yeah so what about South have you been to Florida	3755	B
uh-huh	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
so what kind of hobbies you have	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
hm	3742	A
signatures like uh like important people i guess	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
hm that's pretty neat yeah most of my hobbies are uh i guess i uh i like cars i work on i like to work on my car and uh yes since i have an old car	3742	A
i have a i have a Honda it's an eighty three Honda this car's not too bad i don't have to work on it as much but i've before this i had a Toyota Corona i don't know if you ever heard of those cars but uh	3742	A
i had the car it's an eighty one Toyota Corona i must've worked on it like every third day i had it i had a i had a problem with the uh with the radiator	3742	A
uh the car basically would overheat i mean i i lived- used to live in Washington DC and didn't have any problems when i lived up there but soon as i came down here the heat was must must've been too intense for the car so the car kept overheating and turned out it was some kind of a problem with the radiator	3742	A
so i had the radiator replaced and they did everything they could possibly do they said there was some kind of problem they just couldn't figure out what it was	3742	A
and the Toyota dealer couldn't figure it out the radiator place couldn't figure it out so basically i had to keep adding water to the radiator every uh every couple days	3742	A
you know and what you had to do is you had to start it up let it get hot let it suck the radiator fluid into the engine then add more water to it then shut it and then you could run another three days	3742	A
oh yeah let me tell you i mean it's it was bad when it was in the winter time you had to do this too you know	3742	A
so uh	3742	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3742	A
no huh-uh	3742	A
oh is it like a mini car	3742	A
my my parents' next door neighbor have one of those	3742	A
they uh it um i think his wife won it in some kind of contest and he just uh it looks almost like a fake car because_1 it's so small it's you know and it's it's in perfect shape	3742	A
yeah really but uh it's it's really a neat looking car though and uh	3742	A
yeah	3742	A
um-hum um-hum um that's kind of kind of cool	3742	A
and the other hobby i have is uh i guess i play uh like the racket sports you know racquetball and tennis and i love to play that	3742	A
yeah um-hum	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
um-hum	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
well what i did was i played tennis for a long time then hadn't played for a long time then i started playing racquetball again	3742	A
and uh when i got really good at racquetball then i waited a while and i went back to tennis and so now when i'm back to either one of the sports you know since i since the gap was so far apart between the two i think that i get back to tennis soon as i pick up a tennis racket i'm i'm back into the swing	3742	A
and soon as i pick up a racquetball racket i'm back- it takes me a little while to to get as good you know uh i usually need you know at least a good hour warm-up before i'm i'm back into the swing	3742	A
but uh once i'm back in it you know it's pretty good	3742	A
oh yeah that's definite yeah you don't- it i have to really think about the uh the ceiling shots and the side wall shots you know	3742	A
uh and that's probably it probably puts more pressure on my brain than it does in my on my body	3742	A
it's a great sport see it's aerobic and uh and if you play with someone uh you got to play with someone who's as good as you are you know not better or not- and not worse	3742	A
because_1 if you play- i used to play with uh my roommate and uh from college and we uh we were both about the same as far as you know how good we both were you know and we'd have volleys that would last five or six minutes you know	3742	A
so it's it's a great sport great aerobic sport	3742	A
well the only reason i like it better than tennis is i used to play tennis with my dad and he plays uh old man tennis you know	3742	A
he could hit puts underspin on the ball all the time and he can hit every ball okay but he doesn't hit it hard he just hits it really lightly you know makes you run all over the place	3742	A
and it just kind of drives me up the wall	3742	A
well the primary thing that i do uh is go around and uh collect uh collectibles that are purchase collectibles and uh and some antiques uh go to a lot of garage sales and estate sales	3742	B
and collect signatures	3742	B
uh yeah uh -important people um oh some are just uh sports fans	3742	B
uh i had- i land like aviation so i've got a number of them_1 from uh uh like the Wright brothers uh uh Chuck Yeager um Charles Lindburgh things like that	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh do you	3742	B
what do you have	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
sure	3742	B
um-hum	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh jeez	3742	B
well that sounds like fun	3742	B
hm	3742	B
yeah oh yeah	3742	B
no as a matter of fact i've been uh seriously considering uh restoring a car	3742	B
um i was looking at a Nash Metropolitan	3742	B
i don't know if you know what those are	3742	B
uh they're little two tone uh cars that came out in	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
fifty-	3742	B
really	3742	B
huh	3742	B
yeah yeah	3742	B
does he wanna sell it	3742	B
oh	3742	B
yeah now i'm i've been trying to find one that's uh uh i was- i was looking at getting one of those and trying to restore it	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh	3742	B
both of them_1	3742	B
because_1 most of the folks that i found and i i used to play a lot of tennis then when i started playing racquetball uh by the time i finally got a swing down for racquetball i i found out i couldn't play tennis anymore	3742	B
uh-huh	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh good	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
well it's tough to do those ceiling shots on a tennis court	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
i tell you i really like uh racquetball	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
um-hum	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
i like it better than uh tennis just because i don't have to go so far to get the ball	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
uh-huh so who-	3742	B
um are you from this area	3736	B
well i don't know if you know but Garland has got a real big recycling center	3736	B
that in fact we went to yesterday you drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like	3736	B
clear glass and colored glass and plastics and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom	3736	B
that's pretty neat my my daughter is four and she's real interested in recycling so we're we're trying to promote that because_1 she thought we just put them_1 in a special trash can and threw them_1 away but	3736	B
we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them	3736	B
uh does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet	3736	B
oh okay	3736	B
yeah	3736	B
hum	3736	B
yeah um like soda bottles are one kind- one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic you can tell- it's got- it'll	3736	B
most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three	3736	B
it's it's just different kind of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic know that's what the different types are	3736	B
yeah	3736	B
yeah yes i i know there's a long scientific name but it's like {polytechnochloride} and all that fun stuff um i like	3736	B
i don't know if if they do it all over but our Kroger does a a newspaper recycling every Saturday you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there	3736	B
um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car and they'll put it in their little bin	3736	B
and they do the recycling i mean they collect the newspapers and their plastic- the plastic grocery bags	3736	B
which i think is pretty neat that's something since we all have- seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags i know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things	3736	B
yeah yeah in fact i have one today it's um-hum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom	3736	B
and it's like whoops there goes my chips okay fine	3736	B
now i in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night	3736	B
they did a program or the one of their articles was on recycling and or it was actually on a a town that has a dump that	3736	B
they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there they have made so much money from that	3736	B
that they built they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so they bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill	3736	B
they have built up one mountain they call it Mount Trashmore they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it	3736	B
so the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that it's like that's it's a it's Riverview Ohio or some place up there	3736	B
but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than Dallas' and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city	3736	B
okay	3736	B
but i thought that was pretty neat it it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and	3736	B
yeah see that's well they're already planning a second mountain so they're gonna get going to be called the Twin Peaks i was like uh-huh go back to the TV shows	3736	B
this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling	3736	B
oh it's we i know like i said i've got a two year old and a four year old and that's	3736	B
my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled so it's like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her	3736	B
what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them_1 into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and	3736	B
well yeah she- that was the her next question was how do you grow paper	3736	B
was like well from trees um that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees	3736	B
you crunch it up real small and then you melt it down well what if it breaks well okay it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her	3736	B
but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about so i guess what-	3736	B
i'm from Dallas yeah	3736	A
okay	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
um well i don't know if Dallas is Richardson does	3736	A
um they started with newspapers and uh of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic	3736	A
i didn't know there were different types of plastic though	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
oh	3736	A
oh okay-	3736	A
yeah it seems to be made out of something different	3736	A
uh	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
yeah	3736	A
hum	3736	A
that's right yeah	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
lunch bags and	3736	A
right-	3736	A
yeah they didn't	3736	A
yeah um-hum	3736	A
uh no	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
oh	3736	A
yeah	3736	A
wow	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
hum	3736	A
yeah they'll run out of space before long	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
right	3736	A
right yeah	3736	A
they don't even know that paper comes from trees yet so	3736	A
how do you grow paper	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
and how do you grow aluminum	3736	A
um	3736	A
right	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
wood working do you do much in the way of wood working	3706	A
i'm in about the same condition um had access to a fair amount of my father's place before i	3706	A
moved away but uh it's been several years ago	3706	A
but i've always always enjoyed what chances i had to do wood working	3706	A
framing like picture framing	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
oh okay yeah okay well it was	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
yeah my	3706	A
right now what i've got in the way of wood working tools is a circular saw and a uh square	3706	A
that's it well a drill i do have a drill	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
i don't know the wood working projects i've been involved with lately we uh	3706	A
converted a uh a very large section of shelving from an a restaurant that went belly up into a small smaller set for the home it something for my text books and my computer to stand on	3706	A
um no	3706	A
ooh	3706	A
um-hum	3706	A
it's smooth faced doors	3706	A
these are like smooth faced doors	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
it would	3706	A
that would make a good table top	3706	A
oh the fellow with the beard that's hooked up with Sears now	3706	A
Villa or something like	3706	A
{doohinkey}	3706	A
New Yankee Workshop	3706	A
oh okay it's a series though	3706	A
huh	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
oh yeah he's got a he's got the sort of thing that that uh you know a professional shop would envy- envy more than likely	3706	A
if i had yes	3706	A
yeah well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do but it just takes more time and and a lot more talent when you have you got limited resources	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
oh yeah it's expensive stuff and	3706	A
last piece of hard wood that i bought was uh let's see a a one by ten by	3706	A
one- one inch by ten inch by four foot piece of uh	3706	A
of walnut	3706	A
oh beautiful piece of walnut	3706	A
and now- now for the life of me i don't know what i did with that board	3706	A
i carried it around i- i got it all sanded out and planed out and never did get done with what ever it was i'd originally planned to do with it and i think i wound up giving it to my little brother	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
anyway	3706	A
um-hum	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
i've	3706	A
well- it's one night a week and i think it's something you'd probably really enjoy	3706	A
i don't know i was uh thirty three and i and just started college	3706	A
and i mean going into it was like oh it sounds you know like it'd be fun but and i had all kinds of little buts that never really amounted to much but	3706	A
you know when i finally got into it i was so glad i did	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
yeah it it it's i mean hobbies like that are therapeutic too	3706	A
not a terrific amount to be honest with you uh	3706	B
i really don't have much in the way of tools i'd like to get a router and uh some other things like that but i really don't have much how about_1 yourself	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
you know i've made a just some simple things here just some shelves and uh	3706	B
saw horses you know nothing real complicated did a little bit of framing when i was going to you know in high school	3706	B
right yeah no uh uh home framing i guess that's not wood working that's construction i guess but in high school shop you know like every body had to build a couple of things and i really liked it i thought it was a lot of fun	3706	B
but you do need the tools i don't have much in the way of tools to be honest i don't have a table saw or a drill press or any of that kind of stuff	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
no i've got a drill and i think i got a jig saw and i got a a circular saw but	3706	B
oh	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
well that's kind of similar to what i've done uh had a father-in-law that got a bunch of uh uh real nice heavy doors from a motel that went out of business	3706	B
and uh they made a great table top so i made a nice work bench with a peg board back on it and	3706	B
pardon me	3706	B
yeah they're solid core and uh they they made a real terrific uh table top for a for a work bench there	3706	B
so you know it's real steady and	3706	B
well it's you know i watch this guy on TV once in a while	3706	B
is it the New Yankee oh no no it's this other guy it's called the New Yankee uh Workshop i don't know if you've ever seen him or not	3706	B
new Yankee- New Yankee	3706	B
i think that's what it's called but he makes uh mostly furniture items you know he'll make a a mirror or a chest of drawers or a table	3706	B
and uh it's fascinating to watch him work you know he does a terrific job but he's got every single thing you can imagine you know	3706	B
yeah yeah he's he's got all the all those things you'd like and	3706	B
and uh	3706	B
that's the problem i watch him do those things and i say you know i probably could do that given a little bit of experience yeah	3706	B
if i had five or ten thousand dollars in equipment like i'm sure he has	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
that- that's true you have to be better than than he is and that's hard to do what gets makes you a little nervous when you you know you're on a real nice piece of hard wood you don't wanna mess up on it	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
so	3706	B
um-hum	3706	B
oh	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
oh	3706	B
is that right	3706	B
well i've been tempted once in a while to uh i don't know you have these uh community education programs	3706	B
where you're adult education you can you can take a class in the evenings where you go at the local high school or the community college and sign up for a wood working class i've been tempted to do that	3706	B
i have some a friend that made a microwave stand and some you know some other kinds of things like that did a nice job and then you know then you can use their stuff	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
yeah well well that's the one hobby i'd like to develop more i'll be honest with you uh	3706	B
it'd be	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
do you know you know what the topic is	3722	B
right	3722	B
i like uh pretty much rock popular rock	3722	B
what kind do you like	3722	B
um-hum um-hum	3722	B
um i can get into soft jazz too	3722	B
no	3722	B
country turns me off uh the my my girlfriend likes rap	3722	B
i don't like	3722	B
yeah definitely strange but uh i- i never got much i mean every so often there is like a song out that just sounds funny when you listen to it and those are probably the only kind i like but uh rap in general like i don't get into	3722	B
um i- i actually have a couple of favorite artists i- i like guys like you know Billy Joel uh who are singers song writers you know i mean who are	3722	B
yeah he's i- i love him i- i had his greatest hits uh and i had to have it on i have it on tape i have it on CD and i have it on record	3722	B
my tape went bad so i bought a record then my record went bad so i bought a CD	3722	B
probably Piano Man	3722	B
yeah i uh maybe- maybe just because it is like on i think it is the first one on the on the CD	3722	B
and it's the first one on the tape too and i just listen to it a lot and i just i just love it	3722	B
hm that is a good one	3722	B
you ever see the video uh by Billy Joel uh it's not it's uh another one about uh he is in a courtroom and he has you something like Keeping the Faith that's the name of the song and in the video he uh he's actually in court	3722	B
and and uh Christi Brinkley's in it yeah that's another reason i like him he's like married to the girl i love you know	3722	B
uh-huh	3722	B
right right	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
and i just got a kick out of it it was just really funny	3722	B
uh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah he	3722	B
he he just has the ability i mean every so often he'll just come out with uh you know a couple of the songs that are just great yeah	3722	B
no i haven't heard anything lately um but then again i haven't bought any CDs lately i had a CD player and i just moved from Washington about two years ago and uh when i was in Washington in DC i- i gave my CD player to my sister because_1 i was going to buy another one	3722	B
and and well i have one now but i just got it it's like two months ago so i- i just uh recently have started going back into the CD market	3722	B
yeah i got the the five disc carousel	3722	B
oh yeah	3722	B
um-hum um-hum	3722	B
oh yeah	3722	B
yeah i that's what i really like and i bought a little single disc for my car	3722	B
and uh that's great i mean i every since i put that thing in my car i haven't heard a tape since	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
well i just i just got a little portable one and i bought a little they Sony makes a base unit that you can just mount in your car and so the whole package was under two hundred dollars	3722	B
yeah otherwise i mean if you buy them_1 in a car now it's like five hundred bucks for a whole unit	3722	B
yeah yeah that's that's a little extravagant you know but if you can afford the cars that it can come into you know	3722	B
it's not that bad	3722	B
but	3722	B
i haven't been to any uh since i've been out of college um and it usually the concerts that have come up lately i have been out of town uh traveling so i just haven't had the chance to go to any	3722	B
you know and i work with a bunch of young people in the office they're always going to concerts but whenever they tell me there's one coming up there's something going on and i can never go	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
of who	3722	B
uh name- the name sounds familiar	3722	B
uh-huh	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
hum	3722	B
i think that's where i saw Yanni was there was something about him dating Linda Evans	3722	B
is it really hum	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
hum	3722	B
okay uh	3722	A
music	3722	A
what type do you like	3722	A
okay	3722	A
uh i like rock semi classical soft jazz not heavy rock	3722	A
yeah i don't like uh country particularly or rap or um what else	3722	A
you're kidding	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
so who's your favorite artist right now	3722	A
great he's one of my favorites	3722	A
what-	3722	A
what is your very favorite song that Billy Joel has done	3722	A
really	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
my very favorite is still rock and roll to me	3722	A
yes i think so	3722	A
well then he has another video that she's been in uh he's like uh uh i think it is Uptown Girl and that's the first one that i had seen her in she is just so gorgeous	3722	A
uh-huh	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
well the other one that he came out with and i loved the video for it too uh it was i think on his last CD uh	3722	A
We Didn't Start the Fire	3722	A
oh i just love that song	3722	A
um-hum does he have anything new out do you know	3722	A
uh-huh	3722	A
and you never bought another one	3722	A
yes	3722	A
did you get one that loads more than one or did you get a single	3722	A
that's what we have and i'll tell you it's a lot nicer because you can you know sometimes i get tired of listening to the same artist over you know for the whole entire length of the CD and it's nice when you can randomly choose them_1 too	3722	A
um-hum um-hum	3722	A
yeah i'd like to have one of those next car i buy i don't know how expensive they are when you are putting them in	3722	A
uh-huh	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
oh that's great	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
ooh that might be a little bit more than my budget	3722	A
do you go to any concerts or anything	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
well there is someone that i just discovered like in the last couple of years and have you ever heard of Yanni	3722	A
Yanni	3722	A
he's a composer he's dating Linda Evans right now and he does i first heard when uh i first moved to Dallas about five years ago there was uh a station that played soft rock and light jazz	3722	A
and i did not think i liked jazz at all until i started listening to this station and Yanni is one of these- i guess he's kind of new {wavish} or something	3722	A
that's probably right exactly but his music is absolutely wonderful and i've kind of gotten into a little bit of this new age or new wave or whatever it may be and uh there's a lot of that that i like a	3722	A
the reason i was thinking about trials by jury and um i- i guess i thought more highly of it until the uh recent William Kennedy Smith case where they uh were telling about how they used um	3758	A
what they consider scientific methods to choose the right jurors to get the right results you know for their chance what do you think about that	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
yes	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
right	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
yes well i know um fairly recently when that um one of the court sessions for John Wylie Price i remember that um	3758	A
and though i had agreed with some of the things he did i- i disagreed with that particular case because he um	3758	A
they made they got a lot of mileage out that they that that was not a jury of his peers that um they said you know that he was found guilty and then	3758	A
he- uh then they made note that none of the the jurors were uh black or African- African American and	3758	A
and it seemed to me that if he wanted if they wanted that i mean they chose them deliberately i mean because of all of the publicity that it got from that	3758	A
and i really thought well you know one of their points that they made on purpose was they chose people who they felt were not their own peers in order to make the case against him weaker	3758	A
and it just seemed like it wasn't very fair that that you know that was something that could have been said at the very beginning and not cost the tax payers the money for that court	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	B
um-hum	3758	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3758	B
well um you know it's it's like anything else i mean i guess i probably should mention i am an attorney and i and i although i don't do trial work now i have done so in the past and um	3758	B
i have to say that i've never been in the position to uh	3758	B
uh make use of uh the types of techniques but for years there have been uh books written that everybody has access to about techniques in jury- in jury selection	3758	B
and um you know uh i mean it kind of the way it kind of really actually works out in real life i don't think it's fair	3758	B
um necessarily for one side because they have a lot of money	3758	B
to be able to uh	3758	B
you- you know it it kind of it strikes me as as unfair that if you have got enough money you can pick the jury you want and really the system doesn't exactly allow that anyway	3758	B
the best- the best you get on jury selection is is if you've got to pick a jury of twelve people you get a certain number of what they call preemptory strikes and a certain number of of	3758	B
um each side gets those and and then there are are strikes you know an unlimited number of strikes for what they call for cause	3758	B
and uh	3758	B
you- you know obviously	3758	B
people whose whose livelihood depends on um	3758	B
jury jury trials are going to use whatever they can use to try uh to improve their chances and and you know it's get- it's	3758	B
the unfair part of it is that not everybody has access to the high powered technique but then then the the saving grace is that it can only get you so far	3758	B
i mean you know it- it you may find that the first three people on the panel are ideal jurors for you but the other side is probably going to even if i was sitting there with no	3758	B
um high-powered computer input and whatnot if i could just ask them_1 questions i could tell that they're gonna be good jurors for you and bad jurors for me i'm gonna strike them_1 so you're not going to get them_1	3758	B
i mean you can't really get what you want	3758	B
you can just improve your chances of guessing who you think you want	3758	B
uh-huh	3758	B
um-hum um-hum	3758	B
yeah well you know it's it's kind of been uh uh you see a lot in the death penalty cases	3758	B
that there a lot of the attorneys there are attorneys who strongly believe that the death penalty is not right	3758	B
and they um have pretty much dedicated themselves to doing everything they can to prevent uh people sentenced to the death penalty from being executed	3758	B
and they will go through endless appeals and one of the things that has been used and and it's been used most often um in in in the death penalty cases is the fact that	3758	B
you know that the the majority of people who are convicted if they're black they may not have any blacks or they might have one black on their jury panel	3758	B
and they have tried to statistically tie this to the likelihood of him getting the death penalty	3758	B
but they've never really been successful in it and the Supreme Court has has up to this point continued to reject those types of arguments	3758	B
saying that that somebody didn't get a fair trial because there wasn't a certain quota of blacks on the jury panel	3758	B
and i really do think that those arguments will continue to fail because	3758	B
guess what	3721	A
you know Diane Lancaster did you ever meet her she was at she was at your wedding	3721	A
okay- okay she is transcribing these tapes for TI	3721	A
no	3721	A
really hey Suzy how you doing	3721	A
oh this is too crazy well i i'm glad i'm glad it's you dear because whenever i first heard the topic i said oh no i hate to talk about finances and a budget	3721	A
no huh-uh i don't either no so that covers that so what's	3721	A
i know it i know it	3721	A
have	3721	A
but you've talked three different times	3721	A
yeah well great have-	3721	A
yes	3721	A
yeah do do you uh uh have- i was going to say have you gotten your first check yet	3721	A
and you've already had two calls	3721	A
then i'm just i gosh i'm just	3721	A
that's pretty good	3721	A
yeah well you need to start doing that	3721	A
but then again- then again if you're getting three calls and you hadn't made any then you really couldn't done much more than that	3721	A
yeah	3721	A
yeah we're recording	3721	A
yeah	3721	A
yeah well i- i went ahead and started it i said shoot might as well as long as we're talking i don't think it makes that much difference whether or not we talk about the exact topic you know what i mean	3721	A
i know it	3721	A
oh it's good it's good i uh i talked to uh uh my- the guy who's going to be my new boss today he called	3721	A
they had they were changing planes in New York coming back from uh Bermuda	3721	A
and uh it looks like what i'll do a week from today i'll go back to uh uh	3721	A
Houston	3721	A
then uh	3721	A
a week from today	3721	A
yeah and then uh probably the next week what i'm going to do and maybe for the next two weeks we're not sure yet i'm going to work in the Houston office then i'm going to be working with uh the crude department	3721	A
and uh learning what i'm going to need to be doing on on that side of the business	3721	A
not uh not long term then after a week or two in Houston i'll either come back to Miami or i'll go to Bermuda	3721	A
and uh i don't know it's still pretty loosey-goosey	3721	A
well what i'm i mean i'm working i mean like i would you know like i did at	3721	A
oh well shoot you know what one of the things about this i mean i- i don't get off work until uh well we don't well we don't leave the office until sometimes it's seven o'clock at night	3721	A
and we've been staying real late cause it's a lot going on	3721	A
and then for about oh gosh the first three nights i had dinners to go to	3721	A
you know we have to go out and dine	3721	A

uh-huh	3747	A
um-hum	3747	A
yeah Richard Jung Julio recorded an album at Saint Thomas Aquinas didn't he yeah	3747	A
well that's what that's mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are Romantic music Mahler and Ruckner and and Strauss	3747	A
uh i like i'm liking it more and more now	3747	A
getting used to it	3747	A
and mostly uh mostly Mozart	3747	A
i mean there's not- there's not any kind of trumpet parts but uh you know the	3747	A
i just like the melodies more and and and uh the libretto	3747	A
um yeah well i like Rossini better than Puccini	3747	A
i like more comic than	3747	A
no	3747	A
uh no i've never been to the Dallas Opera only the Fort Worth Opera	3747	A
and my trumpet teacher used to uh play in the Fort Worth Opera	3747	A
uh John Nelson	3747	A
uh-huh	3747	A
yeah he played in the Fort Worth Symphony in Fort Worth mostly	3747	A
yeah	3747	A
yeah	3747	A
uh	3747	A
um-hum	3747	A
which Church is it	3747	A
uh uh-huh	3747	A
it seems like a lot of churches are hiring more musicians now than they used to	3747	A
um-hum	3747	A
yes	3747	A
uh-huh	3747	A
but he's still teaching at Brookhaven isn't he	3747	A
oh yeah	3747	A
yeah because i heard Glen Bell taught at Plano as well	3747	A
uh-huh	3747	A
well seeing as how i'm a musician i like all kinds of music	3747	B
all very very kinds	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
well i like everything from hard core country to you know Wagner and Mahler and i like new age stuff i- i basically have a wide range of musical likes	3747	B
do you um	3747	B
are you musical uh are you a musician at all	3747	B
do you	3747	B
jazz	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
right	3747	B
well i love Baroque music so it's one of my favorite periods	3747	B
in fact i i sing with the Texas Baroque ensemble	3747	B
well we used to have um Ralph Dutchen but now he's in Massachusetts he's come back a couple of times then there's a trumpet player at North Texas the the teacher the main teacher	3747	B
yeah and he's played and the two of them have played natural trumpets and occasionally when she can't get those people we'll use you know just uh E flat trumpets	3747	B
with valves and like Glen Bell plays and	3747	B
uh Rick um	3747	B
Bogart's played too so	3747	B
but actually i like i like trumpet and organ together	3747	B
it's a nice combination	3747	B
yeah i think he did with Paul yeah	3747	B
he's wonderful both of them are	3747	B
so do you like Romantic music	3747	B
um-hum	3747	B
do you like opera	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
there's a	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
you don't like Puccini	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
uh-huh are you going to go see The Elixir of Love	3747	B
do you ever go to the Dallas Opera	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
who was your trumpet teacher	3747	B
uh-huh i know him i kind of know him is he still around here	3747	B
because_1 i don't i've not seen him playing anywhere lately but maybe it's because_1 he's playing in Fort Worth	3747	B
well i'm basically a church musician i do a church in Plano and we do all kinds of music at my church and we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for different things	3747	B
so i'm always making music of one kind or another	3747	B
uh it's at Christ United Methodist Church in Plano	3747	B
yeah most churches have the well there's some of the few organizations that have the funds to you know to do like big big works	3747	B
uh but we hire you know we hire an orchestra at least twice a year and then different instrumentalists off and on throughout the year	3747	B
that we have you know John Cuminado	3747	B
he plays at our church a lot	3747	B
in fact he is playing this Sunday at our church	3747	B
but he plays pretty regularly	3747	B
uh i think so he teaches a lot in Plano at high schools but i think he teaches at Brookhaven	3747	B
yeah Glen teaches here too they're the two of them are mainly pretty much the i think they've cornered the market on trumpet students	3747	B
well um uh that's something i've never thought a lot about um i've i work in a hospital and i've worked in the hospital for about fifteen years and i've taken care of a few AIDS patients	3798	B
um when they asked us did did we want to um	3798	B
keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh	3798	B
i think right now what- what they're spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion	3798	B
um because_1 i think it's something that's gonna take them_1 a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know	3798	B
and um so i don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now i think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know and uh what about you	3798	B
i'm not either i'm definitely not aware of how much	3798	B
uh it's something i've never really kept up with at all	3798	B
um i don't know-	3798	B
i'm not sure uh i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the research you know what i mean and uh that sort of thing	3798	B
um if if we were talking about the money um i'd just have to say	3798	B
oh yeah i think so i think so	3798	B
yeah yeah	3798	B
yeah well that's true that's true because um it's a such an easily preventable disease	3798	B
um	3798	B
no it's definitely not	3798	B
that's true that's true um myself um um i'm just recently or about to get a divorce	3798	B
and uh course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything but it's sort of scary	3798	B
to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know what's gonna happen you don't know who you're gonna come across you know course it's it's not that i'm wanting to	3798	B
i'm not gonna wanting to go and have sex with everybody i see but it's something you got to think about these days a single person	3798	B
you know and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry and um	3798	B
certainly yeah	3798	B
but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes	3798	B
and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything and uh i don't know i don't think that's a bad idea	3798	B
i know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction it just sort of keeps that going	3798	B
but um i don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be	3798	B
you know so i don't know that i think that's i'm not too- too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i don't know what do you think about that	3798	B
it's it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic	3798	B
um-hum	3798	B
that's true that's true	3798	B
yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an AIDS AIDS would have to have come first i guess as far as	3798	B
something to uh to do about it so so i don't know um course there's so many things in the world where	3798	B
if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know	3798	B
and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i don't know but um	3798	B
but i've never looked into how much money they're spending i have i have no idea	3798	B
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that	3798	B
but uh i really have never looked into it i have no idea um	3798	B
yeah	3798	B
yeah	3798	B
right sure	3798	B
yeah	3798	B
yeah i think it is i think it is	3798	B
yeah it does every it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know but uh	3798	B
uh that's one thing i've never really feared um uh i a lot of the my family	3798	B
you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions but um uh i don't fear it at all um i work in in the operating room a lot and um and of course when we	3798	B
well Michael what do you think about um funding for AIDS research do you	3798	A
oops	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
well i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now you know	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh yeah i mean i go ahead um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh yeah	3798	A
yeah yeah i mean i- i can see that research is needed and you know definitely i mean it's becoming a major problem	3798	A
but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know	3798	A
right and i- i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer it's it's uh abstinence in certain cases and yeah and knowing you know	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah i think for a lot of people it has so	3798	A
so	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
drug addicts um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
well yeah	3798	A
boy that's- that's a hard issue it really is	3798	A
yeah i mean i- i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um	3798	A
people i mean in the meantime well someone who's not ready to give up drugs um you know if they're perpetrating- perpetrating the AIDS problem passing that on to each other then you know	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh yeah	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah i haven't either i've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough and mostly that's what i've heard so i don't know	3798	A
and yet i know it's um it sounds like big money to me but it probably takes a lot	3798	A
so	3798	A
um-hum yeah did you have any fear working in the hospital with that	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
all right are you successful in finding a good mechanic to work on your car	3780	B
oh my	3780	B
i'm lucky to get that kind of mileage out of a car most of mine go belly up about eighty thousand miles	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
well i'm kind of hard on a car uh	3780	B
i find that in most cases the the service that you get particularly at the uh dealers	3780	B
uh at least in the Washington area is so bad that i'm i just hate to take a car in to have them_1 work on it	3780	B
so i generally run a car until it falls apart and and then i fix it	3780	B
uh i'm a electronics engineer	3780	B
no i uh travel very little so i have to do the uh commuting bit and get in the traffic jam every morning and evening	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
oh my yeah you can run up a hundred thousand miles without thinking about it	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
um-hum	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
well one of the funniest stories i remember is a boss that i had one time had an Alfa Romeo	3780	B
and he hit a bad railroad crossing somewhere and knocked the oil pan out on the car	3780	B
and he took it in to have the oil pan replaced and they replaced it and it was just leaking oil constantly	3780	B
and they he kept taking it back to get the oil pan fixed and uh they never could fix it	3780	B
and after about_1 a year and a half they finally realized that the pan that they'd replaced on that did not go with that serial number engine	3780	B
and so they ordered the right one	3780	B
and he came in all beaming and proud that this thing had finally been fixed and hadn't used a drop of oil in the last four or five days	3780	B
and uh	3780	B
well he would go out at lunchtime and he for months afterwards he'd come back and he'd look at his parking spot at his office and there was this puddle of oil there	3780	B
and he couldn't figure out what was going on he'd check his oil and you know it would still be up there and it hadn't used- hadn't added any oil but there was this oil slick in his parking spot	3780	B
well what he didn't know was the mechanical engineer that worked for him was kind of a mischievous type person	3780	B
and every lunchtime when he'd go out to lunch the mechanical- the mechanical engineer would go into the shop and he'd get the used oil and come out and pour it in his parking spot	3780	B
i don't think he ever did i think that mechanic went someplace else to work before the oil slick ever cleared up	3780	B
yeah he he was wondering where that oil was coming from he's checking his dipstick every day	3780	B
well every time i hear somebody buying an MG i ask them_1 if they uh they paid the extra price to get the tool kit	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
well i just uh i have a Thunderbird that i spent last month twelve hundred bucks just on getting repairs to	3780	A
but that's that's a that's a hundred thousand mile tune-up so i guess if it'll gives me another fifty thousand in between i'll be happy with it	3780	A
but uh	3780	A
well uh i tell you it's expensive if you uh try and keep them_1 running you know keep them_1 so they're in in top shape	3780	A
uh	3780	A
i don't know-	3780	A
well	3780	A
well what do you what do you do	3780	A
uh-huh i mean do you have travel a lot in your job or not	3780	A
oh okay	3780	A
and that's good and hard on a car	3780	A
yeah it uh i uh i cover most of Texas and Oklahoma with some of the lines that i sell and and i'll put on thirty five forty thousand miles a year	3780	A
but uh	3780	A
it	3780	A
and you got to keep the car in good shape when you do that uh and- i- i'm on my third set of tires on this thing and	3780	A
uh	3780	A
yeah	3780	A
brake job and you know shocks you you do the whole thing if you want to keep it going and about_1 the only real aggravation was when they had a uh	3780	A
it turned out they had to change processor out on the car which doesn't seem that difficult a thing to do	3780	A
but it took them_1 a week before they realized that they had	3780	A
two other bad processors and uh without a car for a week in my business it's rather difficult	3780	A
i- i guess the only thing that really bothers me and uh the auto at least down here and it sounds like you got the same problem where uh	3780	A
they only have probably one really qualified mechanic in the whole garage and uh the rest are	3780	A
maybe a level above or perhaps at the grease monkey level and yet they'll they'll charge you for brain surgery on these cars as though they all know everything	3780	A
okay but	3780	A
that's a good one oh that's nasty	3780	A
just driving this guy crazy probably couldn't sleep at night worrying about his expensive car getting blown up and	3780	A
that is funny that is funny i got a customer that uh	3780	A
has a Jaguar and he and his wife have one he says well if you have a Jaguar you got to have two one for the shop and one to drive	3780	A
oh well i don't know uh	3780	A
what age you are but when i was a kid the cars you could you could fix them_1 you know i when i was in college i recall one time	3780	A
okay	3723	B
oh	3723	B
oh	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
well i understand that i've been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and i thought that'd be the time to get going	3723	B
and uh so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York and so she's not around	3723	B
and i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i don't seem to find time in the day time and of course it's motivation that's keeping me from really looking for that opportunity	3723	B
oh yeah	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah yeah well more than weight course i could use uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that i also notice i just feel better when i exercise	3723	B
and that's something that i'm motivated about now because_1 i do need to get myself feeling better and just in better shape but	3723	B
i um all the same it's connected to my attitude because i'm not feeling as perky and good i'm also it's hard to get my attitude to to get myself out there	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah yeah	3723	B
and you have less- less chance of of hurting yourself	3723	B
yeah yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because_1 she's supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then i had	3723	B
pulled a muscle in my knee actually i hyper extended it or something and uh boy i was suffering for a good three weeks later	3723	B
oh is it	3723	B
yeah yeah	3723	B
uh-huh	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah well i've got a dog now and and of course she needs walking and so that's a little less try you know- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to and	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
oh yeah	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
that's kind of an idea uh we	3723	B
we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center that's got a walking track that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year	3723	B
but i find it very tedious because i'm watching the clock constantly and it's just nothing else to look at and i actually get more tired doing that than	3723	B
i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good and there i could barely make a couple miles	3723	B
okay i was watching the soap opera awards um and and it's it's really making me wanna exercise because_1 every single woman in the audience is	3723	A
about_1 ten pounds	3723	A
so um i started anchoring last up anchoring uh exercising last	3723	A
about_1 last Spring when i- i joined the President's Health Club and i was really motivated and going and i went uh for a little while uh	3723	A
i went pretty regularly but it's hard to go regularly for a long time	3723	A
and where i live in Waco uh they don't have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's so now i don't have a club and i'm i don't have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly	3723	A
or something like that so i'm not exercising at the time at the moment so i wish i could i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that but	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
um	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
i think a lot of times if you have someone	3723	A
to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh	3723	A
sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that and that would keep you going	3723	A
um-hum um-hum	3723	A
oh yeah	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
that's very true it seems like you walk quicker and you just perky is a good word for it when you when you exercise	3723	A
and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because_1 it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't	3723	A
yeah it doesn't you know hurt you like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that	3723	A
so	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
wow	3723	A
wow	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
uh oh	3723	A
huh i guess my favorite- my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes to go yeah just- with the the stationary bikes to just ride	3723	A
and if you're watching television they usually have television in there or something or if you're listening to a walkman it's pretty it's pretty okay	3723	A
again that's sort of weird because_1 you're you've not going anywhere and it- i- i used to play racquetball and i really loved that because though it to me it had a point	3723	A
oh yeah	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
hum	3723	A
yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls	3723	A
you know like early in the mornings things like that- i never tried that	3723	A
i don't know i've i never really even thought about it really	3723	A
oh	3723	A
oh	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
um	3723	A
okay what do you do- consider as as camping	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
hm	3793	A
um-hum um-hum well the only camping the only camping i've done really is living in a tent we used- used to go to Lake Shasta like fifteen years in a row	3793	A
and uh you know take everything up there park our car unload the car and then go by boat to the camp spot you know two or three trips back to the car to unload everything	3793	A
and uh the	3793	A
no no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called Calucci Creek	3793	A
and um you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent	3793	A
and uh slept in in the tent you know on	3793	A
well	3793	A
you know what it is it's actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in that's what we use to put around our john	3793	A
yeah	3793	A
it was like two weeks	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
uh it was	3793	A
well just it was it was nice for a while but after fifteen years i got tired of it	3793	A
and then my next my next vacation trip was to Hawaii	3793	A
right right	3793	A
but uh	3793	A
i've never gone anyplace else really except Lake Shasta camping you know	3793	A
no Patterson's down by Modesto	3793	A
it's like twenty minutes away from- i used to live in Oakland	3793	A
uh and um	3793	A
used to go camping all the time up there but i've lived down here in Patterson now since eighty eight	3793	A
you know	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum do you have little kids that like to	3793	A
oh uh-huh	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
it's fun for kids though isn't it	3793	A
you know	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
um-hum well i'm ready to go camping again i- i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup deer hunting	3793	A
uh over a weekend so know lived in a camper on that	3793	A
yeah that's that's not too bad at least you're inside you don't have to worry about the bears and	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum um-hum but	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
yeah	3793	A
it it- it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven't been up to Yosemite for God i don't know how many years i would love to go up there again	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic	3793	A
it was a long time ago that i went there but i've only been there once	3793	A
you know	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
yeah yeah but it's beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the stars- all the stars up there and everything compared to uh you know living in the city-	3793	A
yes	3793	B
well um	3793	B
we've done a lot of tent camping that's probably the closest definition that i usually think of but um there are a couple of places in the San Francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are	3793	B
sort of like rustic cabins they have no um electricity and no water	3793	B
but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and	3793	B
you can spread out sleeping bags on on uh wooden surfaces so	3793	B
it's a pseudo cabin but they call it environmental camping	3793	B
we really enjoy that	3793	B
oh that's beautiful	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
is it one when you've been there is it one of those uh state park arrangements where	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
oh	3793	B
i don't think i've ever seen a john tent that's	3793	B
that's more rustic camping perhaps than i've done usually where someplace where we're sort of close to	3793	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3793	B
that's great do you usually spend then quite a few days	3793	B
oh wow	3793	B
how do you like that i don't think i've ever been camping quite that long that seems like	3793	B
without showers and all you how how did you	3793	B
how did you enjoy that	3793	B
so it was sort of an annual thing every year for a while	3793	B
sounds like fun thing about Shasta too is there's so many other things that you can do	3793	B
uh-huh is Patterson fairly close to Shasta	3793	B
oh okay	3793	B
oh well	3793	B
yeah	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
there are a lot of uh camping grounds county and state facilities in the Santa Cruz mountains south of here so	3793	B
tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes	3793	B
we have one two year old so actually we'd been camping for a long time before she was born and just now introducing her to her it to her rather	3793	B
yeah they really enjoy it i think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and	3793	B
i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so	3793	B
hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
um-hum that's that's kind of fun we did that once in Yosemite too	3793	B
right that was one good reason in Yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure	3793	B
yes in fact i've never been camping at all in Yosemite outside of the uh the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins	3793	B
that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but	3793	B
yeah it's a beautiful place i think i worry that it's changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular	3793	B
do you remember it a a long time ago i don't know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or	3793	B
oh uh-huh	3793	B
my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little um and that at that time there really weren't delegated- designated campsites so um	3793	B
people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their their terrain and	3793	B
it's a little bit better arrangement today	3793	B
um-hum um-hum	3793	B
okay and you want to talk about this weather wow i wanna talk about how mild it was at Christmas time	3778	B
well that was uh totally unbelievable for the first time in a long time i left plants outside and they didn't freeze so that was pretty good um yeah	3778	B
yeah	3778	B
oh you did oh that's terrible	3778	B
well what'd you do to prepare for that	3778	B
i see	3778	B
oh you did oh good for you uh-huh	3778	B
no i um that happened to a friend of ours actually they have a condominium and um they- they went out to the grocery store and were out for oh a couple of hours	3778	B
and when they came home the the pipe had broken and their their ground floor was flooded so uh it it's it's a major horror when when that kind of thing occurs	3778	B
oh	3778	B
oh oh no uh-huh	3778	B
oh my goodness isn't that terrible thing yeah	3778	B
oh	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
yeah oh oh my goodness well	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
well you know sometimes in a funny kind of way life treats us like that that something we wouldn't normally do when we're placed in the circumstance we go ahead and do it and then	3778	B
uh things are kind of better afterwards and it it ultimately gives you an uplift i i i guess you have to look at it like that anyway or you might get depressed and God forbid but anyway	3778	B
but uh we had visitors from New York i'm really not from this area you must detect that i'm really- originally from the New York area and we had visitors uh both from New York and from California at Christmas time	3778	B
and um usually it is uh somewhat cold i mean cold enough to put on a winter coat or at least heavy sweaters and it was so mild here that uh they had to of course	3778	B
poke several funny jokes at us down here with this funny weather and you know whatever uh but uh i think they were very uh pleasantly happy because one person has um	3778	B
uh arthritis kind of stuff and um	3778	B
when it gets very cold they all crink up you know and uh we didn't have any of that kind of problem this year so we were uh very grateful for that kind of thing	3778	B
that's right um-hum yeah uh-huh of course in California they have such a steadily more moderate climate that the temperatures even in the areas around San Francisco we used to live	3778	B
down in that Bay area the temperatures never got excessively cold if it got down around thirty two just about	3778	B
uh then the people would start panicking over the artichoke uh crops and uh avocados and of course down south the	3778	B
the orange groves and things like that you know the weather really does have a lot of effect on so many things and um when they grow those oranges down in the southlands they have these	3778	B
braziers out in the field and they go around putting fires on if the temperatures gets down around thirty two or thirty and just levels off there so that	3778	B
they can uh regulate it by means of those like man made not too difficult um uh ways to to save the crops	3778	B
yeah	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
uh-huh	3778	B
right of course uh-huh	3778	B
oh oh yes oh it's it's really well that happened here in Texas with the grapefruits that year a couple of years ago	3778	B
and the grapefruit crop was very uh very scarce uh so uh you know all of these major things the poor farmers but um	3778	B
anyway we'll just uh hope that uh we're not in for too many big freezes now but i know one big one will come	3778	B
and in it always does and uh i really don't mind those uh few uh snow flurries and those few days when there's a bit of snow	3778	B
okay	3778	A
yeah it's something else	3778	A
yeah how about_1 that huh	3778	A
yes	3778	A
yeah that's true uh the- i think it was last year around this time it was when we had the really really hardened cold snap	3778	A
i had a pipe break on me so it flooded the house and everything	3778	A
so i was trying to be prepared this time around	3778	A
uh well it was an outside pipe so now- this time i made sure i wrapped them_1 up real good um-hum	3778	A
i don't wanna go through that again	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
ah	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
well with us we were out of town over the Christmas holiday and our neighbor called us to say hey you guys did you leave the water running	3778	A
yeah they saw the the water coming out from under the door	3778	A
yeah so we cut our vacation short but i guess it wasn't too bad uh we ended up getting all new carpet downstairs and part of the upstairs so	3778	A
it wasn't it wasn't a real pleasant but uh you know looking back it- it was a good deal because we did need new carpet	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
exactly	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
that's true	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
oh	3778	A
sure sure	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum um-hum	3778	A
that's great	3778	A
yeah so you had the kind of weather that uh it was nice to go out at night on	3778	A
yeah that's great	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum um-hum	3778	A
hum oh	3778	A
i see	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
right	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
hum	3778	A
wow	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
right right that's right you know uh you- you usually don't think of that uh you know being i guess being in a urban area if it gets cold you know	3778	A
you- you well let's think about water freezing and pipes breaking but down there they got all those crops to worry about	3778	A
yeah yeah right- i remember that	3778	A
that's right	3778	A
right	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
it always happens huh	3778	A
sure i'd say there's pretty- quite pretty-	3778	A
okay_1 i guess we start talking about the budget	3739	A
okay you you live near the nation's capital what can we do about this mess	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
i see big opportunities in Europe opening up uh it just it just seems to me like we ought to be able to go over there and help the people become a capitalistic society	3739	A
uh	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
another thing i think the uh that the President could do right now on a short term basis to get things speeded up is	3739	A
help out the working people right now the middle income people uh give them_1 some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i	3739	A
basically remember getting some sort of tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car	3739	A
uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate	3739	A
well i've always believed in paying my fair share of of of taxes oh and whatever my government says is my fair share is what i think i should pay	3739	A
uh i don't necessarily agree with people who go out of their way to find loopholes and not paying their fair share	3739	A
yeah the lady who does my taxes for me every year it seems like she's got a new suggestion	3739	A
and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i don't uh since i no longer work uh usually it's not very complicated anymore but uh	3739	A
i no longer work uh oh it's been almost three years ago i had some uh strange heart problems occur	3739	A
and uh so i'm more or less hang around the house and uh that sort of thing	3739	A
yeah it's uh	3739	A
i know for the i thought maybe i would go back to work especially during that first year and then they finally decided that then maybe i'll never work again	3739	A
so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially and things like that i can no longer afford things that maybe i used to take for granted	3739	A
and i certainly can't invest money like i used to	3739	A
well	3739	A
what kind of work did you do when you were working	3739	A
oh yeah	3739	A
very good sir	3739	B
well uh living near the nation's capital unfortunately doesn't do you any good uh all i all i uh find that i can do is read the newspapers and try to decide what's best for us	3739	B
what we need to do and that's sort of a function of the economy	3739	B
and our relationship with uh other countries and so forth and right now we're in this big change since Russia has undergone such a uh big uh renegotiation within themselves	3739	B
and i'm sure that we haven't quite decided where we stand in that yet	3739	B
yes i think they're looking for that they just need guidance yes that would be very good for us to help	3739	B
show them what it what it takes to have a a capitalistic society and one in which each of them has a a say and uh you know can express their thoughts safely	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
oh i don't recall ever getting a rebate but it does seem as though if if we are able to	3739	B
reduce the our expenditures for defense course we've got to get get this big debt that the country has under control	3739	B
and if as we get that under control then i'd like to see the taxes that we pay reduced	3739	B
a certain amount you know so that we're all comfortable but i do believe that the country's gonna have to get itself straightened out {debtwise} before uh they could do too much that way	3739	B
but i hate to see them_1 raise the taxes if it's unnecessary	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
sure that makes sense	3739	B
yes it it it seems as though a lot of the things that we see in the paper and in letters that you receive are showing you loopholes or how not to pay your share and that really is sort of against what the whole ball game's about isn't it	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
you no longer work	3739	B
oh my	3739	B
well you have more experience at that than i i just retired from working myself on December thirty first so i haven't really had time to look at it from the retiree point of view	3739	B
but it'll be an interesting uh concept i'm sure	3739	B
hm	3739	B
yes that	3739	B
i understand well it's unfortunate you had that problem and i do hope you will be able to work out your circumstances so that you can live comfortably and feel confident that you are doing your share of the taxes	3739	B
and you know still there are certain things that you need to do in your family and yourself	3739	B
to enjoy life to its fullest	3739	B
i was working uh in doing research for the government	3739	B
so i know what it's like i had worked for the government basically i'm actually i'm a professor a retired professor at Penn State	3739	B
and uh but my work has always been in research uh related uh to the government so i'm i'm aware of what it takes to perform the work that's needed	3739	B
and	3739	B
the government has got to decide what it needs to know and then set up the criteria by which problems are solved and and uh the	3739	B
um i i'm pretty flexible i- i could like- i like just about everything minus um hard rock	3712	B
and i don't really like um	3712	B
rap	3712	B
but i like classical jazz um you know um	3712	B
contemporary i don't know what you call it i guess light rock or easy listening or whatever what about you	3712	B
hang on excuse- me <b_aside> Rusty no <e_aside>	3712	B
my dog's getting in the trash okay go ahead	3712	B
um-hum	3712	B
um-hum	3712	B
and who who in the Christian contemporary do you like to listen to	3712	B
uh-huh	3712	B
uh-huh	3712	B
i don't either unless i know that i like uh you know a lot of the music on a particular cassette	3712	B
but i do uh my husband's from Latin America and uh so i listen to Salsa which is typical of where he's from and	3712	B
and it it's a really lively fun music you'll you'll find yourself just moving just listening to it	3712	B
it's it's fun but mostly i'll listen to uh	3712	B
i guess i listen to easy listening in the car but if i am at home i'll listen to i don't know if if not jazz you know it'll be some type of uh	3712	B
like i was talking about you know the music from his area or um i like gospel music i listen to a lot of i like a cappella gospel	3712	B
there's a group called Take Six that that does some really lovely stuff and some of it is a little too um	3712	B
it's too i mean it- it's- it's too much along the lines of of a lot of black music it's too uh it's not rap but it's just not enough gospel for me but their first um works that came out i really enjoyed them	3712	B
yeah i have heard of him the name rings familiar i don't know why though	3712	B
um-hum	3712	B
hm well that sounds nice	3712	B
yeah i like classical guitar too um Strings and Fur i don't know if you heard of them they are not exactly classical but they have got some really lovely music out that is along those lines	3712	B
and who else God i've got we've got a couple really good um tapes i cannot remember who else	3712	B
there's another group called Gypsy Kings that i listen to that it's- it's in Spanish but even if you don't understand it it sings a lot of stuff that that anybody's familiar with like you remember the song Volare oh well anyways	3712	B
i remember the song and um you know it's a lot of guitar type of uh from Spain type stuff it's really beautiful	3712	B
yeah	3712	B
yes i have i have i don't have any of his work but i do like like it i have heard it on the Oasis	3712	B
have you	3712	B
uh-huh	3712	B
yeah	3712	B
um yeah there's there's a little bit- of- that- bit of that in there	3712	B
yeah-	3712	B
exactly well i think we have covered it	3712	B
what do you think	3712	B
it was nice talking to you too have a good evening bye-bye	3712	B
well Wendy what kind of music do you like	3712	A
um-hum	3712	A
um-hum	3712	A
um-hum um a lot the same i don't like hard rock at all and i uh don't like um	3712	A
rap either i don't care too much for jazz sometimes a few things i have heard that i like but	3712	A
okay	3712	A
and um i like classical and i like um	3712	A
a lot of different kinds of contemporary um folksy type where you can hear the words and um you know where there are something they're saying	3712	A
um i guess my preference is um well either classical or Christian contemporary or uh praise type songs	3712	A
um i don't have a particular favorite i um	3712	A
i like some of the music that's put out by Hosannah um Integrity tapes they're instrumental mostly um where they just have um	3712	A
praise songs and it's set to just instruments or um praise songs with words um	3712	A
there's a few things i don't pay too much attention i turn the radio on and i don't always pay attention to who is singing what i just know there's a song here a song there i like i don't spend a lot of money buying tapes and stuff so	3712	A
yeah	3712	A
yeah	3712	A
uh-huh	3712	A

um	3712	A
um-hum	3712	A
um-hum have your ever heard of John Michael Talbot	3712	A
yeah	3712	A
yeah i guess i he's one that at least i know you know if i hear his name i'll probably like it cause i he just has a real	3712	A
quiet reflective i think he just accompanies himself on the guitar and uh classical guitar and i really like classical guitar yeah	3712	A
hm uh-huh	3712	A
yeah i think so uh-huh uh-huh	3712	A
yeah have you ever heard of um a Venezuelan he's local but he's cut a couple of albums now or whatever you call them_1 these days CDs i guess	3712	A

oh yeah and and what kind of books do you read	3760	B
oh yeah	3760	B
oh do you like those detective stories	3760	B
oh well that's interesting i- i actually like to read also but	3760	B
i usually fall into one of two categories either	3760	B
true science fiction or fantasy on one hand or highly technical	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
kind of one or the other	3760	B
i	3760	B
i do yes	3760	B
yeah and i'm a computer scientist	3760	B
but i have a lot of other hobbies i- i well yeah i- i i'm kind of um	3760	B
i- i guess what you'd call it a project person yeah and i love i like i have a shop and	3760	B
when things break around the house i always try and fix them_1 myself and so hobby it's- it's- it's its funny uh from the one stand point it's work	3760	B
but it's a hobby too that that i enjoy to do to find broken	3760	B
well essentially anything you'd find in a house	3760	B
uh a a stove or an oven or a broken piece of porcelain or uh	3760	B
chipped tile on the floor i mean just anything	3760	B
well it's it's not anything elaborate it's just a work bench with a gazillion tools	3760	B
but enough that	3760	B
again for anything in the house i can probably	3760	B
right	3760	B
and in the car i guess the car too	3760	B
so that's i- i think i would probably consider that a hobby although sometimes it gets to be excessive	3760	B
yeah i	3760	B
right yeah i- i think it it	3760	B
it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances	3760	B
so do you have any artistic- um i wanna- i guess i wanna say creative or artistic hobbies	3760	B
oh yeah well that's good	3760	B
yeah well i don't necessarily either i can plink out a song or two on a piano and i can	3760	B
um i- i don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art i guess graphics arts is that what that would be called it i can't like do any of that but sweat shirts is certainly impressive	3760	B
um-hum	3760	B
oh yeah	3760	B
oh yeah	3760	B
uh-huh	3760	B
i see well that's neat that's a i guess i consider that a hobby do you do you cook for a hobby or do you	3760	B
do you	3760	B
that's something you	3760	B
i understand that	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
uh right	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
but i think that still borders on hobby	3760	B
probably the other thing i do which	3760	B
i'm sure it'll sound horrible to you but is i program for fun on my computer	3760	B
so i'll i have little projects little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies	3760	B
but drive my wife crazy	3760	B
i do yes	3760	B
in fact there's actually several of them here right now not not all of them being mine	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
so uh i wonder if you you could construe raising children as being a hobby	3760	B
um-hum	3760	B
okay um we're guess we're supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time um	3760	A
i basically read books	3760	A
what i do sometimes when everybody's off gone to bed my kids are in bed my husband in bed i just every once in a while i'll just stay up and	3760	A
finish a book that i'm i usually have about three books that i'm going on i'll work on one for a little bit you know and then on the next one but that's kind of	3760	A
not always just sometimes	3760	A
um just really different ones um	3760	A
i had one that i was reading on um raising your children and another one on a	3760	A
on a biography and another one on a um	3760	A
um like a crime story you know a truth crime story	3760	A
yeah but it this this is a true one it was this seemed a little different so i was reading that one last night	3760	A
yeah its like my husband	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
you must uh work for TI yeah my husband does too	3760	A
yeah it gets	3760	A
uh-huh really	3760	A
oh really	3760	A
yeah yeah like what kinds of things do you fix	3760	A
oh and you have a shop	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah you can fix just about everything and anything	3760	A
well that's great	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah that's that's pretty much like my husband he's	3760	A
he's pretty uh mobile in that area too he he works on the cars we barely take them_1 in	3760	A
he works on irons- irons and all those TV's and stuff too we rarely have to take those things in too	3760	A
oh yeah yeah definitely	3760	A
um	3760	A
gosh not really i mean i during Christmas i work on you know like	3760	A
um holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things but	3760	A
but um	3760	A
not really	3760	A
oh	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
uh-huh	3760	A
um i belong to this organization for um with- if you have preschool children you know	3760	A
and uh every once and a while they'll have a a craft um session for the moms	3760	A
and those are really neat and we learned to do the um transfer pictures on the sweatshirts	3760	A
transfer photos and um those are really neat so we learn different crafts like that um	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
no i cook dinner and its not i don't consider it a hobby but um	3760	A
you know i no i'm not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately i like to bake off and on and usually once a week i'll bake something but its not	3760	A
anything elaborate you know	3760	A
at least i don't think it is	3760	A
so	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
uh-huh	3760	A
uh-huh	3760	A
oh	3760	A
well good you have a computer at home	3760	A
oh good yeah	3760	A
oh really	3760	A
wow then you are busy	3760	A
wow that's really good	3760	A
well you know one of the books that i did read- that i was reading and i stopped because it's so	3760	A
its the book is so detailed and you have to sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again because i didn't quite get it all	3760	A
and uh it is so detailed	3760	A
who uh does your family keep a budget at all or	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
ah	3705	A
ah	3705	A
huh	3705	A
oh really	3705	A
uh-huh	3705	A
you-	3705	A
three extra days you'd a yeah	3705	A
about it huh yeah we've uh we've been trying to save for a house we've been really trying to penny pinch and	3705	A
i tell you it gets tough when you know we have i've tried to write something out on a computer and stuff but it seems like every week there's something that comes up and makes it about impossible to	3705	A
car breaks down or somebody gets sick or	3705	A
exactly	3705	A
but	3705	A
are you uh are you able to plan or save anything for the healthy future or no i know it it's a day to day thing	3705	A
yeah i know all that's we i have my wife and a daughter and	3705	A
it's about impossible	3705	A
well that's good to hear	3705	A
and there's nothing you can do about it huh	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
yeah it makes you wonder how they get it all i mean	3705	A
oh do you	3705	A
huh	3705	A
just it	3705	A
yeah well that's what's amazed us is we've been trying to get into a house and i just i just with what we make a payment i mean it's about double what we pay for rent i just can't see how people do it these days	3705	A
so	3705	A
well it's actually Utah's been lucky we haven't been hit by the recession so housing prices have stayed up the only thing that's helping us is that the mortgage rates are going down but uh it's still moving pretty brisk and	3705	A
i say we've been kind of lucky we haven't been hit with the same kind of stuff that the rest of the nation has	3705	A
we've been able to stay out of you know that we haven't lost many jobs or anything like that up around	3705	A
yeah that nursing	3705	A
um-hum	3705	A
oh do you you just work on call huh	3705	A
huh	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
oh yeah definitely	3705	A
definitely sounds	3705	A
yeah but it sounds like you've been doing all right with it so	3705	A
um-hum	3705	A
yeah so do you have a family or	3705	A
oh do you	3705	A
enough to keep you kind of busy yeah	3705	A
yeah that's true yeah i uh that's what uh	3705	A
you know we're trying to we well i mean we've got a long ways off before school starts my daughter's just eighteen months but	3705	A
you know you think about it i had to struggle my whole time through college you know pay for my own and get an occasional grant here and there but	3705	A
i just don't know how you know they can ever do it in ten years fifteen years from now when i have to go and	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
and a small little you know two bedroom home with you know five hundred square feet is about sixty thousand it seems like and those are pretty hefty payments to	3705	A
well that's in Utah like i say i think we're we're probably below the market for the most part we're pretty lucky that way but	3705	A
hasn't it	3705	A
uh-huh	3705	A
ooh	3705	A
oh that's not bad	3705	A
um-hum	3705	A
i just know what my bills are and	3705	B
how much i need for that and what's extra i'm a nurse and so i kind of figure i'm taking home a hundred dollars a day	3705	B
so when i look at things like to buy or anything i think of it in days	3705	B
oh that's a good one	3705	B
well that's what happens that's exactly what happens it	3705	B
um-hum um-hum so just when you think you might get a little ahead that's right that's what happens	3705	B
so that's kind of hard but	3705	B
no no not at all	3705	B
not at all i- i barely get by	3705	B
have more money and some don't and that's it so uh-huh and and i'm lucky i have a very low mortgage payment because_1 i- i had my house for a long time and	3705	B
i don't have a car payment and you know i- i don't have a lot of things so i'm pretty lucky but i have to make- come up with the money totally by myself so that's hard too you know	3705	B
yeah how is housing there	3705	B
yeah	3705	B
yeah yeah	3705	B
yeah well i'm lucky i'll never lose	3705	B
but you know it doesn't matter if i lose a job one place i'll just go somewhere else so	3705	B
yeah	3705	B
oh oh yeah really and and they get a little picky in one place and	3705	B
i know where i am now there's a whole big new administration and they're they're scaring everybody to death but i don't work on staff i just work on call	3705	B
and- um-hum and so i have a couple of agencies that i work for and i make much more money that way and i can be independent i don't have to go to all the meetings and get into the politics and	3705	B
i don't get the benefits but i think it's more than worth it then i just pay for that so yeah it's a great thing but it's risky and most people don't wanna	3705	B
do that	3705	B
yeah i've i feel like it you know and it's much more interesting that way too you don't get burned out so much so	3705	B
oh	3705	B
well i know what you mean it does look impossible you look around you and i don't know how young people buy houses today or anything i really don't know and	3705	B
oh that's terrible	3705	B
yeah	3705	B
oh yeah well it's not too bad in this area really the thing is there's a lot of money and like i'm in Plano so it's a little bit north of Dallas but	3705	B
but there's so much money in this town and there are things that are three hundred and five hundred thousand and lots and lots of them	3705	B
but you can buy a nice three bedroom home for like eighty thousand	3705	B
so it really isn't it's low compared to the rest of the country you know and there's all kinds of	3705	B
oh really i i've spent three years um teaching in public schools and elementary school	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
i taught in Utah and uh	3776	B
did you teach in California	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
you sound pretty young for a university professor	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
um-hum	3776	B
well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because_1 i don't think we did that in Utah	3776	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
uh-huh yeah	3776	B
true	3776	B
um-hum um-hum	3776	B
yeah i see what you're saying yeah i totally agree	3776	B
oh yeah	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
well i've i haven't taught in Iowa but i've taught in Utah and um	3776	B
people there were saying that	3776	B
the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home	3776	B
or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids yeah well	3776	B
well uh maybe it was the area i was in but a lot of schools had lot of transient um families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side and	3776	B
yeah and i mean like you said how they were the schools were doing more things for the kids	3776	B
they thought than they were thirty years ago i mean they were the school i was teaching at the the year i left they're considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids	3776	B
as well as hot lunch and	3776	B
i uh spent four years as a university professor and yeah	3776	A
oh do you really that's great	3776	A
no kidding	3776	A
what-	3776	A
i did i did um	3776	A
well i was pretty young well- i was uh i had never intended to do it and i was uh	3776	A
uh given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system	3776	A
at any rate um the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is um	3776	A
research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning	3776	A
have you ever	3776	A
well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and uh what what it involves basically	3776	A
is the use of peer groups and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person	3776	A
to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh	3776	A
gain a competence with respect to the material	3776	A
um i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution	3776	A
in the way we learn uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system	3776	A
uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators	3776	A
and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results so my feeling is that um	3776	A
the the problem is is	3776	A
uh significant there are plenty of good people uh available to	3776	A
um offer people educational experience but that we just have to reallocate- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and uh i think	3776	A
certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um	3776	A
uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning	3776	A
and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually i don't know what form it'll ultimately take	3776	A
um	3776	A
uh but i think that	3776	A
the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for	3776	A
uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that	3776	A
uh	3776	A
i- i don't	3776	A
i don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it as- both as quote unquote students and as teachers	3776	A
but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities	3776	A
in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh you must see kids with real significant problems um in some cases	3776	A
uh course Iowa City i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City is it is it uh deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or	3776	A
right	3776	A
even in Utah	3776	A
well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe	3776	A
yeah you see- you saw a fair number of troubled kids	3776	A
yeah	3776	A
yeah	3776	A
okay yeah Donna um you said you have three children what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them is it you know	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
uh-huh that's neat	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
so do you find it difficult to find time or is it pretty natural uh-huh	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah yeah do you work during the day	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
i can imagine yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
yeah so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in America	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
oh that's good yeah	3720	A
yeah well families are facing a challenge i know that with i'm a newlywed and we're you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years and	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah but i do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because_1	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
okay um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and um	3720	B
uh my husband let's see he coaches basketball with Brian um so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side	3720	B
um he's a real sports kind of person so he plays tennis with with the kids we all kind of play tennis as a family except the baby plays on the play ground we take turns with her um	3720	B
uh let's see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer um	3720	B
uh let's see what else we do oh i suppose we watch a little TV together we really don't watch i think as much TV as a lot of people we don't have HBO we do get the Disney channel for the kids	3720	B
uh my kids have the Nintendo which they play and my husband sometimes joins them_1 with that	3720	B
uh my little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things and i'll take some time and do that with her	3720	B
and of course we always read a bed time story at night and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story um	3720	B
basically the story person because_1 my husband doesn't have he gets home from work late or whatever and and usually once in a while he'll read the story to the little one but that's basically my job um	3720	B
it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it and that's kind of cutting into your your time	3720	B
and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine they go upstairs at nine	3720	B
and um now this weekend we'll have a baby sitter come and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late maybe- maybe Brian will still be up and	3720	B
spend some time with him but it is it's really hard you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think	3720	B
uh no i don't work i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities that was two days a week and even just those two days	3720	B
just seemed like it was a lot i don't know how i admire people that that can do it all but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard	3720	B
um even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything and that's another thing i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend and	3720	B
that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son and and they'll be my helper and then they'll get to pick out some of the favorite snacks that they get to pick out so try to do things like that but it you know it's it's uh	3720	B
and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too you fit it in with all that the that	3720	B
i i think a lot of people a lot of people sit sit their kids in front of the TV and HBO and rent movies and and	3720	B
kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know it's very very easy to fall into that trap and i'm not um totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape but um	3720	B
um i think different parts of the country i think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids people are real	3720	B
sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and you know but um	3720	B
what um-hum	3720	B
um-hum and it's it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to to cut back to one and um um	3720	B
but you know if you have the type of job i have a friend that's a nurse and she can pick her hours and that's a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to uh	3720	B
spend time with the children and uh and your husband and	3720	B
do everything at once	3720	B
well i think it's a big it's a big um responsibility you just don't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single	3720	B
when you have children you have to say now this is different and you do have to give things up i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um	3720	B
for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it because they	3720	B
yeah as far as i'm concerned and	3784	B
probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching uh Reasonable Doubts which had a you know capital case in it	3784	B
and uh my- i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony	3784	B
mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day	3784	B
um-hum	3784	B
well	3784	B
i- i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation	3784	B
but i do know that some people	3784	B
almost all people usually die before that point	3784	B
they just get too old	3784	B
um	3784	B
as far as capital punishment on on it's own merits	3784	B
i have the trouble with the way it's applied	3784	B
i think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner	3784	B
uh and i've i've said this very often and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent	3784	B
because if you're if you're black and you kill a white guy you're going to fry period they will kill you	3784	B
if you're black and you kill a black guy you know it's you know two hundred hours of community service	3784	B
yeah	3784	B
well it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship	3784	B
you know we're the majority so we can do whatever the hell we wanna do	3784	B
and you're the minority and you're stuck with it	3784	B
but uh	3784	B
you know we had this in the Vietnam war you know we had you know population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent	3784	B
but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent	3784	B
the handwriting's on the wall there isn't it	3784	B
you know	3784	B
but that's another issue altogether	3784	B
as- as far as capital punishment	3784	B
i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days	3784	B
and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence	3784	B
well that- that goes back to when uh America was a a colony of England	3784	B
in England you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent	3784	B
and	3784	B
once they found you guilty you know the judge said he's guilty kill him	3784	B
well there- there were some people that uh had a problem with that	3784	B
because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me	3784	B
and uh or he'll have somebody lie for him you know people lie it's a strange thing but they do that	3784	B
and	3784	B
to prevent that kind of misuse of power	3784	B
they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap	3784	B
and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy uh at E Systems	3784	B
they were going- to- they convicted him	3784	B
of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit	3784	B
he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of a	3784	B
an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people	3784	B
you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy	3784	B
you know they all look the same to me you know	3784	B
big lips flat nose yep that was him	3784	B
uh-huh	3784	A
i do too	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
why is it you know i- i'm i'm in that same i think if it's uh	3784	A
if it's a convicted- if it's a convicted uh felon on parole	3784	A
uh and he goes out and and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i- i feel the same way i don't think i think that person is is beyond uh	3784	A
rehabilitation and and he should be	3784	A
taken out	3784	A
uh-huh	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
uh-huh	3784	A

huh	3784	A
yep it sure is	3784	A
yeah it's	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
see the only thing i don't you know i don't understand i guess i- i don't understand our judicial system uh as it is right now because i	3784	A
you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death	3784	A
how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal	3784	A
and get stays of execution- execution i mean how you know is there	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
uh-huh	3784	A

yeah i- i- i rather enjoy the Cosby Show my wife and i both like Commish	3777	A
uh it's either Friday night it's either tonight or tomorrow night um around here at least	3777	A
i guess it depends on what channel you're getting you know what system you're getting it through	3777	A
uh we we always enjoyed it it it seems to be kind of halfway between um	3777	A
something like All In The Family and uh Hill Street Blues	3777	A
uh it's- it's- it's- it's a good show	3777	A
you tend	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
he- he tenderhearted fellow	3777	A
yeah i- i guess that's what first drew us to him the uh	3777	A
the the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours	3777	A
but uh	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
yeah um	3777	A
yeah um i don't know we uh	3777	A
watch Commish any chance we get	3777	A
um used to be a big fan of Star Trek but that's kind of they- they- it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against um anything	3777	A
spiritual	3777	A
but uh	3777	A
anyway	3777	A
yeah i- i used to be a used to be a real big fan of Star Trek	3777	A
um pretty much yeah i always enjoyed the show anyway	3777	A
and Star Trek's in a set- the uh Star Wars set	3777	A
uh the one of the first Star Wars movie	3777	A
i think i watched it something like nineteen times	3777	A
uh i did at one time anyway	3777	A
oh a pretty big fan of that sort of thing used to used to read a read a lot of science fiction work too	3777	A
but uh	3777	A

that that's that's the best way you- you haven't found out yet or anything have you	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
that's the best way	3777	A
i mean it's like finding out somewhere in July what you're gonna get for Christmas i mean you know it's it's it's not as much fun oh	3777	A
anyway	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
oh i'm about half kid heart anyway	3777	A
i- i	3777	A
well	3777	A
the new cartoons don't seem to be worth much but the uh well a couple of the uh ones Disney's doing aren't too bad but	3777	A
oh yeah	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
the the the worst of the violence in the Flintstones was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot	3777	A
but oh shoot i mean blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet or or or you know or on all the you know everything of this species you know just all kinds of crud	3777	A
yeah everything's mutations and and and killing and	3777	A
gone are the days of those things they use what was it i uh uh TNT- uh Turner Broadcasting Network used to	3777	A
used to uh do the Saturday morning and Sunday morning cartoons the old cartoons they used to put between the first and second feature at the theatre	3777	A
those old little ten minute jobs where the uh the real ballooned looking art work you know and- and	3777	A
um i guess one of my favorite ones is Cheers	3777	B
i always liked that one they're always so funny and i also like The Cosby Show those are probably my two favorites	3777	B
you know i've watched that one time and it was really good but now that's on what Saturday night	3777	B
is it Saturday	3777	B
uh-huh i can't i can't remember	3777	B
uh-huh yeah i yeah i saw it one time and i really liked it but i just haven't uh seen it you know watched it since	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
yeah the episode that i watched um	3777	B
i liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason	3777	B
and he seems to do that sometimes	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
yeah i thought it was a pretty good show	3777	B
i also like i- i like to watch like Sixty Minutes and Twenty Twenty	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
i've never gotten into the Star Trek era	3777	B
used to be a Trekkie huh	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
oh my goodness you must have some of the lines memorized	3777	B
wow	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
twelve week oh i was gonna say i hear a baby in the background	3777	B
i imagine that keeps you busy	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
well we're we're expecting our first in about three months so i know we won't be watching as much as we do now	3777	B
oh wow	3777	B
that must be tough	3777	B
it doesn't matter just a healthy baby	3777	B
well we had a sonogram but we told him not to tell us so it's gonna be a surprise	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
yeah it's- it's not quite the same	3777	B
yeah i agree i'm sure we'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows	3777	B
oh i am too i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while when my sister comes to visit so	3777	B
well you know it seems like a lot of them_1 are a lot more violent than they used to be	3777	B
you know i remember like the Flintstones and the Jetsons and those were just kind of good old cartoons	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
yep	3777	B
yeah and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
um-hum	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
okay have you painted something lately	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
oh yeah another bedroom	3756	A
hm yeah yeah yeah	3756	A
you know where you get around the edge	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
well how do you get the edge though the the straight edge oh i see	3756	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3756	A
huh	3756	A
well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too	3756	A
oh really	3756	A
oh oh nice	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
oh that'd be nice	3756	A
hm or two tone or two tone	3756	A
you know	3756	A
uh-huh well the white but i have a problem i can't get up high and we can't paint the chimney	3756	A
well we have one of those ladders we're just not willing to get up that high	3756	A
well we did too we did it in the fall and it's just it's too high it's really scary but	3756	A
and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that but is other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
the blowers	3756	A
oh oh oh oh i know what you're talking about um scaffolds that's it	3756	A
huh	3756	A
it's	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
oh my so that was worth it getting a professional for that	3756	A
oh i think that's what we might have to do with the chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself	3756	A
it wasn't too bad i mean you save	3756	A
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty	3756	A
you know since it's a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it but in in in that way you know you're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it	3756	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
my word	3756	A
um-hum	3756	A
um-hum	3756	A
oh my word	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
oh my word so that was really worth it painting his own house	3756	A
but uh i think i'll probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little	3756	A
oh i know but it's that it's the textured wall	3756	A
he can still	3756	A
yes i have that room i showed you and then since then we painted the bedroom	3756	B
yeah i showed you that one too didn't i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
oh yeah	3756	B
well i've heard now i asked Janice somebody recently about how- how you do that	3756	B
oh uh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that they'd have special rollers	3756	B
that are real soft and furry that you'd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful	3756	B
we use a a two inch brush with uh on a slant	3756	B
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes	3756	B
but	3756	B
well yeah i think i'm going to do it this spring actually	3756	B
there're there're six houses see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials there's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses	3756	B
so i'm thinking i'm gonna change it to something you know the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones i think i'm gonna put something like a brown on it	3756	B
on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something something- where it'll stand out a little	3756	B
what color'd you paint	3756	B
what- yeah	3756	B
there's some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house	3756	B
on the outside-	3756	B
well you got to get one of those ladders	3756	B
oh yeah well a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he's done his house and that's what he i was out there last weekend he's finished everything except the chimney	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
yeah yeah i know our house in New Mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it	3756	B
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff	3756	B
so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid and he came with with his own rafter- uh what do you call those things no those where you built like a rafter thing	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
scaffolds yeah he came and did it that way and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up	3756	B
and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactuses and if he fell he was dead and he knew that so	3756	B
yeah plus he cleaned up my mess	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
yeah that	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to oh Furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons	3756	B
and anyway he when he checked out they only- and and he was using his Furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something	3756	B
and he had he had the bill- he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint	3756	B
so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something	3756	B
and he saw it- i guess yeah it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
uh	3756	B
yeah rollers are so messy we never mess with them anymore	3756	B
well still a paintbrush	3756	B
uh what do you	3717	A
well i don't know i would hate i would rather not have to have it all taken out but i kind of feel like	3717	A
it's part of living in a free country but it seems like they take quite a bit out	3717	A
oh yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
you probably know like i say you're a lot more knowledgeable about it than i am but do you do for corporations or mainly	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
oh do you oh	3717	A
so what what do they think the corporation you work with	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah well i tell you i- i work for a credit union so that might be a whole another topic as far as well you know how do	3717	A
what's the opinion around there about uh you know credit unions not being taxed and stuff do they do have you guys had any i don't want to say battles but	3717	A
do they uh a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff they they claim the unfair- unfair- uh unfair playing field and whatnot and	3717	A
whether or not credit unions are getting you know being treated special and do they get	3717	A
oh yeah	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
it's where they're going to tax credit unions on a state level or or just assess their more for the insurance fund	3717	A
huh yeah it's uh i don't know i want i think i've always felt that if we credit unions stick to their little niche they have that then it probably shouldn't be but it seems like more and more uh	3717	A
we're getting out into a lot of the bank territories i do not know if it is too fair or not	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
oh yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
but	3717	A
yeah they getting into business lending and things like that or yeah i the credit union i work for is one of the top the twenty- uh about the fifteenth largest and we are starting to get into that and that is where i really have my questions as to whether or not we're	3717	A
you know if they were able were playing on a level field whereas the banks are getting taxed and stuff	3717	A
and i don't know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed there's no doubt about it	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean we've talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or	3717	A
yeah that's true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but	3717	A
maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah that's more or less touchy-feely thing as opposed to	3717	A
yeah i just always heard that the poor would end- end up taking the worst brunt of it because they're	3717	A
you know their their income is less and yet they're being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know i've heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that it'll be maybe a different level of tax but	3717	A
seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldn't do much anyway	3717	A
um-hum	3717	A
yeah that's true	3717	A
yeah that's true	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
well uh	3717	A
are the taxes in in Texas are they are few state taxes very high or	3717	A
oh don't you oh that's sweet	3717	A
oh that hurts	3717	A
yeah it is	3717	A
how do you feel about it	3717	B
uh i'm a tax lawyer and uh i uh	3717	B
but i agree with you i uh	3717	B
i-	3717	B
um-hum	3717	B
yeah corporations i work for a bank	3717	B
yeah and uh	3717	B
and	3717	B
um	3717	B
well banks banks are regulated of course by the uh by the federal government anyway so	3717	B
we don't have the franchise taxes	3717	B
which are	3717	B
are not federal taxes uh	3717	B
i don't know i- i think they i don't hear anything at work about them really	3717	B
oh okay	3717	B
we've had that too because of the failures though	3717	B
and uh whether or not they should be assessed more	3717	B
and uh the the state has uh has uh is in the midst of a reform probably in that area	3717	B
or or higher assessment to yeah	3717	B
right	3717	B
uh i don't know that it is fair i think that it's you know the way banking is being uh compacted i work for at Nations Bank which has just merged with C and S Sovran	3717	B
and uh	3717	B
you know i think i think a little competition is good	3717	B
uh	3717	B
but down here a lot we saw we say them_1 doing things they shouldn't be doing	3717	B
yeah real estate	3717	B
yeah	3717	B
everybody's gone down i think the individual levels are fine	3717	B
uh i don't think they're perceived as uh	3717	B
was i learned in school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a hundred thousand dollars you know	3717	B
uh we wouldn't reduce the deficit by	3717	B
but but a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that	3717	B
well that's what sales tax are	3717	B
that uh flat taxes i think are a pretty good idea uh they're debating of course right now whether to bring in capital gains again uh to stimulate the economy	3717	B
and uh find from what i from what i recall it doesn't stimulate the economy that much it just uh boots everybody's feeling about stimulating the economy	3717	B
yeah	3717	B
the	3717	B
i- i what happens is i think it is a good idea but they chip away at it i mean the home mortgage deduction is like sacrosanct	3717	B
you can't take away people that said there you go you've got one exception already and uh and uh it you know well if we didn't have this exception then we'll just add this one and it just gets it snowballs	3717	B
i- i think it is in theory probably a good idea	3717	B
we don't have state income tax	3717	B
none	3717	B
but we've got an eight percent state sales tax	3717	B
yeah and uh you know course that's	3717	B
that's a regressive tax	3717	B
and it's you know uh	3717	B
uh it's not on grocery	3717	B
well today it's uh we're not doing much with it because_1 it's kind of raining outside but or snowing actually uh	3787	B
but um actually my husband is in the other room um planning a um organic garden or organic treatment um	3787	B
yeah do you do a lot of lawn work	3787	B
um-hum	3787	B
well there was a time when my husband had had- had traveled a lot and um	3787	B
we haven't been treating it as well you know using fertilizer and stuff or i guess the lawn looks okay it's just that we don't we still have a problem with weeds	3787	B
and	3787	B
but the thing that he is wanting to try this year is um using some organic treatments and	3787	B
we're not real naturalists or anything but um	3787	B
um but uh um so he wants to try doing some you know different kind of stuff i don't really know what it involves or um um	3787	B
at this point in time i enjoyed having the service when we did um	3787	B
what service did you use	3787	B
Lawn Doctor	3787	B
hm	3787	B
yeah we tried using Chem Lawn but um our problem is our front yard is completely different from the backyard	3787	B
and um i think they just use the same stuff on everything because_1 we've got a mixture our front yard is um all Bermuda what's not weeds	3787	B
and the backyard is a mixture of Saint Augustine Bermuda and some type of uh winter grass that stays green all all winter	3787	B
yeah something like that it's real clumpy and	3787	B
yeah	3787	B
oh do you do you ever- do you ever double sod or um whatever-	3787	B
you know where they mix the seed	3787	B
yeah yeah i think that's our problem is that we we just need to get it fertilized really good so that we can get the grass- grass growing rather than the weeds	3787	B
um in the front yard not so much we have a lot-	3787	B
so how's your lawn and garden work	3787	A
yeah i understand that it actually is snowing cold and wet	3787	A
oh is he okay_1	3787	A
not so much anymore i'm i'm getting older i'm fifty two now so i've just uh i've sort of slowed down you know we use this rather than do it ourselves as far as fertilizing i utilize a service and i guess they do a an okay type of job	3787	A
but uh and i've let this little kid that lives behind us cut our grass just a little bit this past year i think i'm gonna let him do it all this year just	3787	A
i work uh i'm out of town quite a bit and i come home and seems like every Friday that's what i have to face on Saturday is doing my lawn so i just stopped doing that	3787	A
right	3787	A
oh i understand yeah we- yeah we have a problem about_1 every other year with weeds it it appears that every other year a service can get rid of them and uh but just- just about every other year they come back	3787	A
it's a constant battle i tell you	3787	A
right	3787	A
i understand	3787	A
i do too so i'm have the same problem	3787	A
right	3787	A
right	3787	A
right	3787	A
with a thirty five dollar bill well- well we didn't use one year before last a service because we we had weeds like two years in a row and you know when you when you have a service you don't expect that so	3787	A
we stopped and i sort of did it myself year before last then this last summer i'd went back to a service and then went but went to a new service and they appear to have be doing a better job	3787	A
Lawn Doctor	3787	A
and we used to use one in Plano and we switched to one that's more local	3787	A
one of our friends bought the one in Plano they just didn't uh didn't do that good a job on our lawn so we changed services	3787	A
right	3787	A
right	3787	A
right either rye or something	3787	A
yeah you can see i have we have a lot of trees in our yard so it's a it's you know during the summer it's bare under the trees so i've planted a lot- planted a lot of rye- winter rye to grow because that will grow in the summertime under trees	3787	A
it's more of a shade- it's a better shade grass so now as as cold as it is out there and as rainy as it is we have you can see where we planted all the green grass but as it's in the summer because_1 that's- that's the only green area in our lawn	3787	A
all of our Bermuda's all brown	3787	A
we have on the side yard few years back right	3787	A
i'm always uh you know sometimes i'm sometimes i'm i'm over at Home Depot i'll just a grab a grass- a thing of of grass seed and put it in the old	3787	A
spreader and just spread it real quick or throw it out in the areas where i think i need it but overall i guess we have a pretty good stand of grass they say in the summertime the hotter it is the better the Bermuda grows and course that supposedly quote will crowd out the weeds and everything so	3787	A
so i just	3787	A
right how about_1 how about_1 flowers you have you have nice flowers in your front yard	3787	A
what are you cooking for supper	3857	A
that sounds pretty good	3857	A
what type of food	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
well i'm kind of a house husband and and i cook everyday	3857	A
it's about the only thing that	3857	A
huh	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
and	3857	A
today i made a banana cream pie my wife gets testy if i don't have some sort of dessert in the house	3857	A
yeah sometimes i i make things and they don't work so i kind of throw them_1 away before anybody sees them_1	3857	A
but i'm a i i don't know i live out of cookbooks other than stuff that i've cooked over and over and over	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
sometimes i like to get a hold of a very hard book uh	3857	A
and hard recipes especially some of the French dishes	3857	A
and where i've got to read it reread it and then keep it out while i'm cooking	3857	A
and you know something new not something i'm going to fix every day or something	3857	A
right	3857	A
but i guess i know for like twenty years i my wife and i both been fixing a a chicken dish from the Philippines and	3857	A
it's really really strong with garlic and black pepper and	3857	A
we've always thought nobody would like it	3857	A
and uh	3857	A
we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe	3857	A
yeah and i didn't go easy on anything	3857	A
yeah it's it's delicious it's like when it when it's like birthday time and you say well what do you want to eat we always say Chicken Adobo and	3857	A
it's just it's very pungent thing and and we just didn't think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and i've already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so	3857	A
maybe	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
where did you grow up in the Midwest	3857	A
okay	3857	A
right	3857	A
uh	3857	A
i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks they're they're from Midwest from Iowa from her background	3857	A
because that's where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area	3857	A
so it's especially when we're baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know they've been tried and tested and and everything so	3857	A
yeah uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and	3857	A
uh no we lived up at Los Alamos	3857	A
so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh	3857	A
Santa Fe type dishes and uh	3857	A
that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they uh they expect it	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
we don't even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants around here	3857	A
yeah well	3857	A
in this part of the world there's you know there's a lot and there's some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so	3857	A
you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe	3857	A
that i'd rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
oh boy that's a good question i haven't figured that one out yet	3857	B
personally i'm thinking of making a goulash	3857	B
but i'm publishing a cookbook right now so or getting it ready to go to the publisher	3857	B
all types	3857	B
different nationalities there's going to be a different section for each nationality	3857	B
it ranges anywhere from Midwestern cooking to Japanese	3857	B
there's some Scottish- there's some Scottish in it some Scottish dishes that i know some Russian some for babies you know how to make baby food instead of buying it because it's so bloody expensive	3857	B
i'm a housewife	3857	B
i'm a housewife	3857	B
everyday too	3857	B
i've got two little boys	3857	B
yeah i made banana bread two days ago and it's gone	3857	B
everything i make disappears real quick so i guess people like it	3857	B
yeah well see a lot of people do live by cookbooks not just house husbands but like bachelors and stuff they don't know how to cook anything you know unless they have a recipe to follow	3857	B
that's why i'm publishing this cookbook because it's simple recipes	3857	B
it's nothing that's hard	3857	B
it's just everything in it is really simple	3857	B
you are	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
just something for a special occasion	3857	B
oh really	3857	B
that must have made you feel good	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
huh	3857	B
well my husband went to chef school before we got married and he can cook all kinds of fancy dishes and i can because i went to cooking school too but i	3857	B
i favor the Midwestern kind of cooking because i grew up country so that's what i like to	3857	B
well i grew up in Arizona	3857	B
on a ranch- on a ranch and it was a horse ranch and we cooked country style you know i mean you don't peel your potatoes when you cook them in the country you just cut them up and there you go	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
yep	3857	B
well my mom published a cookbook when she was married to my dad which was about ten years ago	3857	B
but um	3857	B
and she published hers so now it's my turn	3857	B
i'm trying my luck	3857	B
anywhere near Alamogordo	3857	B
oh	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
there's some really good food that comes out of there i'll tell you	3857	B
there is none around here that's really Mexican	3857	B
they're all fake	3857	B
you know and when you taste the food you know it	3857	B
there's just a difference	3857	B
oh really	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
well i live in San Diego and it's right near the border	3857	B
but you'd be surprised how fake the restaurants are out here they	3857	B
knowing how close we are to the border i mean you only have to drive five minutes to get to the border	3857	B
you'd think that there'd be good Mexican cooking here	3857	B
the last family reunion i did not plan i only participated and enjoyed about two years ago	3817	B
how about_1 you	3817	B
it often depends how far you want to go back on- on our particular family reunion they went back to my great-great-grandfather	3817	B
so that it was quite um spread out and there were many families um and there were many people we didn't know i think the total participation i don't know how many were invited but there were about two hundred and fifty people there	3817	B
and some of the families one of the cutest things that some of the the families- families did was to get T-shirts that identified themselves as that branch of the family	3817	B
it was fun	3817	B
actually he was not he has gone but they decided to go ahead and take the family reunion back that far so that it wouldn't just be people meeting third cousins but people meeting i guess	3817	B
whatever fifth and seventh cousins	3817	B
and the other thing that i thought was particularly fun was uh the huge they had a huge family tree uh that was posted so you could sort of everybody could sort of see who married whom and	3817	B
so that was fun	3817	B
you know in every family there's usually one person that is gifted to do these things i have a cousin who never marries who is a librarian sounds like a bad novel	3817	B
um and she did she was she's always been interested in genealogy and she's kind of kept track and so	3817	B
um i think she just started out writing to	3817	B
key people in the different branches of families and asking them to contact everyone and i really on the family tree there really was everyone except there was just some one group that had sort of gotten lost	3817	B
in Missouri but this is was in Indiana and it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in one area	3817	B
so it wasn't like they were necessarily from all over the country but	3817	B
we're a good Catholic German stock and so yes	3817	B
the original family that i eluded to my great-grandfather had twelve children and they had some pictures of that- that was another thing they did that i thought was fun	3817	B
sounds like the twelve tribes of Israel or something	3817	B
that's always true they remember most the games they had lots of games and competitions which were fun well are you planning a family reunion	3817	B
oh	3817	B
do you how your relatives- you're from San you're in San Francisco	3817	B
sometimes when you've moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be	3817	B
this is a little office	3817	B
that sounds	3817	B
typical	3817	B
i never knew that i- i always i thought the children- like the children of your first cousins i always called those second cousins and my children and my cousins' children i called third cousins	3817	B
that's how i've always named it some people have this once removed stuff and i don't know what that means	3817	B
they'd just be your great-aunts great-aunt your grandparents' siblings would be your great aunts and uncles	3817	B
and	3817	B
so but it it is interesting sometimes a little sad when families branch out quite so much but i don't know that's the American way	3817	B
i had two distant relatives who lived in the Dallas Fort Worth area that- that i never had met and didn't know they were here and we we all laughed how it was funny to go back to Indiana to meet people who lived	3817	B
ten miles from you so that was sort of funny in fact one of them it's like my father-	3817	B
i don't remember how this was i guess it was actually just my father's cousin so it's not all that far away turns out he even goes to our church here in Dallas so	3817	B
planned a family reunion recently	3817	A
you know i really haven't and i know of friends who've done it recently and have really enjoyed um	3817	A
the the planning process but uh most of our family see each other fairly frequently so it's it's uh you know not a a major event to to try and plan it because we're all fairly close um	3817	A
that's wonderful	3817	A
oh that's great	3817	A
so your great-grandfather was still living and everyone up to that point was invited	3817	A
uh-huh wow	3817	A
uh-huh	3817	A
that's wonderful two hundred people who organized it who was the one that instigated the the planning process	3817	A
i was gonna ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was	3817	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3817	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3817	A
now given the size of the group were there people were most of the families fairly large is that what contributed to that	3817	A
that's great	3817	A
that's wonderful i'm sure that was a wonderful experience for the kids too and even if they didn't appreciate it at the moment they'll probably really appreciate it later	3817	A
no uh uh	3817	A
yeah my folks uh moved from Michigan to San Diego and that's where they raised the three of us my daughter my sisters and myself	3817	A
but uh	3817	A
i would expect yeah yeah	3817	A
and i know that my grandparents' families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother	3817	A
so we've kept in touch those first cousins very pretty closely um i'm not quite sure how i'd even pursue finding the rest of the folks in Michigan	3817	A
i think i think each of my grandparents had ten siblings	3817	A
so	3817	A
there's got to be a few of those second does that make second cousin or third cousin i'm not sure	3817	A
oh okay okay	3817	A
so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great	3817	A
aunts and uncles	3817	A
right right	3817	A
did you find that you had a lot in common did people find out things about each other that they hadn't been aware	3817	A
really	3817	A
uh-huh	3817	A
do you um have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting	3813	A
um-hum	3813	A
yeah	3813	A
oh well we don't have a real strict budget um	3813	A
we have a a low budget to work on but we um you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we- we just spend about so much we don't	3813	A
i- i don't know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there	3813	A
a certain amount	3813	A
yeah	3813	A
oh	3813	A
wow that's great	3813	A
oh	3813	A
oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient	3813	A
hm	3813	A
yeah well that's a good idea	3813	A
let's see the the other thing there the topic was talking about was	3813	A
if you if i don't all i can think of is if you don't keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses but um	3813	A
one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas well not fly back but somehow we get back there	3813	A
and um this year we did it by train because_1 it was the least expensive and	3813	A
huh oh yeah	3813	A
and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare	3813	A
and so um	3813	A
we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and	3813	A
entertainment things like that then um	3813	A
somewhere in out in the wash it'll come out that we have enough to get back there you know	3813	A
uh-huh that's right	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
uh-huh that's right	3813	A
yeah well whenever i don't know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will i'll probably pick it up	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
yeah i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in count it up at the end of the year something	3813	A
but yeah	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
well for many many years uh	3813	B
my wife and i did have a budget uh we were both working at the time and so forth	3813	B
and um	3813	B
that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of	3813	B
uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation	3813	B
so it it's uh it's been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of	3813	B
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did	3813	B
sure uh-huh	3813	B
um-hum	3813	B
i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh	3813	B
you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i- i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there	3813	B
as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that	3813	B
yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff	3813	B
and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal- personal storage	3813	B
well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall when- if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up	3813	B
so it's it's worked very well that way at least that way we you know if each of us finds something is missing	3813	B
uh we put it up uh the other person might not know about it	3813	B
that way we can keep up to date	3813	B
uh-huh	3813	B
well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
sure well i think we unconsciously do the same thing excuse me my throat's not as clear today as it should be	3813	B
uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks	3813	B
tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money	3813	B
so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip	3813	B
so that- that is another way of uh budgeting	3813	B
and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we don't throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice	3813	B
i do the same thing i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
well let's face it then when we talking budget	3813	B
it is important to to have a budget and uh i- i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the	3813	B
level of my checking- checking account and i have a money market account also	3813	B
and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum	3813	B
and i'm always trying to	3813	B
hello	3862	A
hi my name is Dolphene i live in Texas	3862	A
okay i work for TI do do you also okay	3862	A
oh okay uh you're ready to begin	3862	A
oh okay	3862	A
okay	3862	A
yes	3862	A
well i don't think that uh any of my relatives would really like to go there	3862	A
i- i believe that if i am in a position uh like when my mother	3862	A
gets to the- to a point where she needs special care that i'll be able to	3862	A
just bring her into my home	3862	A
and my father also and um	3862	A
or have someone go into their home you know and um and look after them	3862	A
that way	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
you right it's it's basically it's more how they feel about it because_1 it's like they have feel they feel like they're they're um	3862	A
my- the way my mother would put it like somebody had {throwed} them_1 away you know	3862	A
right	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
um-hum and another- another thing to think about um on the positive side of the nursing homes there	3862	A
i used to work uh in one of the offices in a nursing home and i got to see a lot of the things that that they did	3862	A
they um they had a lot of crafts	3862	A
and they had a lot of games	3862	A
and uh they get together and they just do they they do all sorts of things and then there's some of- some of the uh	3862	A
the people that are that are in there	3862	A
are real nice- you know very very nice and friendly to everybody	3862	A
and uh then there are others that are it's a just just a job and they just you know wanna go in and do what they have to do and get out and go home um	3862	A
the the attitude of the staff as you said is- is is really uh very very important	3862	A
right	3862	A
right	3862	A
yeah	3862	A
um yeah	3862	A
well it's like well- the one that i worked in um you would see some of them_1 uh just	3862	A
like in wheelchairs all day they'd just roll- roll themselves around all over the place and	3862	A
and they would enjoy themselves with activities and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group and they they just	3862	A
didn't like participate together with the others because they they had some some uh	3862	A
i guess slight- a slight mental disabilities and things like um what what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that they just don't don't um	3862	A
they weren't really together with the rest of them_1 when they got together for such activities	3862	A
hello	3862	B
hi my name is Pat Johnson and i live in Texas too	3862	B
no	3862	B
no i live in Dallas i work for the Dallas school system	3862	B
we might as well	3862	B
understand we're doing care of the elderly right	3862	B
and how do you feel about putting someone in a nursing home	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yes i would find it very difficult uh to place	3862	B
either- my father or my stepmother	3862	B
ah in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it	3862	B
yes	3862	B
yes i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you're faced with placing someone	3862	B
um in a place like that uh you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that's offered and such but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference	3862	B
and i have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and- have no family who could care- you know care for her	3862	B
and uh i know that uh the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about uh her situation	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yes	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yeah	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
i think it would matter too uh the kinds of uh	3862	B
disabilities	3862	B
that	3862	B
the nursing home accepts	3862	B
because there are some uh	3862	B
who poor things you know don't have uh any real grasp on reality any longer	3862	B
and they may be ambulatory but they tend to behave like children small children	3862	B
and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to have- to have to deal with on a daily basis	3862	B
ooh	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yes	3862	B
um-hum um-hum	3862	B
yes	3862	B
yeah Alzheimer's yes	3862	B
yes and that can	3862	B
uh well yeah i am as a matter of fact well actually- actually i'm looking for another car but uh uh new probably not	3815	B
uh sports car uh usually either black or red	3815	B
and- and electric windows and power locks no	3815	B
well uh not so much that as it is i've had so many times when uh uh you know i- i'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody	3815	B
uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window	3815	B
it is just a real pain or you know if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them_1 it's real difficult to drive reach- reach over and try to roll down the window	3815	B
and uh so power locks and power windows are just just things that uh uh just really help a lot what about you	3815	B
oh	3815	B
sure	3815	B
have you ever had a car with an air bag	3815	B
no	3815	B
well it it seems- sure seems to save lives and uh yeah i actually i like the antilock brakes	3815	B
and i've never had a chance to i have been in cars that have had them but i've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up	3815	B
but uh you think you'd buy uh an American car or a European or Japanese	3815	B
what was that	3815	B
huh stick shift huh did it have what a three speed or a four speed	3815	B
wow	3815	B
well actually i much prefer a stick shift	3815	B
and what i'm i'm curious i- i know why i love a stick shift why do you why did you want one	3815	B
um-hum	3815	B
it's hard to find stick shift cars anymore	3815	B
huh	3815	B
yeah no i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift	3815	B
huh	3815	B
huh	3815	B
um i guess i- i grew up on it and it's fun it's it's an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control	3815	B
over the car and it- it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and ice and slick conditions	3815	B
uh it- it- it does uh i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun	3815	B
yeah yeah	3815	B
well are you in the market for a new car	3815	A
oh what sort of requirements to you have for your car	3815	A
uh-huh	3815	A
um	3815	A
i see	3815	A
top of top of the line	3815	A
oh	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
right right	3815	A
um-hum um-hum	3815	A
well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like power- power windows or power locks because the people that i know have- who have them_1 always seem to have trouble with them	3815	A
and um so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and	3815	A
uh i guess a good	3815	A
no i haven't have you	3815	A
somehow i just think you know i like the idea	3815	A
right	3815	A
right that's a good idea	3815	A
um-hum um-hum	3815	A
well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i- i guess i did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record	3815	A
good mileage um	3815	A
and i needed air-conditioning and um	3815	A
can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift	3815	A
and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that	3815	A
you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a Chrysler um	3815	A
Lancer	3815	A
yeah	3815	A
no a five speed and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it	3815	A
so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move	3815	A
well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable	3815	A
um	3815	A
i found that out i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement	3815	A
so	3815	A
yeah	3815	A
well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports cars but now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift	3815	A
and so why do you like stick shift	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
right right	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
right and actually it's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active	3815	A
so	3815	A
so	3833	A
um i did until my company went bankrupt	3833	A
yeah now right now i haven't been able to locate a job down here in Patterson	3833	A
it's kind of a small	3833	A
city so	3833	A
i've been going to Modesto which is larger but it's not like being in the Bay area where i came from	3833	A
you know	3833	A
but anyhow when i did work in the winter time i wore uh my wool skirts and sweaters and boots	3833	A
because the Bay area gets kind of chilly in the winter time	3833	A
and um then in the summer time i just wore you know the polyester blouses and usually- usually pants and just uh heels you know	3833	A
so uh where do you work at	3833	A
oh okay	3833	A
right	3833	A
you do you i don't suppose you can wear pants	3833	A
oh because i never see anybody in the banks out here it seems like i never see them_1 with pants on	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
no no i haven't	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
oh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
oh really	3833	A
isn't that	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
hum	3833	A
yeah that would be interesting to do um i worked for a trucking company so we didn't really even have to dress up at all if we didn't want to we could wear pants all the time you know	3833	A
but uh i just in the winter time i just like to wear boots and you know the wool skirts and the sweaters and everything	3833	A
but uh i've never gone to and had a you know	3833	A
anything like that done to tell me exactly what color i would look best in	3833	A
uh i know i don't look good in yellow but i like pink and blue you know and red	3833	A
but uh i just look in the mirror and	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
um-hum um-hum	3833	A
uh-huh huh very interesting	3833	A
so do you have your do you like like do you in Dallas do you wear wool in the winter time or	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
um	3833	A
um-hum and naturally it gets real hot in the summertime i suppose yeah	3833	A
yeah yeah it gets hot here in Patterson in the summer time more so than it did in the Bay area you know um like here	3833	A
uh like um a hundred and twenty six miles from Fresno	3833	A
but in the valley north	3833	A
right	3833	A
right uh-huh	3833	A
oh i see uh-huh so you have came to California though do you have family-	3833	A
uh do you work outside the home	3833	B
oh poor baby	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
um-hum	3833	B
oh yeah	3833	B
um-hum	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
i work for a bank and uh i have to dress somewhat more formally	3833	B
so i- i look like the little old lady preppie	3833	B
uh no i- i guess i could but i don't	3833	B
no no we don't wear pants uh i- i wear suits	3833	B
uh almost exclusively	3833	B
have you ever had a uh a color analysis	3833	B
uh	3833	B
well it's a very interesting process	3833	B
uh according to the lady that did mine she called them_1 summer and winter	3833	B
and uh spring and fall and the summer she said you could call them A B C D or one two three four or whatever	3833	B
but there are people that look better in the cool colors	3833	B
than than the other people look better in the earth and warm colors	3833	B
and uh most people are summers or winters	3833	B
and uh	3833	B
uh it's really an interesting process and i found out i was a summer so i look much better in the the blues pinks	3833	B
uh	3833	B
the the winters uh wear stronger colors	3833	B
but basically the same types of colors but as a summer i'm not supposed to wear uh black or stark white	3833	B
uh	3833	B
the winters- just winters wear black and white and the summer uh the spring and and fall colors wear well i have a daughter in law that uh	3833	B
uh this the the camouflage colors the khakis and the olive drab green	3833	B
just make her eyes light up like crazy yeah and then i- i also have a daughter in law who has auburn hair	3833	B
so she wears the earth colors uh the oranges and the olive drab greens and the khakis and and uh they're most becoming to her so it it it it really is an interesting	3833	B
analysis	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah uh-huh	3833	B
yeah well reds uh i i have to have a red that leans towards the the blue uh in other words it leans toward the maroon	3833	B
but the reds that lead lean toward the orange don't do a thing for me	3833	B
so i have to be careful about reds	3833	B
oh yeah oh yeah uh we have thirty nine- an average of thirty nine days when it gets down below freezing and as a general rule at least oh	3833	B
oh two or three days at a time during the winter we'll either have uh ice covered streets or two or three inches of snow	3833	B
so uh i- i wear woolens quite a bit	3833	B
oh yeah oh yeah it gets very warm in the summertime	3833	B
yeah yeah uh-huh	3833	B
are are you over toward Fresno	3833	B
uh south	3833	B
oh north oh i see i have not been i have not been north of of uh	3833	B
uh what is it uh Interstate Eighty that goes from Sacramento to San Francisco	3833	B
i have not been north of that highway	3833	B
yes uh-huh	3833	B
okay	3852	B
well Larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and and	3852	B
a couple of ladies ran a stop light the lights weren't working properly it wasn't their fault but we they didn't run it we both had green and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car so	3852	B
that was a huge repair bill	3852	B
i know i hated that	3852	B
so it wasn't enough to total it but that's my that's been my most uh	3852	B
expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years and	3852	B
well i travel a lot so you know uh this last one i leased so i don't know and i leased it on a twenty four month program it's the first time i've ever done that but i'll probably go back to buying them_1 because i don't care to lease them_1	3852	B
no it has the expanding balloons	3852	B
uh it they didn't go off	3852	B
no i guess we weren't going that sort of upset me we weren't going fast enough according- when i called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it but no sir didn't go off uh we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day and	3852	B
and the street lights	3852	B
yes	3852	B
yes	3852	B
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything i tell you just	3852	B
took it all off it was uh uh my my doors were okay front and back and	3852	B
but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage it was a expensive- then i get it back and two weeks after that i'm driving it in front of the local high school	3852	B
and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage so	3852	B
so i'm gonna get rid- my twenty four months is up on this car i'm getting rid of this car	3852	B
my golly how about_1 you Larry	3852	B
i understand	3852	B
i understand	3852	B
sure	3852	B
well- i understand that because i'm from West Virginia and we had the same thing up there continuously- continuously salting the roads for snow	3852	B
sure	3852	B
no i'm gonna i'm gonna buy it Larry i don't like the rental i think i'm getting ready to retire myself and i'm going to i'm going to be you know driving a car for longer so i usually drive a car	3852	B
for three years and and anyway and	3852	B
so but last couple cars i've only driven for two years so i'd leased this one for two years so i'll probably go back and buy one and uh this next car -will probably be my retirement car	3852	B
well- no sir not really not really uh	3852	B
no problem at all my wife and daughter we have uh two Toyotas in the family one Nissan and we have the Lincoln and uh the not really no problem there at all as finding- as far as finding parking places it's it's convenient in that in that regard	3852	B
yes it is and i'm and i travel i'm like a traveling salesman don't travel a lot any more but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive	3852	B
yes	3852	B
is that right	3852	B
-well my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old it only has doesn't even have thirty miles- thirty thousand miles on it so gosh been much in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car	3852	B
okay_1 Ron welcome to the net and uh what did you do about your last auto repair oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth	3852	A
um	3852	A
my goodness gracious that's	3852	A
well that's still not enough for a total is it	3852	A
to get it's a very expensive automobile	3852	A
oh and do you buy one every two years	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had	3852	A
did that help you	3852	A
they didn't go off	3852	A
well what-	3852	A
but you were hit in the side weren't you	3852	A
that may be the problem you you might- you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to uh activate it	3852	A
my goodness	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
my goodness	3852	A
i would think so that doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one	3852	A
well i'm relatively fortunate about that uh here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities	3852	A
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they don't have to drive that way here and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle	3852	A
and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time	3852	A
uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh and i drive a Honda most of the time	3852	A
and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
well i just i did- i had this Cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders	3852	A
uh done and then it all repainted and then winter got here and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off so i haven't had a chance to drive it very much	3852	A
but anyhow uh uh now are you gonna buy this next car or you going rent it a lease again	3852	A
are you	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
well that's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the Lincoln uh isn't it too large for normal town driving	3852	A
finding parking places and getting in and out the doors	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
ah	3852	A
yeah	3852	A
well- well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips	3852	A
i'm i'm very much aware of that	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
yes i'm sure it is because that's the way that i enjoy this Pontiac that i have it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine	3852	A
um-hum do you do you feel that uh	3852	A
well um i had planned a very successful cousins reunion i have a lot of cousins and i did that several years ago in fact it was so well received they've been really having a fit for me to do it again	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
good	3897	B
oh how neat	3897	B
uh-huh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over several-	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum well that's kind of nice to be able to do that to- for both occasions my my uh family	3897	B
um my father's family uh he had five or six oh i let see six brothers and sisters	3897	B
and uh when my grandmother died we found that we were not getting together except um just when somebody died	3897	B
it was only funerals and so it was kind of sad so about i guess it was about two or three years ago i planed this cousins reunion and how i my my cousins even though we're all	3897	B
fairly close there's only two or three of them that's out of town and out of state	3897	B
uh i we didn't keep in close contact and there were sometimes well let's see one one family had five and one family had four children and the rest of us were you know like two and three	3897	B
and uh	3897	B
so i just sent to the oldest child in each you know uh in each family	3897	B
uh my oldest cousin in every family to uh to send me their	3897	B
brother's and sister's names and addresses and their names of their spouses	3897	B
and i got good- pretty good response from that had to do a little phone work and then i just sent out a real neat little memo to everybody	3897	B
and one of the cousins helped cook the meat- the meat and everybody brought a dish	3897	B
and uh i it just worked out really really well	3897	B
oh my word	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
well i- i can imagine it's hard to get that many people together	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
oh shoot well how often do you all do you have- try to have like reunion	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum oh well that's that would be fun uh-huh	3897	B
uh-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
well i don't know about you but neighborhoods just aren't like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that that is really neat	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
oh sure and and to find out what happened to everybody right um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
well one of the fun things i did was when i sent out my invitations i mean they weren't like invitations i just did it on a	3897	B
on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my cousins um when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage	3897	B
on on that you know and just just printed it on uh a real good copy machine uh you know you they weren't really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it	3897	B
and everybody got a big kick out of that because_1 there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had had	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
oh that would be fun- uh was that it wasn't- that wasn't a genealogy book or	3897	B
it was it was different than that	3897	B
go ahead Vickie	3897	A
um-hum	3897	A
i've never actually got to plan one but i've came to several back here in Tennessee that uh were planned long distance with people you know because_1 my immediate family is like five states	3897	A
and they've all turned out pretty good and this time we're here for my mother's eighty fifth birthday	3897	A
and we had a big dinner today about thirty people and	3897	A
uh well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephew's one of my nephew's is getting married so	3897	A
a lot of people came from well to Florida Virginia and Texas and Tennessee here for that for both occasions	3897	A
so it's been	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
i i'm actually one of sixteen kids so and only nine of those kids belong to my mother	3897	A
and they were all here in Tennessee today the first time we have all been together for a snap shot in	3897	A
well forever it's been in my memory yeah	3897	A
the last time we had a legitimate family reunion one of the sisters couldn't make it so	3897	A
everybody had pictures of everybody together but her	3897	A
so today we	3897	A
well	3897	A
it's kind of like your family sometimes it's just funerals and and and special occasions but the last family reunion was in eighty five and i'd like to see another one get going	3897	A
i was going to you know now that the subjects been brought up uh about five years ago it was- actually i didn't get to attend this but i was so wanting to but several of my sisters had got together with some other people in the neighborhood we grew up in	3897	A
and we had a community park and of course we all rode the same buses and stuff and they had a block- or like a community reunion and	3897	A
i didn't get to attend because i was in the process of moving to Texas over that same weekend and uh but they said you know it was a blast and they sent me pictures	3897	A
it was you know people we grew up with and uh people came from all over the place to get back for that one	3897	A
yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but uh i'd like to see i'd still like to see them_1 yeah	3897	A
well at the time you know all i could do was tell them hey well Sam's moving from New Mexico to Texas and this that and so- the other so	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
um-hum	3897	A
hum a few years ago my wife's family and they're off in a little town in Missouri and uh	3897	A
they planned it for several years and actually had a book made of peoples stories and where people went and photographs that went back about two hundred years and uh and of course	3897	A
it was no it each each family that lived in	3897	A
what what you have some ideas on the to help out the President here	3881	A
right i- i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at	3881	A
right people get get where they depend on the the benefit and they don't have much interest and there is no uh	3881	A
uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesn't get continued there's there's a lot of waste as a result i think of that	3881	A
yeah	3881	A
yeah	3881	A
well uh i	3881	A
yeah i think there's uh there's a good opportunity if they'll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh	3881	A
if and combine the savings there with with the savings in	3881	A
all these uh give away programs and and then waste that's in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just	3881	A
continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that don't do any good	3881	A
well there was a there was a study i don't know if you heard of it it was the Grace Commission	3881	A
uh and it it he was uh a private uh individual and he did a study on on cutting waste out of government and he came up with	3881	A
i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on	3881	A
uh-huh	3881	A
right yeah you wonder if all that is necessary and that's the same in government i guess it's is it all necessary	3881	A
yeah yeah it it perpetuates a lot more jobs i think is what it does	3881	A
but but	3881	A
uh-huh	3881	A
yeah well	3881	A
well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and that's something the government has never really tried hard to do uh	3881	A
they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have	3881	A
uh there's no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when you're going into debt to do it	3881	A
uh	3881	B
i think that uh one of the things they're going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at what's important and what has a return on investment	3881	B
uh there's an awful lot of federal programs that uh	3881	B
they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good	3881	B
and there's some things some programs that just don't seem to be working at all	3881	B
uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs they're just seem to be self perpetuating	3881	B
and uh	3881	B
uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved	3881	B
just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them_1 no incentive whatever to to solve their own problems	3881	B
well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh	3881	B
they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family	3881	B
so that's resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare	3881	B
and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around	3881	B
and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing	3881	B
i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation	3881	B
I know that	3881	B
um-hum	3881	B
yeah	3881	B
well i know that uh	3881	B
well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator	3881	B
and work out a a one or two page cost proposal	3881	B
and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program	3881	B
we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh of nonsense to for somebody to go read	3881	B
you know	3881	B
and uh you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do why	3881	B
and	3881	B
uh and i- i think one of the problems we're having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh	3881	B
when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor	3881	B
and now it seems like there's uh as many administrators and administrative assistants as we have teachers	3881	B
and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent	3881	B
um-hum	3881	B
and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things	3881	B
uh we have a	3881	B
a new sewage treatment facility near here	3881	B
that's uh one of the fine EPA approved things that does a super job of cleaning up the water	3881	B
and they have an administrative building associated with it	3881	B
that uh has-	3881	B
uh i mean i guess i get it most people i get it from uh the paper and the TV and	3866	B
i guess probably now the TV first paper second and- radio third	3866	B
yeah i was just kind of think of the order you know but uh	3866	B
yeah	3866	B
yeah i think it's uh i don't know i mean	3866	B
it's getting a little bit ridiculous i mean this- this i don't know if you saw it yesterday but uh	3866	B
where i was at had it on CNN and uh they had that press conference with that uh Jennifer Flowers uh Clinton's alleged uh mistress whatever and uh	3866	B
it just got to be so i mean it's ridiculous because_1 you know one of the questions was uh do did uh Clinton use a condom and all that i mean it was uh uh the whole press corp was just laughing	3866	B
right	3866	B
yeah i think i mean he probably did it i mean that's my belief i just think that you know if he did it you know he should have said so on Sixty Minutes and cause i mean American public is pretty forgiving and	3866	B
most times yeah if you do something i mean what else can you say- how can you	3866	B
well now with	3866	B
yeah but i mean the fact is now that he's left himself- the fact that he wouldn't deny it or	3866	B
confirm it was he's just left himself open to further digging from other reporters now you know there's all types of rumors now that	3866	B
Miss uh America Miss Arkansas all the way down to Miss Teen Arkansas well- allegedly had a	3866	B
thing with him i mean it's just going to keep dogging him i- i think he's going to be out of the race in two weeks just because_1 this is going to keep getting the fact that he won't confirm or deny i mean	3866	B
i mean he he's been this has been going on for years though i mean he's always had rumors and stuff and	3866	B
yeah and he	3866	B
no it's just i know it's just i think is just the fact that he uh	3866	B
he just flat out lied to the public that he didn't and it was totally proven wrong and then he challenged you know the press to you know prove it and they did and that's what killed him and Clinton on the other hand if he if he	3866	B
i mean he took a big risk just even going on TV the other night with his wife but i think his wife came off better than he did but	3866	B
in the end i think he's just going to his people now are you know the	3866	B
the fund the campaign you know they're going to wait and see what happens and you know when he keeps more stuff more stuff keeps coming out about him and then	3866	B
i think he'll be out uh you know he'll be out of the race eventually because_1 the money is what uh the only thing that matters in the end and if he doesn't have any money there's not	3866	B
oh yeah she she's a bimbo i mean you know	3866	B
the	3866	B
yeah but	3866	B
i don't know i mean it's just the press is always going to be like that i think and you know i mean- Americans- most i think that most people in America know	3866	B
i mean my people my age you know probably probably really don't care i mean what they i really don't you know care what they do as long as it doesn't	3866	B
but when the press says that you know some it's it's important it's got to be important because i mean they control	3866	B
i mean	3866	B
what's said and everything and	3866	B
yeah i think it's i mean yeah i think it's totally gone overboard and i mean it's issues and everything and the timing of this can-	3866	B
can be more worse for him but he he's clearly the front runner now he's about to get blown out of the water at this time	3866	B
yeah	3866	B
uh i mean he he he had i mean he had the thing won but now i mean	3866	B
i- i- i just don't think he'll be around i mean this this if you go by past history and you know he's he's dodging the subject now you know he says	3866	B
he clearly stated you know what he had to say on Sixty Minutes he didn't say anything all he said was that the American public knows that i'm mean you know	3866	B
okay what- what do you mean uh Bill and you know i'm not going to confirm or deny anything i mean that's where you	3866	B
okay	3866	A
yeah same here	3866	A
uh i hardly ever listen to news on the radio i don't even know if they have it anymore	3866	A
yeah what do you think about uh you know the second part of that question was are they doing a good job	3866	A
i'm beginning to think you know especially this week with all that stuff coming out about Clinton uh	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
i- i got a feeling that	3866	A
you know cause from- from what you know i got most of my information from the Larry King show and uh	3866	A
it was like nobody's verified her story at all and it just came from the tabloids and everybody jumped on to it	3866	A
without- and nobody's been able to verify that she's telling the truth all the only thing they know is that she lied about everything else	3866	A
would you go on national television and and uh tell the world that you'd had an affair and you know and your wife and her parents are listening and	3866	A
that would be kind of rough to do	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
i thought we were kind of through with this a few years ago when Gary Hart uh got caught messing around and	3866	A
i thought we would kind of leave private lives out of this the politics but uh	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
yeah we're waiting	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
yeah well when i heard i guess it was yesterday i heard that she'd gotten in excess over a hundred thousand dollars to talk to the this tabloid thing	3866	A
i thought well golly gee she's got to be lying i'd say i slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks you know	3866	A
maybe but	3866	A
well	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
why has the press gone overboard in telling us things and	3866	A
well if if if if somehow he clears himself from this he is all of a sudden jumped out in front	3866	A
because everybody knows his name and and knows where he's from and knows what he looks like and i'm not sure everybody knows all the other people at all	3866	A
that are	3866	A
okay well have you had to return anything lately	3889	A
uh oh	3889	A
uh-huh	3889	A
um	3889	A
yeah we haven't had to take anything back although i wonder you know if they	3889	A
sometimes i think things are made to not last as long as they used to you know so you have to buy them_1 more often uh	3889	A
and my phone is making a weird noise um	3889	A
i'm trying to think we have we just moved into our house about two years ago and we had to buy um	3889	A
refrigerator and washer and dryer and all that and so far we haven't had any	3889	A
any major problems haven't had although i keep hearing noises this morning that make me wonder if our washer is about to to uh you know	3889	A
oh uh-huh	3889	A
huh	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
oh	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
hum	3889	A
oh	3889	A
oh	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
um wow what a mess-	3889	A
yeah	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
right	3889	A
oh they could make lots of bucks that way oh we haven't had any	3889	A
we haven't had to have anything fixed like that although we do my husband orders a lot from Land's End um catalog	3889	A
yeah yeah we've we've had real good luck with them for the most part but they have changed their sizing somewhat and because_1 i had ordered a women's blouse and i wear about a six but i usually like to order the next size up	3889	A
and i had ordered a um uh one of those little polo shirts um	3889	A
and it's really pretty small and i hardly ever wear it but so i was trying to decide what size to order this time and i went ahead and ordered the same size	3889	A
well yes i did i returned a number of things yesterday at uh JC Penney but-	3889	B
but it wasn't um it was clothing	3889	B
and um	3889	B
the blouse was uh supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my shoulder and it wasn't you know the style of the blouse it just	3889	B
i think it was sized wrong but you know it was a nice blouse but and um i took some uh lingerie back that wasn't	3889	B
well i the size that i usually buy did not fit in their in their brand it was too small	3889	B
uh but as far as large items go like appliances or things like that no	3889	B
uh-huh	3889	B
um um-hum	3889	B
well uh i would like to comment on my washer um	3889	B
um my washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise	3889	B
and you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced	3889	B
but um it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really	3889	B
and i he says let me show you and i said- i said oh yeah i see that it really needs something bad you know but it didn't uh have an affect on the performance of the machine	3889	B
what what it was the um it was a cap after your um	3889	B
after the body of the machine was in place it was under that so it wasn't visible	3889	B
and it was out of sight	3889	B
and it was rusting out	3889	B
although i don't have any rust in my clothes and i said okay how much do you want to	3889	B
uh do this repair work and he told me almost two hundred and fifty dollars and i said hey i can go buy a new one for that price	3889	B
and i said- and i said no i'm not gonna do that i said the performance of the machine is not affected by that part	3889	B
and i said and that's not that's not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in	3889	B
and um so that was two years ago and my machine is still functioning fine	3889	B
so i didn't you know and he wanted thirty five dollars for a service call and i says hey wait a minute they didn't tell me that when i called and i said i'm not paying it	3889	B
i says if they had told me up front i would have paid it but since they did not say ma'am there's a thirty five dollar service call	3889	B
but they didn't and i says i refuse to pay it and so he he had called his office and told them what i said and i- i was released from that service charge	3889	B
so you know they were they to me that was underhanded i wouldn't have minded if they had said okay uh we have that service is thirty five dollars or whatever they they charge maybe it's different um	3889	B
uh charges for different things i don't know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything	3889	B
and then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever you've got wrong with your	3889	B
you write them_1	3889	B
yeah they really could	3889	B
yes	3889	B
oh they're a fantastic company to deal with	3889	B
oh uh-huh	3889	B
um-hum	3889	B
um-hum	3889	B
oh my	3889	B
oh i do um cross stitch and some needle point	3863	B
and needle- needle point and i also crochet	3863	B
yes	3863	B
uh what kind	3863	B
what kind of hobbies do you have	3863	B
oh yeah	3863	B
what kind of music do you do do you do you perform or do you	3863	B
wow	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
uh-huh	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
oh it sounds like you are busy that's almost an occupation now	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
for uh for ham radios	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
oh	3863	B
yeah i've always thought that was interesting i've never know anyone or or used a ham radio but i always thought that the concept was really interesting	3863	B
um-hum i didn't know how far of a of a distance i guess depending on what kind of aerial that you use	3863	B
yeah	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
wow	3863	B
uh-huh	3863	B
regularly	3863	B
that's exciting	3863	B
oh	3863	B
uh well actually yeah i've i've done some original work not very much in cross stitch	3863	B
but i- i did do one for my husband's mother	3863	B
and unfortunately she passed away the day i finished the day after i finished it	3863	B
and uh she never saw it she never knew anything about it	3863	B
it is and	3863	B
it's kind of spooky the	3863	B
the thing that i did i did the twenty third psalm the last verse	3863	B
and it was i presume you're familiar with that	3863	B
and uh	3863	B
yeah it's it's in uh it's one picture and it is hanging on the wall and i entered it in the State Fair of Texas under original art work and i won fourth place with it	3863	B
but i do pictures all around i've done some pictures oh i've done polar bears and sayings and i've done um uh sunsets and quite a few wedding and baby announcements	3863	B
most of them are already worked out i have worked up some but not many of them and the ones that i haven't worked out there's magazines everywhere	3863	B
and there's uh craft books and there's several designers that once you've you've been with a particular craft like this you get to know the designers and	3863	B
you end up having some favorites in the designers	3863	B
well	3863	B
well i do	3863	B
yeah but i've got uh a little baby he's there he goes he's seventeen months and uh my cross stitch time has	3863	B
good	3863	A
so what common hobbies do you have Cathy and	3863	A
cross-stitch and uh needle point uh-huh	3863	A
and you do crocheting	3863	A
my goodness i ought to have my wife here talking to you i think	3863	A
well i don't whether we can call it a hobby or not and uh many years ago music was a hobby to me	3863	A
but as i have gotten older i found out that music has taken over about half of my time	3863	A
and uh now that i'm i retired about uh not quite a month ago that'll be uh i guess uh most of my efforts	3863	A
well i i	3863	A
yes i play uh violin in um three different symphony orchestras local- a local one here in State College and then one in Altoona which is oh forty five miles away and	3863	A
and another one at the Lockhaven University which is about forty five fifty miles away	3863	A
and uh i formed what is called a State College Municipal Band oh about_1 ten fifteen years ago	3863	A
i play trumpet in that and conduct occasionally once in a while	3863	A
so i'm pretty busy in keeping that band going and trying to keep my violin playing up to uh an acceptable level of these other orchestras	3863	A
it does does take a lot of work and then when i have spare time i uh also am an amateur radio operator	3863	A
but i don't	3863	A
um-hum i have so little opportunity i am hopefully the next year or so going to uh rebuild my station and uh get back on the air a little bit more consistently	3863	A
i do have the equipment but as the antennas blew down the last few years i just went off the air and that uh that was the end of that	3863	A
it is it's it's a very interesting thing to talk to people all over the world it's what it amounts to	3863	A
depends upon the frequency and how good of an antenna you have and how conditions are about every eleven or twelve years conditions change	3863	A
so that uh you're signals get into different parts of the world	3863	A
man i have at one time or another talked almost not every country in the world but in all areas of the world	3863	A
i oh i have uh when i was really active i had well over a hundred different countries that i had talked to	3863	A
yeah um-hum fairly consistently yeah well tell me about this work that you do and uh do you display- display these sell them or uh how do uh	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
you know that sounds exactly like things that Pat does but-	3863	A
hum	3863	A
that is a shame	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
yeah and this is something that you would make into one square and hang on the wall is the way you do it uh-huh	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
where do you get the information to that enables you to do these different pictures are they already worked out so that you know	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
yeah	3863	A
hum	3863	A
well that is a very interesting thing it it is awfully nice to have something to do that that you enjoy so much you can put you soul into it so to speak	3863	A
yeah i can hear him	3863	A
so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today	3828	A
yeah that's	3828	A
no i have to i have to agree with you i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the Richardson- Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak and you know it's a shame	3828	A
a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced	3828	A
something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in uh a year	3828	A
on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a stash- stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and uh when he uses- spends-	3828	A
uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing	3828	A
now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there	3828	A
well we don't either in Texas	3828	A
well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this	3828	A
as far what goes on with our	3828	A
criminal system our judiciary-	3828	A
-judiciary system and everything else it's just uh it's terrible the way it is right now	3828	A
yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if it's uh crimes like we're just been discussing	3828	A
obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them_1 off the streets but i don't think that's gonna happen because just like you said and	3828	A
our state's a good example your state's a good example and it's just not gonna happen as far as the murderers	3828	A
and people that commit rape and things like that i'm not sure what's right but i know that it's- it's not right to put him in there and	3828	A
let- let him live for years and years and years before you do execute him or whatever because_1 it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to	3828	A
i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of TV and i'm sure they have uh	3828	A
exercise facilities and movies and and everything else you know they can	3828	A
have a good time in	3828	A
no it really isn't	3828	A
it's a big it's a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it	3828	A
so i don't know	3828	A
i'm uh i'm pretty much of a hard person uh	3828	A
i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright	3828	A
oh	3828	A
you bet i mean that's the only way to	3828	A
oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them_1 and all you know it's just unbelievable	3828	A
can you really	3828	A
gosh	3828	A
oh i know see	3828	A
meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know	3828	A
yes	3828	A
the drug problems that's another one	3828	A
well i'm	3828	B
think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people	3828	B
getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they're	3828	B
given by the court system but i don't know with the economy the way it is i think crime can't do much but go up	3828	B
right	3828	B
well there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina the average serves six weeks	3828	B
well we- see we don't have any room in our prisons so	3828	B
they shuttle- they shuttle them_1 in and shuttle them_1 out and they get them_1 get them_1 early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then they're they're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals	3828	B
and it just it it's just really absurd	3828	B
i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions	3828	B
that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because_1 they realize there's absolutely- or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it	3828	B
uh yeah	3828	B
yep	3828	B
well i don't know what the answer is but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working so	3828	B
i hope so i don't	3828	B
oh i definitely believe in capital punishment	3828	B
it's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that i don't i'm kind of curious- curious about what-	3828	B
yeah you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost- almost a period of twenty years	3828	B
yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the North Carolina Supreme Court	3828	B
and then uh after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States and that usually takes another four to six years so it's	3828	B
they're hoping i guess they're what they're hoping- they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did but it just uh	3828	B
we have a serious problem in we have so many problems in this state right now and and the the thing is the the fundamental-	3828	B
the fundamental problem is the legal- is	3828	B
okay Lee tell me about your ideas on this uh the US government supporting health insurance and so forth	3870	A
well what is this going to do to the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing uh a good job	3870	A
yes	3870	A
well this is what's bothering me Lee another question do you think that there should be some control uh innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously- ridiculously over priced things	3870	A
we realize that for the individual person some things are very important uh matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it	3870	A
but by the same token some of these charges they make for	3870	A
well- well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line there should be some control of that	3870	A
yes and that's what's giving the local um insurance companies hard times that's the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals and you get something done and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it	3870	A
yes we've had several of them_1 my wife and i both have had that recent	3870	A
yes	3870	A
see that that bothers me about the government see uh my	3870	A
do you think that these- that these insurance things should be covered on a state basis or US government basis	3870	A
well i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately uh the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote	3870	B
has uh provided some very good health care and uh much	3870	B
i think inadequate health care uh and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces and i think	3870	B
um it's inevitable it is just a matter of	3870	B
uh time and mistakes and they're both inevitable	3870	B
well it's gonna make it tough for them and it's it's gonna be a difficult transition i don't know uh how it's gonna uh	3870	B
play out in terms of the particulars but i don't think society- society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long	3870	B
our uh	3870	B
physical mental and spiritual health uh it's really very costly uh and uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this my	3870	B
right	3870	B
um-hum yeah	3870	B
yeah there are abuses of they're abusive of privilege	3870	B
right	3870	B
well this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address because i know this is addressed by uh in Canada i- i have a a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in Canada	3870	B
and they made the transition uh and i think that the uh for example duplication of magnetic resonance imagers uh	3870	B
i've i had one myself and uh	3870	B
they're wonderful technologies but cities have uh three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need	3870	B
so i think that what the marketplace doesn't do because of the way the system has worked and it doesn't allocate resources optimally because	3870	B
there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills	3870	B
what's begun to change all of that the people paying the bills uh employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they've seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years	3870	B
so i think the evolution will be interesting uh Hawaii has a system that is apparently working and uh it'll be interesting to see how how	3870	B
uh much more attention we pay to that i do think though that it's inevitable primarily because of the pain uh that people are feeling uh under the circumstances and i believe that	3870	B
it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers	3870	B
uh i don't know i like that idea i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances	3870	B
with the profit incentive work very very well uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste	3870	B
that's that's that's the problem with government uh uh administration of these programs and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with government is gonna have to change in this regard	3870	B
you know that's really a tough one for me to answer i don't uh uh i would like to see the greatest improvement in management	3870	B
my my field- my field is the cognitive sciences and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done um	3870	B
as a function of the operating systems in place and those operating systems have to change and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems	3870	B
and so a state or federal application uh could work uh it all depends upon the way we structure the environment we may have to do	3870	B
-hello	3818	A
yes do you have any pets	3818	A
oh what kind	3818	A
okay	3818	A
i bet what happened to the rabbit	3818	A

oh you're kidding	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
oh	3818	A
he doesn't have any pets	3818	A
um	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
oh	3818	A
um	3818	A
um-hum um-hum	3818	A
oh for crying out loud well	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
um-hum um-hum well we don't have that problem Lady hardly ever barks at all unless she's outside playing and uh Chasta only barks like when the paper boy delivers the mail she might bark for a little bit	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
hm	3818	A
i'll be	3818	A
oh that's too bad	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
yeah that would that would really be upsetting with me too if my neighbors didn't like my dogs you know	3818	A
and uh well of course two of two other neighbors have dogs you know and they get to come over and play	3818	A
um-hum hum	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
um-hum um-hum well some people have dogs but they really don't like them_1 i don't know why they even keep them_1	3818	A
you know really some- a lot of people have pets and	3818	A
oh yeah God mine are like my family	3818	A
at night they sit out here by the door by the patio door and look in you know sit side by side	3818	A
so every night i think for two hours every night and then we let them_1 in	3818	A
and they come in they just lay down but just i guess just the idea that they're in the house with us for a while you know	3818	A
uh-huh so	3818	A
well	3818	A
well that's a shame you know and you can- i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that that would be awful	3818	A
you know	3818	A
well that's too bad	3818	A
but anyhow we don't have that problem like i say	3818	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3818	A
well at least you can still get some right	3818	A
well that's good well let's see	3818	A
isn't it funny though i just wondered if someday this was going to happen	3818	A
hello	3818	B
i do i have a big dog	3818	B
huh oh he's just a big bloodhound	3818	B
i had some rabbits and they were much easier to take care of than this big dog is	3818	B
well we got the bloodhound and the rabbits and the bloodhound didn't mix well so they were easier to get rid of than the big dog and my kids were anxious to have a have a puppy	3818	B
uh-huh	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
huh	3818	B
okay well i've had some really interesting things happening with my dog let me tell you about this	3818	B
i have a dog that at nighttime when it wants to go in the garage because_1 he's kind of spoiled he will bark	3818	B
and i have a neighbor next door who gets real mad at this so	3818	B
for the last three weeks he's turned us into the police and in to the uh the animal control and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so	3818	B
it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my kids and to come over and kill the dog it's going- it's just berserk	3818	B
he does he has a dog himself out in the backyard that barks but for some reason this dog's bark just drives him up a wall and he's just	3818	B
i don't know it's been really upsetting he keeps calling and	3818	B
you know it bothers me when the dog barks so as soon as he barks we put him in the garage but	3818	B
i don't know what the problem is	3818	B
he is an alcoholic so i think he's just found something to vent his anger on and it's he's decided that it's us but	3818	B
uh-huh	3818	B
see that's like this dog it only barks i mean the longest it ever barks is five or ten minutes	3818	B
but you know he's called over and said he's going to get the police to take Lee away and that we're idiots for having a dog like that and	3818	B
it's just really been upsetting because_1 they were real good neighbors up until this	3818	B
this time	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
well see everybody everybody all the way up has a dog that's what's so strange every house all- you know all the way up from- on five you know five houses up from me and five houses down have dogs	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
yeah i figure why have them_1 if you're not gonna take real good care of them_1	3818	B
but	3818	B
yep that's how this one is	3818	B
huh	3818	B
yeah feel loved huh huh well i haven't i don't know what- i you know i can't figure out how to solve the problem unless i get rid of Kahuna and uh you know	3818	B
i've got to live in this neighborhood so it's almost boiled down to do i	3818	B
do i keep a pet that i love or do i live unhappily in a neighborhood paranoid of whether he's ever gonna bark or not	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
well i'm thinking about going back to rabbits they were quiet mess free	3818	B
so	3818	B
boy	3818	B
well this is really a treat	3818	B
yeah let's hope it happens again-	3818	B
life is yeah well you know there's something that um i really find kind of maybe it's not an invasion of privacy but it's kind of annoying	3853	B
um you know phone calls uh automated	3853	B
you know i mean i- i find that really {offencing} or offensive	3853	B
yeah and they don't stop i mean they you know you call and it	3853	B
it could be any time of the day and and what happens is is they'll call especially- especially those computer ones	3853	B
they'll call and and they don't you can't get them_1 off the line you'll hang up and you pick it up a minute later and they'll still be on there	3853	B
yes i just had you know that just happened a couple day of i guess it's kind of fresh in my mind because_1 this happened a couple of days ago	3853	B
i'd picked up the phone and it's you know they started talking giving me all this spiel and then you know you try to hang up because_1 there's there's nobody to talk to there's only just um	3853	B
and- you hang up and then you pick up to make a phone they're still on there	3853	B
i know i know that is	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
but uh as far as privacy- uh invasion of privacy i there really you know i guess i'm kind of like you i don't really find it	3853	B
there isn't a whole lot that i feel like it's a invasion of privacy- of privacy um	3853	B
oh i know	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
well the	3853	B
i guess you know there's um	3853	B
i- guess- i guess i don't think about that very often because it it has become the norm you know um	3853	B
yeah and you they find everything- i mean they find out everything about you they want to know your you know where you live what you do what you know and some of the questions yeah and some of the	3853	B
uh-huh	3853	B
yes you know sometimes that does happen you know sometimes they they would you know somebody would call on the phone and and uh you know you think it's just	3853	B
uh regular type questions but really they are kind of prying into your to your life you know you	3853	B
they wanna know uh where you live how long you been living there	3853	B
do you own do you rent you know what time of the days they're usually home what uh you know and sometimes you know you just kind of go through the routine of giving it out and then you think about it afterwards	3853	B
yes	3853	B
uh-huh	3853	B
right	3853	B
oh yeah oh yeah	3853	B
yep	3853	B
but um	3853	B
i guess it is i'm i'm in that area so it's uh	3853	B
well i'm yeah i'm in sales so i	3853	B
you always kind of uh you know it- i know that when we when i sell a product to a new customer	3853	B
that's always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that	3853	B
um you know but i know that in order for our company to survive we can't you know uh	3853	B
don't wanna take the risks so	3853	B
um i- i suppose some of those uh	3853	B
you know that's- that's the funniest thing is be rare i mean maybe one out of ten	3853	B
do we check on it yeah you know but it's kind of a routine type thing where you just do it and and you file it away and uh	3853	B
you know at random we'll we'll go ahead and check on it but um it's not	3853	B
no huh-uh	3853	B
so you know i just gather the information and and somebody else uh you know at their leisure time uh will check on those credit references but	3853	B
yeah most of them_1 are yeah most of them_1 are but they're not all you know they're not done all at the same time	3853	B
and um	3853	B
you know i- i wonder about credit uh	3853	B
i have trouble uh coming up with things that actually i've considered invasion of privacy and perhaps it's because i've become so accustomed to the fact that that's the way technology works	3853	A
what's that	3853	A
oh gosh yes yes	3853	A
i suppose that it's an invasion in that they know where you are and and	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
oh seriously i've never had that experience	3853	A
that seems unusual	3853	A
you know that almost seems dangerous because_1 what if you picked up the phone to call nine one one or something and you	3853	A
i wonder if that was a problem in their system that doesn't seem like it should work that way	3853	A
haunting you	3853	A
i used to be concerned that everyone no matter what the creditor always wanted to know your social security number but then i figured well they're	3853	A
they all have to link it back to some number that -that only you have and so	3853	A
they have access to all your records	3853	A
um-hum um-hum	3853	A
if you wanna use credit you have to pay the price and that's	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
that's probably why you have gotten those calls because they know that you're one of those people who um are in a	3853	A
i don't know income bracket or something but who has disposable income that's why they're after you	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
do you own do you rent	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
yeah i generally don't	3853	A
you know when you buy a new product how the um warranty card always asks your level of income	3853	A
and it usually says optional so i i rarely fill it i i don't think i ever fill it out frankly but uh they they wanna know they would like to come back and	3853	A
see whether or not you're gonna buy another product	3853	A
interesting	3853	A
that's how marketing works today i think	3853	A
are you	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
um-hum um-hum	3853	A
really huh	3853	A
oh yeah you don't wanna take risks	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
do you personally look at those credit uh references or is there someone else who does that	3853	A
someone else in your company does that	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
oh really so there isn't someone who every time does it just not you	3853	A
hm	3853	A
but most of them are checked on routinely just by someone else	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
uh-huh that makes sense	3853	A
okay have you had to return anything lately that you've bought	3891	A
yeah	3891	A
oh yeah that'll be nice	3891	A
i haven't either really	3891	A
right right well i think it's gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have to return it most most places are willing to you know go with the customer	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
on uh yeah i know that- i know	3891	A
that's true that's true i haven't had to return anything that i can think of but uh you know with- like radios and things they've become so cheap that even if they do break it's better just to go get another one than have it fixed	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
yeah uh the stuff like that you know	3891	A
yeah and i you know like television and stereos and things they're a lot cheaper if they're Japanese made	3891	A
you know i've i've gotten to the point where i think so but um i've had to return um i think a television one time and um	3891	A
uh the color went out but and it was like a month later and i didn't have any problem whatsoever which i think is good but	3891	A
you know years ago you didn't never have to return anything everything worked for so long	3891	A
oh yeah	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
well that's not bad at all well this is the first time i've ever gotten anybody outside of Texas	3891	A
really	3891	A
wow	3891	A
um clothes is about mainly what i've you know gotten lately and i think they've gone downhill	3891	A
as- as far as unless you it's you get what you pay for	3891	A
right	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
that's true	3891	A
right	3891	A
yeah	3891	A
yeah i agree with you it's kind of hard for the small man	3891	A
to make it you know with the the homemade thing	3891	A
you know	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
right	3891	A
wow that's pretty interesting	3891	A
hum	3891	A
let me think of something else here	3891	A
um i can't that's the only thing i can think of is clothes you know and and they're going up so high if you want a well made you know piece of clothing	3891	A
or in matter of fact furniture also you know you have to go you have to pay a lot more it's the old adage you get- get what you pay for	3891	A
but um you know and you can get oh i know i bought a real cheap couch one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didn't last very long you know	3891	A
i think the frame of it wasn't really good because_1 it was probably mass produced	3891	A
you know	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
hum	3891	A
do you have a problem with your water heater	3891	A
if you-	3891	A
um no not really i uh i may have had to have a	3891	B
a few minor repairs but i haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future i'm gonna be buying a big computer and	3891	B
um one of these eight millimeter camcorders	3891	B
so i've been i've been studying these things but uh i haven't had to return too many things i	3891	B
and	3891	B
i think it really turns down to	3891	B
picking who you want to buy from and i hate to say it but the field- the electronics devices that i buy the the ones in Japan in generally	3891	B
are much higher quality from working	3891	B
i mean i hate to admit it but it's true they and they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public	3891	B
that was made in China	3891	B
works just fine and it cost me four dollars	3891	B
yes it's amazing isn't it	3891	B
yes	3891	B
uh-huh	3891	B
that's right and and and that's been really um way it's been for me for the last five or six years that- i returned a TV set to be repaired but the problem was that uh we had a a lightning storm and	3891	B
the lightning flashed in through the power and uh hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just uh one of those circumstances	3891	B
no	3891	B
well i tell you most of my talks are in Texas that's true i but i've been- i've been uh talked into um California twice in the last uh week or two	3891	B
yeah	3891	B
well we're being filled up with a lot of	3891	B
of stores that have huge quantities of of uh clothes and articles and you know we've got Wal-Marts and Gee- Gee Bees and a whole bunch of things and	3891	B
i don't know how we can support all of those things and the and- and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them_1 on the market cheaper for the public	3891	B
and when that happens more of those products are likely to have uh inferior working ability and that's when you have to start returning them_1	3891	B
so	3891	B
yeah	3891	B
that's right and i- i- i have a friend who does make uh beautiful furniture but he has to charge twice as much when you go to a store	3891	B
if it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it	3891	B
yep	3891	B
huh	3891	B
yes	3891	B
do you	3891	B
hum	3891	B
actually i had some uh i bought a water softener for my home	3891	B
and i didn't have to return it but it didn't work well and i finally- i finally had to have the company come out and to check it out so i did have that problem	3891	B
and it was a matter- i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself	3891	B
of course my dad is a big sailor so he likes to sail and he likes to do all that stuff but it's been a long time since he's had a boat	3868	B
but we use to go to Lake Michigan and fix up you know work he had a boat that he was working on so we used to do that but i've never sailed	3868	B
i was in from Chicago i grew up around there and then um	3868	B
moved down here about ten years ago	3868	B
no it was called- it was uh it was an old forty foot yacht that	3868	B
no i mean it well no and it it was never in the water it was on dry dock so it was uh always kind of just sitting there so	3868	B
um he fishes i don't do you	3868	B
huh so do you- from- from docks or from what	3868	B

oh	3868	A
is that right	3868	A
oh that's	3868	A
well as about as a matter of fact about two years ago right now uh i've completely and totally remodeled and restored my kitchen	3893	B
yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the kitchen we've we had was um	3893	B
had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops	3893	B
at first i was- we were just gonna paint the thing and you know how everything just sort of grows	3893	B
and uh so i ended up just just tearing- tearing out the whole place and uh putting sheet rock in and building my own cabinets with ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything new floor	3893	B
well uh i'm fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own	3893	B
yeah um-hum	3893	B
i love that it's it's really pretty we had just uh Formica	3893	B
and when i built the new cabinets uh i looked into this tile deal and i thought well you know i think we can probably do this	3893	B
and um it was uh	3893	B
it was not even- not hard at all um it just i just followed the instructions the basic instructions that you use with the tile and uh they're not hard at all really it's just about anybody can do that	3893	B
no not at all um uh what we what i've been doing is just using some like bleach and it uh gets it clean but it does it has browned over the the couple of years	3893	B
you know but it really don't look that bad even though it has gotten brown you know what i should have done now that i think about it was used brown colored grout	3893	B
and	3893	B
that's right that's right	3893	B
you know because it does stain some i mean you could whiten it but i never have	3893	B
um about three months probably three or four months	3893	B
yeah yeah	3893	B
well it was for a while the worst part about it was we had to do it when i got to the sink part over here what i did was i left this cabinet	3893	B
just about this one wall where the sink is to the very last	3893	B
and um i figured well you know i'll remodel the rest of the kitchen and then when we get to that point i'll do that last because_1 we so we can keep the sink as long as possible	3893	B
and then we had we were without a sink about a week or a week and a half or so	3893	B
and um what we had to do was just take the dishes and uh put them_1 in a big dish pan	3893	B
and you get water from the bath tub and then rinse them_1 in you know for with the bath water- not not in the tub but you're just letting it run under there you know	3893	B
real really yeah we did eat out a lot	3893	B
not a thing not a thing i almost thought i had cut through a water pipe in the wall but i didn't i just nicked it a little bit it wasn't all the way through and now that was about it	3893	B
yeah well have you have you done anything like that or or anything smaller or	3893	B
um-hum	3893	B
oh no no there's nothing like that here either	3893	B
uh-huh	3893	B
oh yeah	3893	B
yeah	3893	B
sure	3893	B
right right	3893	B
oh sure yeah it does	3893	B
that's right you are	3893	B
and you're and you're half and half	3893	B
yeah	3893	B
oh	3893	B
oh i understand yeah a little latch like yeah right	3893	B
well yeah yeah everything is still so brand new yeah	3893	B
um-hum	3893	B
oh i see	3893	B
well yeah sure	3893	B
no yeah now something like that i would probably have hire- have to hire	3893	B
-okay so have you had a project recently	3893	A
that's a project	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
yes	3893	A
you must you must be pretty handy	3893	A
so you did the tile counter tops how do you like that	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
did you have or do you have any problem with staining of the grout	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
and just start out with that and uh-huh	3893	A
well how long did it take you to complete this	3893	A
that's not bad considering you did it yourself although i'm sure it was a real pain to have to live you know with everything	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
no i know what you mean sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your wife didn't cook for about three months	3893	A
did you have any major catastrophes or anything	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
well that's quite an undertaking uh you know	3893	A
well nothing that big a deal my husband did um he made a cedar closet and shelving out in the garage uh for us which really was nice um	3893	A
i don't know how it is in Biloxi we Dallas has no basements i suspect Biloxi	3893	A
yeah well we come from the Midwest where there's basements and you know so you have to make storage where you can	3893	A
and uh he bought the sheeting uh the cedar sheeting and put that in and i didn't know for certain how that would you know how that would work out if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out but	3893	A
it's been great we haven't had any problems with moths or anything and the extra he finished the outside painted it to match the uh garage walls which is white and it's just beautiful it really added a whole lot you know {storagewise} to the house	3893	A
but uh i think the only glitches he ran into on that i put a few nails in it so i consider myself a partner in this but	3893	A
yeah right the only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the doors he had to put in oh like some extra closure because even though he thought that the um the plywood that he got was straight	3893	A
somehow the humidity or something warped it a little bit while he was building it and we have to have a little closing you know to hold it down at the bottom	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
but that- that was about it but our house in only four years old so we haven't done you know just a whole lot to it at this point	3893	A
um-hum although we're talking about adding uh the the ceilings here are high and the pitch of the uh roofs are very high and we're talking about adding like some rooms up in the attic space	3893	A
uh because there is so much space up there	3893	A
but uh i don't know that that's something we will undertake ourselves part of it we'll probably do you know like hanging the	3893	A
well actually uh oh the last eight or ten years i have	3856	B
an aunt and i i should say have like done our family reunion	3856	B
and uh oh you know we send out letters to everybody and we rent a place in this uh savings and loan in a in a little town	3856	B
and uh then everybody brings a covered dish and that sort of thing and uh	3856	B
it's real nice because my mother uh	3856	B
had seven brothers and sisters and if we didn't do this like the cousins would never see each other the aunts and uncles um that's the type family reunion we've had there you know	3856	B
so uh	3856	B
you know if we found you know the years we don't do that nobody- nobody sees each other because everybody lives in different places you know	3856	B
oh	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
oh	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
uh-huh yeah everybody fixes their specialty or whatever	3856	B
yeah well it really in your case and mine too uh i guess in most everybody's as far as especially more distant relatives you know uh cousins aunts and uncles and so on	3856	B
you just wouldn't see them if you didn't do something like that	3856	B
well my immediate family like on my side uh has gotten large because there's four of us and now we've all had children and now we all have grandchildren	3856	B
so that makes just my immediate family like thirty people so we do a separate reunion and we have a lake house uh about seventy miles from here	3856	B
so we we've done it once we all get together down there	3856	B
and um that works out real well because there's a lot	3856	B
well lot of things everybody can do they can fish or they can you know swim or things like that	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
well it really doesn't much matter where or how you do it as long as you manage to do it every how often did like your families up there have them	3856	B
yeah	3856	B
yeah we have taken like old home movies from you know twenty five thirty years ago and and shown them at the family reunion	3856	B
uh-huh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago uh there's places now that do that	3856	B
and uh it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get about thirty or forty old reels you know	3856	B
on there and it and then you can skip around and find what you want and all that it really has uh worked out good	3856	B
so uh	3856	B
so how did you get on the TI thing	3856	B
what experience have you had with family reunions	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
huh that's really good	3856	A
yeah my mom my mom's family is all	3856	A
my family is really scattered out so if we didn't have family reunions we simply would never see each other for example um	3856	A
my	3856	A
my parents live in Seattle Washington	3856	A
however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from Utah	3856	A
and all of my dad's uh relatives and family are from Oregon so we we usually have family reunions once a year and we'll go to Utah and uh	3856	A
go to Oregon um	3856	A
my mom puts a big deal into the family reunion when they go to Utah um and um	3856	A
she sometimes plans them and and sometimes helps in planning them usually um Southern Utah is so hot that um we pick there's the	3856	A
they rent out this cabin that's up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get some- the cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time	3856	A
and that's what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also	3856	A
uh	3856	A
yeah	3856	A
yeah i know at the the family reunions on my dad's side that we go to in Oregon um we usually um	3856	A
have it at a park and so you know swimming is always part of one of the activities so	3856	A
oh there's a there's a family reunion- reunion um once a year um	3856	A
for for each for my father's side and for my mother's side i know and my wife also um	3856	A
so they try when they have family reunions they don't have them as regularly but when they do they try and make big deal out of it and usually have you know something like a talent show or	3856	A
um each family um does something	3856	A
um	3856	A
yeah	3856	A
yeah my mom- my grandma also has some	3856	A
we haven't particularly shown those at the reunions but my grandma has some home movies and we ever whenever we go to her house we like to	3856	A
see those those are	3856	A
you know nice for memories	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
current events you take a newspaper	3826	A
is that right is that how you usually keep up on the news	3826	A
uh-huh	3826	A
yeah	3826	A
yeah i don't either it's mostly by the news but mine is mostly- mostly- mostly just like the six o'clock news or eleven o'clock is usually about the time i'm ready to look at TV	3826	A
uh yeah some	3826	A
oh	3826	A
huh	3826	A
yeah that's had a lot of publicity hasn't it	3826	A
uh-huh	3826	A
right	3826	A
i haven't seen it	3826	A
but it sure will be interesting to see how see it once i do figure out what all the controversy's about	3826	A
yeah i don't think we got the full story but i don't you know i haven't seen the movie so i don't really have an opinion about what he had to say yet	3826	A
right	3826	A
but who was involved that's i guess that's the story to tell huh	3826	A
yeah just like this years later maybe	3826	A
that's probably exactly right	3826	A
right	3826	A
that's right	3826	A
that's right so what brought you to San Francisco have you-	3826	A
did-	3826	A
did are you living right in San Francisco then	3826	A
oh well you're right in the middle of things then aren't you	3826	A
a job	3826	A
my brother lived out here and he and my dad owned a little trucking company and they asked my husband to come and run it	3826	A
but we lived in Concord for several years before that	3826	A
and he grew up over there in San Mateo so we know that	3826	A
right	3826	A
so we	3826	A
um about nine years now	3826	A
i do i really like it	3826	A
yeah i really like it	3826	A
boy that's for sure you can't even uh i mean it's not even fathomable that	3826	A
so the question is how do we keep up with current events	3826	B
as a matter of fact as you called i was uh taking a look at uh the San Francisco Examiner	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
uh i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour fairly regularly and uh the network news less often	3826	B
and will watch some of the talking heads programs on PBS	3826	B
uh and that's pretty much about it we don't get Time or Newsweek um	3826	B
and uh as a matter of fact i don't get any of those sort of of magazines anymore	3826	B
yeah do you watch the network news	3826	B
yeah out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock uh well they're moving the prime time schedule up from	3826	B
uh eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten	3826	B
and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here	3826	B
um will move up on all three of the local network affiliates	3826	B
i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie JFK have you have you seen-	3826	B
yeah it's really interesting to listen to how different people uh approach different topics um	3826	B
it the i didn't realize this but uh Dan Rather at CBS was the first person to view this Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination	3826	B
and he had viewed it the day after and uh got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one	3826	B
and uh it's really interesting- and he Rather wrote- later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece of uh uh evidence backwards that he'd argued like a lot of other people that Kennedy had lurched forward	3826	B
after the shot and he'd in fact been uh forced backward which lends credence to the two	3826	B
uh to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie	3826	B
i haven't either	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
it is uh you know i uh are you one of those people who believes that it was uh not a lone gunman that that we just never really got the full story	3826	B
yeah i- i haven't seen the movie either but i- i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy	3826	B
and uh	3826	B
well that's what Oliver Stone's seeking to do and i- i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes	3826	B
uh really important news comes to people through movies	3826	B
through television	3826	B
yeah and and i think that's really interesting i know that um uh my wife and i were talking about	3826	B
how uh much uh attitudes toward women uh and and the relationships between men and women husband's and wives uh are changing and i think people get more of that information	3826	B
through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper	3826	B
uh that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and and uh i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um	3826	B
it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services	3826	B
so much uh so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news	3826	B
um i came up here i was uh working for uh a unit of AT&T and was promoted i came out to California to go to graduate school and and was hired out of the PhD program um in southern California	3826	B
and went to work for a unit of AT&T and they promoted me and moved me up here and we liked it my my wife is from San Diego	3826	B
live uh right out by the park right uh right off uh Lindley Meadow in Golden Gate Park	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
yeah what took you to Texas	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
oh yeah	3826	B
uh-huh and you grew up in Walnut Creek yeah how long have you been in Texas	3826	B
that's do you like it	3826	B
that's a i- i hear a lot of good things about Texas	3826	B
it's big it's probably more affordable housing it's	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
i well i the the we live yeah living here it's just it's	3826	B
well why don't you tell me about your lawn and gardening	3832	A
do you do you have a large lawn	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
well i like the yard to look nice but i can't say i really enjoy it	3832	A
yeah no i've i've got other things that i like to do and that's that's not my favorite	3832	A
i don't know sweating- out there sweating in the sun you know and pulling weeds and those stuff	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
yeah and i won't mow the lawn either and you know watering the lawn is a pain in the butt because we don't have a an electric system so	3832	A
or sprinkler system i should say so	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
well what do you like to do when you garden	3832	A
oh so you actually grow vegetables	3832	A
well that's nice	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
yeah you know i i find that gardening for me is just uh it it's expensive	3832	A
you know you get into buying as many plants that you need to make it look good and you know you can't just buy two or three you've got to buy a dozen for one small area	3832	A
you know so	3832	A
exactly and i know we've got this spring we've got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because they're	3832	A
they kicked the bucket so	3832	A
well that means we'll just have to put something else	3832	A
and so but you know we haven't we hadn't had any freeze damage this year of course because it hasn't been that cold i guess it's been about the same with you all	3832	A
yeah and i	3832	A
and the rain is unbelievable i mean it's just	3832	A
we got a few a few flakes last week	3832	A
just enough to make it look you know i mean it didn't even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down	3832	A
yeah what about you	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
that's true that's true ours are well they're they're kind of dormant they're pretty mellow right now	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
in fact i just had a garden company come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your lawn give me an estimate because i just don't want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because because i don't know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed	3832	A
so i just let them treat all my weeds and i won't have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the garage	3832	A
well yeah it's better for us because we don't we have a pretty small lawn	3832	A
so and and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than thirty bucks so	3832	A
i don't think they do the ants i think they're just dealing with the weeds	3832	A
no because we've got a real problem they're overtaking everything	3832	A
so but i mean we got some good grass but it's getting you know um	3832	A
exactly it's getting choked out	3832	A
you you still have onions growing	3832	A
oh	3832	A
so so do you go uh give them away that you have so many	3832	A
you use them pretty much yourself	3832	A
well that's good	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
so the green onions the green onions grow into the	3832	A
the bigger onions	3832	A
wow	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
well you sound like somebody that needs to come to my house and do a little work but	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
and that stuff fades away though right	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
uh-huh so it doesn't cover- i mean it it it doesn't compete with the regular grass or anything	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
oh let's see it hurts um i don't know i do quite a bit of it	3832	B
um pretty fairly fairly fair amount yeah yeah we switch plants here and there do you like to garden	3832	B
oh really	3832	B
oh no no i don't like that no	3832	B
no not that part just the pretty part	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
right right	3832	B
yeah i like to get out in the morning	3832	B
and that's it	3832	B
oh mostly i like to keep a little garden	3832	B
right right right just like um salad salad vegetables that kind of thing	3832	B
and um	3832	B
that's about it	3832	B
just you know and shrubbery and everything and to keep the weeds down and stuff put mulch around it so you don't have to weed them	3832	B
it really is	3832	B
right	3832	B
right right	3832	B
so it doesn't look it looks skimpy if you don't	3832	B
oh heaven	3832	B
really	3832	B
right	3832	B
right i think it's only frozen- um we've had a freeze twice	3832	B
and it wasn't very bad	3832	B
right right did you get any snow	3832	B
oh you're kidding really	3832	B
right	3832	B
well that's nice	3832	B
no none none not none whatsoever so some of the plants are still kind of growing along	3832	B
so that makes it nice	3832	B
yeah but soon it'll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in the spring and then it kind of dies down	3832	B
a little while later when you have to take care of everything	3832	B
right	3832	B
right	3832	B
right	3832	B
wow that's not bad	3832	B
right	3832	B
do they get get rid of the ants and stuff like that	3832	B
oh oh	3832	B
not bad not bad at all though	3832	B
to the point where the weeds are taking over the grass	3832	B
oh my	3832	B
oh let's see i still have onions growing in the garden	3832	B
well they'll in Texas they'll go all year around	3832	B
and then if you want green onions you just go out there and grab some	3832	B
no	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
yeah if you put them in all times of the year you can go out and take them you know for a green onion here and there and then if you have some left over they'll go to a a regular bulb onion and then you can have that the next um	3832	B
the next time next next year yeah	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
huh yeah they will if you let them alone and then you can put them anywhere sometimes i'll put mix them in with plants	3832	B
just have a bunch of green here and there	3832	B
and then oh let's see and then um i put rye grass or my husband did put rye grass out this winter to make it look green	3832	B
um right you put it around September November to make it look green	3832	B
right when it starts getting hot um	3832	B
it'll start dying down and your regular grass will come back in	3832	B
in the	3832	B
no no no no huh-uh it has real shallow roots everything but you got to get out and mow it it looks nice for a while and then it goes away and it kind of fertilizes the grass that's there all the time	3832	B
um i have one child a little girl who's eighteen months old	3806	B
oh wow congratulations	3806	B
um	3806	B
actually even though our daughter is a year and a half we just got her last July we adopted a little girl from Beijing	3806	B
uh yeah my wife is also Chinese	3806	B
my my wife is Chinese	3806	B
and so we um traveled to Beijing and we adopted her and so we're	3806	B
she's just at a playful age right now we just do a lot of things play with her and take her to a park of course can't- right now it's too cold to go out too much here it's been really cold	3806	B
but um	3806	B
yeah uh although we were gone for most of our Christmas and we had a nice time in in California for our vacation visiting family	3806	B
so	3806	B
um yeah	3806	B
no that's where my wife's from and we also visited Seattle where i'm from	3806	B
and	3806	B
so	3806	B
we just love- mainly we we like to spend time playing games and	3806	B
um	3806	B
just she's sort of at a playful age teaching her new words things like that	3806	B
yeah so yeah your your activities probably consist of staying up at night um	3806	B
really	3806	B
-that's good	3806	B
oh that's nice	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
well we found that was important too for sleeping through the night um having um their their own room	3806	B
in fact it was almost trained out of our daughter during vacation where at our parents' house where it's just um one room for all of us our daughter and us um	3806	B
the first few nights back she was terrified to be in the room by herself but now she's	3806	B
sleeping through the night again so	3806	B
um we	3806	B
my wife um	3806	B
is we also- other things we're trying- trying to do um um	3806	B
is potty train our our girl a year and a half that's a little some people think that's a little bit early but um	3806	B
she was the foster parents our friends in China who had taken care of her before we could get her um	3806	B
have a Chinese generally potty train their children a little bit earlier earlier and um	3806	B
so um we're having spend some time with that also	3806	B
but	3806	B
and	3806	B
yeah well i'd	3806	B
she doesn't enjoy it that much but um she's learning slowly but surely	3806	B
we have a little book it talks about giving rewards and so it's a pleasant experience and things like that	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
yeah but there's a lot of we we're just having lots of fun with with our little girl right now um she has lots of toys got little	3806	B
she especially likes the little telephone and the little tyke bike that she has	3806	B
um and then reading she likes us to to go through the books you know and she could say a few word you know she could learning to say the names of you know a lot of simple animals and um	3806	B
and the you know the sounds that they make	3806	B
like duck says quack	3806	B
and doggy says ruff things like that	3806	B
so that's about her	3806	B
her stage right now and she's running around she she started	3806	B
when we first adopted her we she she wasn't walking yet but she was soon walking within a couple weeks after that and now she's running all	3806	B
how many children do you have	3806	A
um okay	3806	A
we've got one he's uh thirteen weeks yesterday	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
oh okay	3806	A
from Beijing	3806	A
oh okay	3806	A
pardon	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
it's not not real toasty here either but i imagine it's a good deal colder in Iowa	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
is that where you're from originally	3806	A
okay	3806	A
uh yeah	3806	A
right now uh our son's just uh dealing with grunts and squeaks and grinning and crying and	3806	A
actually no he sleeps real well at night	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
he'll he he generally sleeps through the night uh he'll go down about till- well he don't doesn't go down till about ten ten thirty which is a little tough when you got a lot of studying to do but uh	3806	A
he'll uh he won't get up till like six o'clock uh somewhere between six and eight in the morning	3806	A
he'll be ravenously hungry by then	3806	A
but he's truly a jolly little fellow and sleeps through the night too which is a real blessing	3806	A
uh it- it took about the first four weeks before he started that	3806	A
which i don't think it was quite coincidental but he started sleeping through the night about the time we took him out of our bed and put him in a crib in in the next room	3806	A
suddenly he started sleeping through the night almost consistently	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah that's good	3806	A
that's good	3806	A
pardon	3806	A
um-hum	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
that's got to be a a lot of fun	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah uh uh it's you know	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah well they they the children are gonna to eventually training- wind up training themselves but	3806	A
um they can be trained into it pretty early too	3806	A
so i remember some of the strange potty training experiences when i we were growing up amongst brothers and sisters	3806	A
so	3806	A
and we're almost kind of not looking forward to that	3806	A
anyway	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
um	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah that's good	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
well this is an unusual topic what do you think about it	3825	B
well that sounds great Ellen how far away do they come from right	3825	B
oh okay	3825	B
oh okay that makes sense nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once	3825	B
um-hum	3825	B
yeah	3825	B
that's interesting you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this then	3825	B
southern California's still pretty large	3825	B
i see	3825	B
and	3825	B
yeah	3825	B
well my experience um	3825	B
has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family uh	3825	B
years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side and uh	3825	B
they haven't had a reunion since then they just show up at funerals and weddings	3825	B
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that but anyway my mother's side	3825	B
we had our our first real reunion that i've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some- some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and	3825	B
uh they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and	3825	B
people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and you know a lot of that sort of thing since it was the first one that we'd had	3825	B
the you- you could do that once now next time we have one we'll have to think of something more creative to do	3825	B
oh	3825	B
well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy	3825	B
not a passion huh	3825	B
um	3825	B
i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy and i- i suspect we will do more of it	3825	B
um i found out some about some of the relatives i didn't you know i- i didn't even know their names some of the	3825	B
two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and	3825	B
uh there's a lot of things there you have to stop they're really kind of fascinating i found out my grandmother was one of a twin and we don't even know where the twin	3825	B
we have virtually no	3825	B
no background on on her on the twin	3825	B
uh my grandmother's uh	3825	B
sister	3825	B
who would be somewhere in in West Virginia i'm sure she's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago	3825	B
i'm i'm quite a bit i'm probably a lot older than you are	3825	B
um	3825	B
i don't know	3825	B
yeah i at first i it took eight times to find you- you so i told my husband um you know what should i say and then he reminded me but um	3825	A
um his- in his family uh what they usually do on his dad's side his mom or um the aunts will send out little postcards	3825	A
like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the	3825	A
where to meet and you know just to bring anything and so they just notify everyone by mail and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short um	3825	A
or a small um dinner type thing	3825	A
um they come from	3825	A
well they all meet in Portland and they come as far as oh Seattle and and sometimes we've gone and we were from- we were living in Utah at the time	3825	A
and um but his his dad's family is all around the area and	3825	A
his mom's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern Utah and people would come from Seattle to there and um	3825	A
let's see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and they would	3825	A
um assign a different person each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody	3825	A
yeah yeah and the people who are down there like they'll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area and that person can call	3825	A
you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too	3825	A
and then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone's sort of involved	3825	A
oh well that's my husband's side and my mom's my mom's or my family- family uh we- we all live in southern California so we just have to either call or	3825	A
give a formal invite and we're all there so	3825	A
yeah well i mean LA Orange County area i mean everyone's you know mostly not farther than an hour away	3825	A
uh-huh	3825	A
oh	3825	A
wow	3825	A
well you know that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband's	3825	A
mother's side together is um they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and everyone- inevitably everyone is just	3825	A
very interested and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that and so everyone has to update their little	3825	A
books or whatever	3825	A
um uh i do but not to very much compared to my mother-in-law	3825	A
oh	3825	A
oh	3825	A
really is that your your grandma's own sibling and she	3825	A
oh i see oh so	3825	A
well maybe um they just moved away and then just sort of lost contact and	3825	A
what do you think have been the most significant changes	3819	A
so lawyers	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
well i think that's a big contributor i think women have uh really	3819	A
um begun to penetrate a lot of fields that were dominated by men for centuries	3819	A
oh yeah	3819	A
uh-huh well i think um	3819	A
one of the best things that has happened in the twentieth century has been the uh penetration of a lot of these fields by women and i think	3819	A
it's gonna continue uh and even though it's pretty difficult now for	3819	A
some men and and a lot of women i think uh	3819	A
it's gonna bring very good things and uh we're going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but it's a painful transition	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
well i think there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and i guess that's the big thing	3819	A
you know as people change their attitudes that's gonna make the biggest difference women uh participating as equal partners	3819	A
in our society is one of the best things that will ever happen and history will record that but a lot of people really don't like that idea and uh	3819	A
no i i'm not look at what happened with the Anita Hill testimony before the Senate subcommittee and	3819	A
uh now i'm not surprised by that at all we have uh we have a two year old my wife uh works out of the home um and uh	3819	A
uh i think just looking at how uh her uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before	3819	A
so it's it it's really changing attitudes and um the economic necessity and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big difference i think	3819	A
um it's a painful transition but a really important one and	3819	A
yeah i think it's a big step for humankind and i think uh it's it's real progress but there are a lot of people with attitudes that have to change and i- i guess in answering the question that's what i would say i'd say	3819	A
that overall it's just the attitude of men and women toward equal participation and equal pay and equal political influence and all sorts of other things for women because	3819	A
that's really gonna be better for everybody but a lot of people are threatened by that as is reflected in what goes on	3819	A
yeah i	3819	A
well i think i think both	3819	A
yeah both attitudes have to change and i think uh	3819	A
um it's it's evident- evident to me as i look at all the television shows that now focus on the relationship between men and women uh watching Roseanne last night watching	3819	A
uh the show that preceded it Home Improvements all these television shows which reach the American people are beginning to reflect new attitudes and those	3819	A
well and not only i mean the the fact of the matter is that women have have carried more than their weight and are still doing that and	3819	A
um i see i think this is part of the problem for men as well as a guy i recognize that it's uh it's men who've suffered from this too because men need to learn- to learn	3819	A
uh mainly the fact that they let women in law now	3819	B
i think that had a lot to do with the way people thought about women	3819	B
not just lawyers but police officers and judges and	3819	B
the whole legal profession in general	3819	B
because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male	3819	B
and now there's women in it and i think that affected a lot of things	3819	B
oh i can i can definitely agree with that i'm i'm in a field that most people say is strictly male	3819	B
yeah mechanics	3819	B
oh yeah very painful especially when you have certain women that take very dim views on mothers that actually work	3819	B
i'm a mother of two and i still hold down a job and a lot of people say well you're not home with your kids all the time your kids are gonna turn out bad i don't think so	3819	B
some men but you'd believe you wouldn't believe how many women are against it	3819	B
yeah	3819	B
um-hum	3819	B
oh yeah and i think it's one of the biggest steps	3819	B
we or any other country in general could take	3819	B
yeah	3819	B
yep	3819	B
yeah that's for sure and you know a lot of people think that the men are the ones that are fighting this	3819	B
but you'd be surprised the majority of the people that are against women going into the work force doing you know even jobs you know on an even keel with men	3819	B
a good percentage of them_1 are the women that are fighting it and most people say well men try and keep women locked up that's not necessarily true	3819	B
i mean the women have these ideas that they got to be the little home makers and they have to stay at home or they're not doing good you know a good job	3819	B
and that's not necessarily so but everybody's blaming it on the guys saying well the guys don't let the women out	3819	B
that's not necessarily so it's just the women have to realize they can do both	3819	B
yep and the fact that women are actually getting out and working and also keeping the home together	3819	B
well it usually just means sort of getting away from the normal	3867	B
uh time spent at uh day to day job in the office and trying to enjoy the outdoors for the most part	3867	B
um i haven't done as much as i use to but i- i still like to go once and a while and go camping	3867	B
right	3867	B
the long ones	3867	B
right	3867	B
my son- my son has recently joined boy scouts and i i've become fairly active with them and and uh	3867	B
he joined about four months ago and we've gone on about three uh camp outs since then uh	3867	B
two of which involved uh back packing and and hiking they're a pretty active troop and i've i've enjoyed it it's gotten me a chance to get back out and do a little bit more again	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
yes uh	3867	B
we uh my family uh and i we lived in Colorado up until about three years ago for about fourteen years and and of course that was a great	3867	B
uh state for camping uh to get up in the mountains and it was easy to go some place on a weekend it's it's a little more difficult for me now living in Texas just because there is so much	3867	B
private land in Texas and there is not too much in the way of national forests and state lands that you can go hiking on here as opposed to states in the west i don't know how the Iowa area is for for that	3867	B
you can really- yeah really get out and hike uh-huh	3867	B
oh yeah uh-huh	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
yeah well camping- camping i guess uh different people look at it in different in different ways and and do different activities whether it's canoeing or	3867	B
camping can still be enjoyable	3867	B
yes the two burner stove	3867	B
right	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
we we've evolved to the stage of uh uh pop up tent camper camping now now that my our kids have gotten a little bit uh uh	3867	B
involved with camping and my wife finally got tired of camping in tents and having to bail out the water during rain storms and so forth so she talked me into getting a pop up camper and so	3867	B
our camping is sometimes a little more leisurely now than it use to be a little more	3867	B
yes uh-huh	3867	B
yeah it's it's somewhere in between camping and going to uh a motel i guess	3867	B
yeah uh-huh	3867	B
my- my son's boy scout troop does an annual uh one week float on the Buffalo River in Arkansas and i am trying to make sure he gets his qualifications in by next spring because_1 i would like to go on the trip with them_1 because_1 they	3867	B
camp out for seven or eight days while on the Buffalo River and they're floating floating for that many days and i am looking forward that would be uh roughing it more than i have in a long time	3867	B
um	3867	A
Tom what does camping mean to you	3867	A
uh-huh	3867	A
um-hum well when i think about camping is uh	3867	A
well back from my boy scout days uh usually means hiking out in the mountains and and uh building your own camp fire bringing your own food in a pack um and	3867	A
and things like that um things that i associate with camping usually	3867	A
the hikes and camping that we do we	3867	A
go to a lake and it might even involve some canoeing and	3867	A
and then we might	3867	A
i remember especially the fifty mile hikes where we'd we'd hike from lake to lake you know one day we'd be at one lake and hike to another lake they might be about five or ten miles away the next day and	3867	A
and things like that	3867	A
uh-huh	3867	A
well i haven't done	3867	A
much recently that's just what comes to mind when i think of camping that is what i think of and was what i did when i was a boy scout um	3867	A
well i just picture myself and i was going to say i really don't know what's available here i know there's some lakes we could drive to but i don't know of any places where	3867	A
you know you can do hiking and stuff like that	3867	A
i grew up um in the Seattle area and the Cascade Mountains were just an hours drive away and that	3867	A
that's where we did a lot of our hiking and camping um and then i lived	3867	A
while i was going to school at the University i was in Utah and there is also you know mountains there where you can	3867	A
do hiking and- plenty of hiking and camping	3867	A
yeah	3867	A
yeah i know for my from my mom um camping is um	3867	A
definitely bringing the Coleman stove and	3867	A
uh-huh even if we do build a campfire along side um the cooking is done on the Coleman stove just because_1 more convenient	3867	A
although even when my family and i went camping when we were growing up uh we went in the tents always you know	3867	A
oh in the camper oh that would that is if what makes it a little more luxurious	3867	A
well i guess the main point is to get to um enjoy the outdoors and	3867	A
you know especially if you go near a lake or mountains or you know beautiful scenery you know	3867	A
that	3867	A
well i was pretty encouraged by what happened this year and and i think with all those draft choices that i hear that they have uh they ought to be able to pick up a few more players that would help them	3877	B
so i'd i'd have to say i think that the J J Boys have done well	3877	B
oh i- i don't think there is any question that Aikman has to be the the starter because he's got the physical tools i mean that other Beuerlein stepped in and did a wonderful job	3877	B
but i don't think that you can until Troy loses the job on his own merits i think the job has to be his now that he's healthy again now if he doesn't perform then i guess the other guy is waiting to step in the wings	3877	B
but he's- but that guy's got his head screwed on right he's not causing a controversy	3877	B
yeah	3877	B
he said he'd hit the first reporter that says the word quarterback controversy	3877	B
yeah and uh but he doesn't- he doesn't like it he doesn't want that he just wants to go out and do his job when he gets a chance to play he kind of i think wants to let his actions	3877	B
speak for themselves pretty well	3877	B
yeah i'm a Dallas native so i've kind of grown up watching and i even i even went to SMU so i didn't even go away for college so i- i in uh north Dallas in Lake Highlands area	3877	B
Richardson School District	3877	B
yeah i was in the Dallas Cowboy Quarterback Club when they started it back in nineteen sixty i was uh just a little kid then and i use to go to the games and sit in the end zone for a buck of something for this little club thing they had	3877	B
i played in up through about seventh grade	3877	B
and i was not big enough to keep getting killed out there uh	3877	B
now you've got to be a Joe Montana fan a little now huh	3877	B
yeah well he's had a tough year but i think he'll probably come back yeah i	3877	B
you know if his doctor's give him the green light i- i think he will more than likely play again but	3877	B
yeah to a certain extent you know they sure have got uh they get the best back up in the league but Steve Young but i don't i don't think that you can throw all of San Francisco's	3877	B
lack of getting through this year to to the quarterback i think it's been i think it's been a variety of things they have had several key injuries in certain spots and couple close ball games could have gone one way or another and	3877	B
and uh you know they are still one of the premier uh four or five teams in the league and they're always one to beat	3877	B
so i don't think there is gonna to be any question they are going to be up there again	3877	B
another thing is some of their guys are getting a little older because_1 they have been up there for a while	3877	B
not since the season is over	3877	B
what i've been watching lately is the uh	3877	B
potential draft coming up as the players declaring which every time another good player throws his name in that means the draft is gonna be that much stronger and i have been watching the uh	3877	B
commitments of the high school players to the colleges lately cause that is going on national signing day is coming up next week	3877	B
when they can sign their letter of intent as to what college they want to go to so i've been watching to see if SMU was gonna get a few good players because_1 they've been kind of struggling along since their death penalty thing	3877	B
yeah i have season tickets so i go to all of the games	3877	B
well i was in the band there i uh was part of the spirit of the campus for a long time and uh it just we have a section of band alumni that all sits together called the Diamond M club we just we get the same season tickets every year and so we're uh	3877	B
we're all there and it's it's just kind of fun but i've got a son seventeen years old and he's gonna be going off to Rice in the fall	3877	B
and he wants to play in the the Mob the marching L band down there so i imagine i will be making a few trips to Houston or following them a couple of places to see him play	3877	B
just one	3877	B
how about you have you got any	3877	B
oh wow	3877	B
yeah what	3877	B
what part of town do you live in	3877	B
oh okay so they go to they go to Plano-	3877	B
well so what do you think they are going to do next year	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
that's right	3877	A
well which quarterback did you like better	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
i like	3877	A
that's right i like	3877	A
that's right that's his dream huh	3877	A
yeah i like the way	3877	A
see that's what i was just saying i like the way he handles the press also he's just under control on the field and off	3877	A
well that's been said plenty of times so	3877	A
speak for themselves	3877	A
yeah so are uh have you been from here all along or did you move from some	3877	A
oh well you're a unique one	3877	A
where did you grow up	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
huh	3877	A
so you've always been a Dallas fan	3877	A
is that right	3877	A
huh did you play yourself	3877	A
uh-huh	3877	A
yeah yeah see i came from the San Francisco area so i- i really liked the Oakland Raiders when they were there but then we kind of had to switch loyalties to San Francisco-	3877	A
yeah well as much of Montana as you can see anymore i guess	3877	A
do you think so there's lots of speculation whether he will or not	3877	A
yeah well well they sure went down hill without him	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
Montana	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yep	3877	A
yeah well	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
well there's not much to talk about as far as where we think the teams are heading this year but kind of a silly topic but	3877	A
oh	3877	A
is it	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
so do you follow do you follow SMU football	3877	A
yep i would say you follow them pretty closely then	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
huh how fun	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
oh	3877	A
yeah how many kids do you have	3877	A
oh that's gonna be uh a lonely house for you next year	3877	A
i have four but they're little i mean my oldest one is just thirteen so	3877	A
i got a ways to go before they leave me	3877	A
i live in Plano	3877	A
yeah uh well you know it's really ironic because it's just about a year ago today we were involved you know actively in that war that was going on at this time and uh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
yeah yeah uh-huh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
um	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
yeah well it it it certainly is not a an easy situation to deal with but uh i uh i i remember last year when the war was going on that i actually was uh if one can be	3831	A
in any way relieved when a war is going on but at least Israel listened to the uh admonitions of the United States about not retaliating uh when those missiles were dropped on them	3831	A
and amazingly we we had those weapons that would counteract those missiles so that they would do a minimal of damage uh the whole thing was very amazing to me i don't think any any of it is right i mean we should be doing any of that stuff	3831	A
oh it's such an misuse of what we are as people but under the circumstances i could not help thinking that probably uh you know five or ten years ago i don't i don't even think that same kind of uh	3831	A
respect uh sufficiently for the United States would have been there that Israel wouldn't have just gone ahead you know uh like that uh	3831	A
Arafat and the and the the P L O and everything would just you know be so rambunctious as to just	3831	A
to retaliate and even- even cause worse damage oh it was a very terrible thing but uh it's uh hm hm	3831	A
uh-huh they did	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
yeah well i guess you know so long as our uh missile systems were holding out to counteract what was being thrown in and things seemed to be working i guess it's	3831	A
it's really worth trying for peace or at least coexistence like you said uh and they have actually gone to peace talks uh since the time of that war to try to	3831	A
hit some kind of a a common ground for coexistence uh	3831	A
yeah uh-huh	3831	A
oh sure	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
um	3831	A
yeah well it amazes me that the guy is still there yeah yeah is not around	3831	A
very strange uh-huh	3831	A
you know	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um	3831	A
oh well that's hopefully not the essential issue to mankind but uh	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah uh-huh	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
oh really yeah	3831	A
mentality like	3831	A
oh really	3831	A
oh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
hm	3831	A
um	3831	A
oh that's right that's right	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
oh that that's in Arabia	3831	A
um	3831	A
ah	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
well it makes you wonder how- how	3831	A
okay uh	3831	B
yeah Middle East and	3831	B
yeah i guess last week was the uh anniversary of everything but uh	3831	B
that's that's one of those messed up areas i mean it's just	3831	B
i i i think that the whole operation- you know the idea of peace ever being achieved over there is just kind of a	3831	B
i don't know i mean that we're going to have peace you can have maybe some- little more stability that what they have right now but	3831	B
it's just that's pure hatred between the Israelis and the uh Arabs i mean it's just	3831	B
i just don't think they can coexist i mean because they're not ever going to you know	3831	B
it's just too many problems that	3831	B
right	3831	B
uh-huh	3831	B
yeah i'm i'm amazed uh Israel didn't even uh	3831	B
you know retaliate that that that's one of the most surprising things	3831	B
i'm but	3831	B
yeah in fact Baker was uh	3831	B
a speech yesterday trying to get them back they're supposed to be going back to tables pretty soon the next week or two i think but	3831	B
uh they'll you know they'll work out some type of an agreement and something will pop up in about five years and	3831	B
the fact that we never got uh Hussein out hopefully that will fall apart on its own in the next year or so but	3831	B
i mean if he ever gets any type of military power back i mean for that area that's just going to be same situation again and	3831	B
i don't know Bush	3831	B
i just think should have gone in and just take- take him out that would have that was a major problem	3831	B
just him being just	3831	B
he's powerless but still the fact that he's still in power it's over there that's a symbol of	3831	B
he stood up to the evil force of the western world and i mean that's just completely different mode of thinking and	3831	B
to them what they view- view as reality is just simply opposite of what we view but	3831	B
so i it's	3831	B
i just i don't know the only thing that keeps us there is the oil and i guess the only good thing that came out of it is we would be paying twice as much more now for gas but	3831	B
i mean	3831	B
well it is for the money makers out there i guess but	3831	B
i don't know it's it's kind of hard for me to really	3831	B
imagine i mean i've never even been over in that part of the world and i had a friend of mine that got back and	3831	B
he's sort of there and he's just said that he just really he couldn't stand the the	3831	B
uh Saudis at all because_1 he said they just didn't have any respect for them at all and just	3831	B
yeah- they didn't	3831	B
he just really had a hard time you know	3831	B
you know i- i look at it as a he looked at it as a job he wasn't like	3831	B
because_1 he didn't like the people and no one did he said they just didn't they didn't want them over there the people they didn't like them and	3831	B
you know they had all these rules you couldn't bring any type of religious artifacts in or	3831	B
any type of alcohol anything like that he's just	3831	B
and they they have like this they look down at the soldiers- the American soldiers and he said it's just	3831	B
you have a hard time you know fighting for their cause	3831	B
and to me to it's i don't know it's just it's just totally backward everything you know black is white and	3831	B
white is black to them i mean that doesn't make sense but	3831	B
okay i work with uh a lot of students and uh in my uh occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think uh	3884	A
the advice that i give to would give to uh parents i've had four sons- five sons that have gone to college- uh to uh college	3884	A
i think uh one of the main things is that they they choose a local college that uh or university	3884	A
that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if they're in the local area they don't have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things	3884	A
and uh	3884	A
and	3884	A
go ahead	3884	A
uh-huh	3884	A
yes it is	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
uh that that's uh kind of the the advice that i give and then uh they need to take a look at the uh courses- uh the courses of study and uh how it would go into their their major minor field uh	3884	A
what kind of placement uh they have in the particular area you know i had one son who uh went to a smaller college uh to uh went out in the uh premed area	3884	A
but they had an excellent record of placing uh their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was	3884	A
right he got early acceptance to a to medical school after he finished and uh if he would've gone to uh say the state uh it would be the University of Utah	3884	A
if he would've gone there uh i don't know whether he'd got accepted to medical school there or not	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
yes uh	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
and you you can do this for any of the uh any uh university or or for any of the students that are planning uh take a look at uh their final goals at least hopefully they've got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then uh	3884	A
if it's law school or if it's uh medical or whatever	3884	A
there are different uh colleges and universities usually within the state that uh have a little- little better placement record or or getting them into into those higher degree or higher areas of education	3884	A
i see uh-huh	3884	A
um-hum you bet	3884	A
um-hum and uh that would be school- a school that the parents uh should seek out for their uh students if they're interested in that that field and	3884	A
and where it's well known uh the word gets out and that that might be a a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the the uh to to go to to Penn State	3884	A
um-hum yes	3884	A
um-hum you bet	3884	A
um-hum well that's very important in in a choice of a college or university that they look at those aspects uh wherever they might be	3884	A
and if it's uh financially if they can do that that's that's great	3884	A
but they- they need to know about the the costs and uh how they're going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh	3884	A
uh the bottom line is uh the the college or university that's gonna give them the best training prepare them for life	3884	A
um-hum	3884	B
yeah that's certainly helpful	3884	B
say your last suggestion there about	3884	B
staying within state i realize that there are a lot of schools unless uh uh the student has a real specialty	3884	B
and there oh maybe are one or two universities that are highly respected in that field they really ought to try to stay within their state i mean	3884	B
financing in universities now is getting a very very high	3884	B
and they can't help themselves on that either so it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state	3884	B
yeah	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
that's very important	3884	B
well that was certainly uh good advice to get him to go to a school who follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their students that	3884	B
that means that the quality of what he was taught must be very very high	3884	B
and that's good for him too regardless of where he works he has uh a top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
well we have that same situation here i'm i'm a retired professor at Penn State	3884	B
and uh the field i worked in was acoustics	3884	B
and we have an acoustics department here and we- have lots of students several hundred i guess in in acoustics and they have an excellent opportunity to	3884	B
follow through on their fields because our university is well known for it's research in addition to uh teaching obviously if we can do	3884	B
high class research we must be well trained and and uh available to teach the students well	3884	B
yes	3884	B
yes	3884	B
yes because_1 Penn Penn State is very well known in uh many of its uh many- of its fields and	3884	B
uh we we get a lot we do we only we get our sort of say we get state uh students not only from out of state but from all over the world	3884	B
i mean they they they really come here we have a very high uh percentage of foreign students because Penn State is pretty well tops in many of its fields	3884	B
and we have doubled in size in the last fifteen twenty years i guess	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
yes that's true	3884	B
yes and then the basic thing is that you started out earlier to say the the bottom line is to give your	3884	B
declined that	3885	A
San Francisco has more crime than Texas	3885	A
it's a it's a difficult question i don't know that i uh can easily come up with an answer to what can be done	3885	A
i think probably drugs have a lot to do with crime in our society today so	3885	A
no no	3885	A
it's it's hard to know actually whether the	3885	A
crime um impact would	3885	A
be better or would- would decrease or would increase if there were some changes in the way drugs are legislated i don't know if	3885	A
i have uh an opinion yet about uh legalization of certain kinds of drugs but	3885	A
uh-huh boy there's certainly a lot connected with that you know	3885	A
organized crime as well as	3885	A
huh	3885	A
well i guess	3885	A
yeah i grew up in a pretty small town and i'm not sure that um	3885	A
the size of the community or the general appearances safety really has as much to do with it because because you're seen as an enclave You might get hit by somebody from the outside anyway	3885	A
um i guess on a on a local level uh i i was thinking when i heard the question about major changes in the country today but it's probably a little easier now that i think about it if i look at what an individual could do and obviously	3885	A
if you have lights on and you have uh uh a timing system for your lights in your own home you're going to reduce the risk of being broken into	3885	A
right right looking less like a victim	3885	A
neighborhoods watching each other	3885	A
yes	3885	A
in a southern California suburb It was outside of Long Beach kind of near Huntington Beach	3885	A
oh really yeah	3885	A
i've lived in San Francisco for about thirteen years now and um probably have learned by	3885	A
uh indirect and direct experiences about things to do to you know avoid those kind of situations but i think part of it's just as you grow	3885	A
as you mature you you recognize um how to present yourself in a public situation so that you don't look like you are a victim a potential victim	3885	A
it's a hard thing to communicate to kids isn't it	3885	A
i have a two year old	3885	A
no no but you know as a child we were able to uh ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our friends and those are things that i'm not sure i'd be comfortable with when she gets to bike riding age you know	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
that's interesting how large a community is that	3885	A
uh-huh and and Plano what would you say is the population	3885	A
because sometimes it's hard to you know i i look at small towns that have had problems with kidnappings and i think	3885	A
well the you know they're not on the edge of some large metropolis Um you know it's hard to even	3885	A
look at the factors that influence that happening why why in that particular you know	3885	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3885	A
uh-huh do you find yourself teaching your children things that uh you you know that they need to do but you didn't have perhaps in the way of level of awareness at an early age	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
uh-huh how how do they respond to that when you tell them about kidnappings at what age were they ready for that	3885	A
uh-huh how old were were they when you introduced that subject	3885	A
uh-huh huh	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
oh gosh a scary experience	3885	A
than Plano Texas yeah i sure am	3885	B
i don't think there is an answer of what would make crime go away there's no such thing	3885	B
yeah i think you're right	3885	B
have you ever had your house broken into	3885	B
i haven't either	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
that's for sure	3885	B
that's for sure	3885	B
i've never really been a victim of a crime and i've never had my car stolen or my house broken into or	3885	B
any of that so	3885	B
i've always lived in suburbs i don't know if that has anything to do with it or not but	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
right there's so many things that you can do in that way and you know going into parking lots with	3885	B
with your keys out being prepared you know being on the defensive	3885	B
right	3885	B
yeah we have a neighborhood crime watch where i am where did you grow up	3885	B
uh-huh	3885	B
yeah well my girls and i were just just down there this Christmas they play soccer and so we were down in that same area	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
but	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
that's right yep	3885	B
it sure is do you have children	3885	B
yeah they're not afraid of much at two	3885	B
yep i can understand that you know as we were traveling back from that same soccer tournament i was telling you about we stopped in Mesa Arizona	3885	B
and i was just amazed at the freedom that those kids felt they just don't have i mean even here in Plano Texas i worry when my kids	3885	B
walk you know a block	3885	B
and we talked to some of our relatives there and they said you know we just don't worry about that there aren't kidnappings and there aren't	3885	B
there isn't that element here yet	3885	B
um i don't really know it's not real big it's right outside of Tucson	3885	B
uh i don't know that either	3885	B
it's	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
why it would happen here and not there	3885	B
yep	3885	B
i guess you just have to kind of look for a family environment and and neighborhood and hope for the best you know and just	3885	B
sure	3885	B
sure it- and it's so frightening because you have to teach them to be scared all the time	3885	B
and to really be cautious	3885	B
well they don't know any other way they don't know any other way i mean they weren't raised when i was when you didn't worry about that everyone worries about that now so they just assume that you'll always have to be on your guard	3885	B
and this	3885	B
oh real young i mean i can remember when my my oldest daughter is thirteen today	3885	B
and when she was just three i took her to the Sun Valley Mall do you know where that is	3885	B
yeah i grew up there in Concord	3885	B
anyway and um she had gotten lost	3885	B
and it started right then	3885	B
you know and every person i would see that had a little girl you know tucked under their arm i'd run you know	3885	B
to see if that was her	3885	B
oh yeah	3885	B
uh what kind of lawn and garden work do you wind up doing	3842	A
um-hum	3842	A
okay	3842	A
okay	3842	A
okay	3842	A
okay this sounds kind of like slightly jumbled situation there	3842	A
uh that good income huh	3842	A
yes	3842	A
okay	3842	A
yes	3842	A
do- do you enjoy gardening	3842	A
yeah it's real relaxation	3842	A
uh my father ran a service station for thirty nine years and his	3842	A
i mean when- when i was a kid i didn't realize how true it was but he always said that that was the best way he knew of to wind- to wind down after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden	3842	A
and especially you know just hoeing just- hoeing up the weeds it was therapy to him	3842	A
and i guess it still is but uh	3842	A
and i didn't seem that way when i was like ten years old but	3842	A
oh yeah yeah um we had about a quarter of an acre worth of lawn between our my- my parents' house and our next door neighbor	3842	A
they were a rather elderly couple so we cut their lawn for them_1	3842	A
but uh	3842	A
there's about a half acre worth of garden we kept	3842	A
so when the kids and	3842	A
dad we	3842	A
well uh since i moved away from home i got to live in a place that had a yard	3842	A
so i not really	3842	A
yes we've actually gotten to the point where uh for a while i couldn't seem to keep anything alive	3842	A
i couldn't even grow weeds in the house	3842	A
but about three years ago my wife and i somehow another seemed to have turned into green thumbs we got we pinched off a uh a couple- couple of a twigs from a house plant of her mother's	3842	A
and wrapped them in a wet paper towel and brought them_1 home with us	3842	A
and put them_1 in a jar of Miracle Grow and water and these this thing took off and we planted them_1 and now it's a plant uh plant we pinched them off of was kind of full and leafy but it was only about	3842	A
eight inches high off the top of the pot this thing's about five feet tall now	3842	A
and- i don't know	3842	A
it- it's this you know some little broad leaf something or other we	3842	A
but uh it's it's got real thick thick stalks to it that like i say it's the couple of those stalks over five feet tall	3842	A
but uh they're just growing like mad once we got that thing going we wound up with about five or six other house plants that are all doing real well some people gave us some aloe vera and it	3842	A
it's doing well i mean it's had it's bad spots but	3842	A
uh it's had its rough times but yeah but it's it's doing real well now um	3842	A
i brought her a uh a couple of-	3842	A
i don't even know what they're called looks like overly large lawn grass but it just a broad leaf type of lawn net kind of like a a leaf on a stalk of corn but uh greener it's	3842	A
short house plant pardon	3842	A
yeah well it doesn't get a stalk the the leaves all come out of the center it doesn't really resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself it is- about_1 like the shape of a leaf a leaf on a stalk of corn but it's not on a	3842	A
stalk it's just all out of the center	3842	A
yeah and uh it doesn't seem to flower any and let's see we've got a little somebody gave us a Fichus and uh	3842	A
uh when we first got it no well we came close we got really close	3842	A
um when we first got it she kept moving it back and forth from our own front porch to the uh inside and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside	3842	A
and it had shed almost all its leaves it looked really scraggly and rough and when somebody finally told us the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them_1	3842	A
i have um we own a house that we rent out	3842	B
and i- i rent the house that i live in	3842	B
and the house that i'm renting- the house that i live in had the landlord provides the yard work	3842	B
the house that we own i provide the yard work	3842	B
i know well the the one that i live in is not nearly so nice as the one i rent out though-	3842	B
i wanna preserve the the the- value of the house by making sure the yard is taken care of	3842	B
so i- i go over to my other house and mow the yard and plant bulbs and flowers and	3842	B
i adore it	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
yeah	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
did you mow the yard when you were younger or do stuff like that	3842	B
ooh	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
do you still do yard work	3842	B
oh	3842	B
do you do anything anything like um uh house plants or	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
oh gosh	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
ooh what is it	3842	B
oh	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
i killed an aloe vera	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
oh yeah um corn plants those are called corn plants or- or Dracaena or they're some kind of Dracaena but common name's corn plants i think-	3842	B
oh	3842	B
oh huh	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
huh that's i don't i know i have one of those that's not doing very well but	3842	B
i think i know what you're talking about	3842	B
you- you haven't killed it	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
how do you get your news coverage	3886	A
uh-huh	3886	A
oh that's pretty nice	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
right	3886	A
yeah that's just about all i get is the evening news and the and the newspaper sometimes i wish the evening news was like an hour long instead of thirty minutes	3886	A
but that would be nice to have uh um you know- all is it an all news uh radio station	3886	A
uh-huh	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
i- i guess i never i never really tried that it probably is on the AM i know it's not on FM	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
well it's probably picking up um KLBJ that's a real famous	3886	A
um uh Lady Bird used to own it	3886	A
radio station here but um they're not so much news as they are um uh as far as musicians and and things going on around Austin	3886	A
you know	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
some subject yeah	3886	A
well not bad that sounds pretty interesting	3886	A
right	3886	A
oh i guess Dan Rather i'll switch around i'm not really partial you know one like Monday i might have one and Tuesday i might have another one you know just to get a different view	3886	A
you know or just someone different but uh	3886	A
yeah um-hum	3886	A
yeah yeah it's a little draggy	3886	A
yeah until it gets a little boring though i know there is something better on	3886	A
so it- it's pretty nice in that the newspaper here it's it's it's only you only have one newspaper and um it's it's kind of biased	3886	A
but um it it's all right	3886	A
yeah it's very conservative i would say it's very conservative but you know being it's only you- you don't have one in the evening and you don't have a choice	3886	A
and you know i don't i don't like that but other- i have uh uh small newspaper community um that's oh it's- it's um	3886	A
uh just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people and uh it's free and it's real nice	3886	A
yeah i really like it you yeah it- it's like the small hometown newspaper you know you can put your kid's picture in there if they had a birthday or or something like that you know or some	3886	A
well um most of what i do is um listen to the news in the morning when i'm heading to work um	3886	B
we get uh we have two different stations here that run uh National Public Radio and i really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when i'm driving home from work so that's where i get most of my stuff uh	3886	B
yeah we we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the Washington Post here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper	3886	B
and uh so it's you know it's it's uh between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to uh listen to the evening news but not very often how about_1	3886	B
yeah i don't blame you it's it's uh it's	3886	B
yeah and it actually	3886	B
well no i it's i guess what is it it's um it's kind of a talk radio station it's run by a university here called American University or at least that the the general program that i listen to National Public Radio itself is um	3886	B
a uh uh a syndicated thing that's run by a group that operates here in Washington uh but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good	3886	B
especially in Austin come to think of it uh that you're going to be able to get it down there uh	3886	B
yeah	3886	B
well i don't know whatever your you know it it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and uh and so forth and and uh	3886	B
this uh the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize it's kind of a bluegrass station or something	3886	B
um but uh yeah that that's i'm i'm dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special features on Austin it's a real interesting radio program because they they don't just cover-	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um -well that's very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as i'm driving home	3886	B
and um what they do is they they give you uh about a five to ten minute news uh broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they they cover	3886	B
um topics either of current interest or every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on on some uh particular thing like yeah like perhaps- for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah it's uh	3886	B
yeah it's real good and it it it uh the other thing is is is- my politics are kind of liberal and and um so they have a tendency being public radio to	3886	B
sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you you've got to give them_1 credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story	3886	B
and uh they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves either	3886	B
yeah yeah i'm the same way but the the evening news on TV it's it's really it's so short that you just uh i don't feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh McNeil Lehrer report on public TV	3886	B
i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long	3886	B
and uh with- you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i i used to try to watch it used- used to make me feel like oh well this is uh something i should be watching	3886	B
yeah exactly and	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
which way which which way does it lean is it conservative or	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
oh wow	3886	B
that's good yeah	3886	B
well that's interesting-	3886	B
uh probably not from what i've been hearing i mean there's not enough getting done	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
well you think this AIDS thing has been around since about nineteen eighty and	3843	B
i would have thought by now they'd have been a lot more advances	3843	B
in treatment and then again i guess there is i mean there's some drugs that they didn't have and	3843	B
i'm sure that didn't come cheap	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
it's pretty uh	3843	B
yeah i keep thinking that myself	3843	B
i i was i last year when the war thing was going on and it was over and they said it costed you know like seventy billion or something	3843	B
and they said if they had that much money for AIDS research they could have found found a cure	3843	B
so i kind of wondered about that i mean	3843	B
to me that's an astronomical amount of money and uh	3843	B
but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
there again that doesn't seem like a whole lot of money	3843	B
you know if to do something like that with	3843	B
uh but i i kind of agree with you we should spend more in this country for not only AIDS but a lot of other things before we start helping other countries	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
i mean in in in your own financial budget if if you're not doing well you're not going to help out anyone else	3843	B
but but that's not the way this country is or ever been i think we've always	3843	B
they had reasons for it i think i heard one just the other day that	3843	B
because of all the money he was you know giving away right now uh the president was i think his wife said something with well like we've got to keep these countries in a democratic mode	3843	B
uh sometimes i don't think it matters	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
my wife and i used to work at a research laboratory for the government	3843	B
and i know things go slow	3843	B
an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing sometimes	3843	B
so i understand	3843	B
you know where the money gets ate up at and	3843	B
but there really should just be more	3843	B
and now that	3843	B
yeah and now that uh you know the weapon spending is going down	3843	B
but we could put some of these laboratories even like the one we worked at at Los Alamos we could put them onto you know more AIDS things	3843	B
not that i know of	3843	B
i think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the street and i heard a rumor that one of them died with AIDS	3843	B
but i never knew for sure i met them once or twice because they used to sell plants in the yard but	3843	B
i never really considered that i knew them so	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
actually-	3843	B
do you think do we spend enough on that or	3843	A
oh yeah	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah i just kind of wonder uh you know i've been thinking	3843	A
i don't know how much they spend on cancer and how much they spend on AIDS and some of those other things but it seems like uh	3843	A
you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of people that are affected uh cancer seems to affect a lot more people and you'd think they need to spend more on that but	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah that's true it's uh i don't know it's kind of interesting issue you wonder	3843	A
now it's gotten so out of hand that you know it's not just that the homosexual population and stuff like that uh you know it's affected everybody just even if you go to a hospital it's	3843	A
kind of hard to know what to do and	3843	A
you really i don't even think they have really a decent- a decent idea of how many people really have it i	3843	A
i would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and	3843	A
it's kind of a scary-	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
wait whether amongst	3843	A
yeah seventy	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where we're getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country you know or to support the Soviet Union this that and the other and	3843	A
you know i sometimes wonder if it's not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems and you know AIDS being one of them to	3843	A
i think didn't the President put i don't know if it was a billion or so more dollars or something in the budget this well i guess it was in ninety one to try and find a cure for it or	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
yeah it's kind of kind of ironic ourselves we're on the down trend and here we are trying to still pick other people up and	3843	A
seems like that's all we ever do and it comes back to haunt us in the long run	3843	A
but	3843	A
yeah yeah that's true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own house and put your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and	3843	A
yeah i	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
no and and	3843	A
yeah i i i agree that just	3843	A
and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know i guess if we didn't help the Soviet Union there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but	3843	A
you know we're either paying for it in weapons and arms or we're paying we're giving it to them for nothing you know	3843	A
and then we you know at least we have jobs when we're making all the weapons and stuff it seemed like and now we don't even have those because we cut back so much and then we give it away and you just wonder what we really get out of it	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
more money spent	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
well uh do you know that much about i mean have you ever met anybody that has AIDS or	3843	A
yeah i've never met anybody myself but	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
just more passing but	3843	A
yeah i just i haven't had anything strike home so it really hasn't hit me as bad and and sometimes- you know you tend to sometimes wonder well hey you know you kind of brought it on yourself but like i say now it's getting so much more in	3843	A
into society that people that you know have no intention of doing anything you know kind of end up with it and	3843	A
you know little kids and stuff like that that	3843	A
that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to	3843	A
to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other	3843	A
you know type diseases out there it seems you hear a lot more about the AIDS activists than you do these other people with these other diseases and	3843	A
how do you get most of your news	3874	A
what are your favorites on TV for for news programs	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
uh that's terrible i know i should know these but is Dan Rather	3874	A
C B S	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
are you one of those people that tends to like to go through the paper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something or do you tend to like to read at the end of the day	3874	A
yes that's the way i am	3874	A
oh that's nice	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
right	3874	A
yeah	3874	A
oh really	3874	A
sometimes it feels as though what i'm reading in the newspaper is the old news it's as if i heard it just the day before on the television and i wonder where they get a lot of their stories but i think that	3874	A
the one that i'm i feel like i get the most information from is is uh McNeil Lehrer and sometimes it's on in the afternoon if i'm if i'm home but i work most the time so um	3874	A
the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal because	3874	A
yes you're preparing dinner but you still have an opportunity to to look at it occasionally we have a little two year old so there's not a lot of time to for me i feel to spend as much time with the	3874	A
updates as i'd like to i think i probably get more of it from Lee because he works out of our home and um	3874	A
it it seems to me that McNeil Lehrer spends more time with each issue therefore i can count on it being more accurate uh because they've really spent more	3874	A
development of the story as well as research and	3874	A
and i get a better picture of what it is that i'm hearing about i- i wonder about the authenticity of the others um i- i have a feeling they get a lot from UPI and AP and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and	3874	A
just give little spots to it and	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
right and certainly in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press from some activities because they didn't want to have a lot of political fall out i think but there was probably	3874	A
some repetition of of stories that didn't have complete um confirmation i wondered that about the whole Clinton thing recently um you know something coming out in the tabloids and being picked up by a major media	3874	A
uh one of the accusations obviously is that they didn't go down there and research it and and get enough information i don't have a preference or an opinion really on that story one way or the other but it's uh	3874	A
yes	3874	A
this is true	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
uh-huh but it is always interesting to hear the follow ups you know on any kind of major presentation you always get the analysis	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
well they all have their perceptions too you know they may have heard the exact same thing and that's just their	3874	A
well that's a a good question um	3874	B
i read the newspaper obviously and and watch TV	3874	B
and uh	3874	B
uh we have one here at at at six o'clock in the evening to seven where we have local news followed by uh	3874	B
and i- i- i can't name the CBS i guess it is	3874	B
who is- who is the gentleman that uh	3874	B
MC's that program	3874	B
yeah i think in fact- i think it's Dan Rather yeah i- i- i have uh been- just retired recently so i have had very little time really to watch	3874	B
TV and uh to get the news so all of my time that was available was between about six and seven uh obviously i scan the newspaper	3874	B
and um i think	3874	B
no	3874	B
i get mine at the end of the day	3874	B
i at least i used to and now i'm beginning to read it about noon since i just retired i- i retired from Penn State and i just uh now i have some morning time available	3874	B
and it used to be that we got our newspapers in the evening which i liked because that's when i could read it and i felt like it was fresh	3874	B
and for the last two or three years our newspapers have been coming early in the morning and it's been six or seven o'clock at night before i got to read it	3874	B
and i had already heard all kinds of conflicting things during the day before i read a newspaper	3874	B
yes	3874	B
uh	3874	B
uh-huh	3874	B
well that's my normal time six to seven for here	3874	B
um-hum	3874	B
how do you feel about the authenticity of these various uh methods of presenting- of representing the news	3874	B
yes i always wonder about the accuracy of their source of information that's what bothers me particularly you know when we're had this business of the of the war over there in Europe i mean i always wondered about	3874	B
it that they based what they said on whoever told them well whoever told them_1 might not necessarily have the accurate news and know of the overall- know the overall	3874	B
story	3874	B
yeah	3874	B
um-hum	3874	B
well then the the only thing that you can be sure of the uh has gotten it straight from the horse so to speak is did you hear uh President Bush's speech the other night	3874	B
well at least we know what he said	3874	B
and we we don't have to to uh read in the newspaper what they think he said or what the Democrats think he said we know what we heard him say	3874	B
yes	3874	B
that's when you find out of all the disturbances that are in the background that know one else knows about that's the problem when you're in a politics	3874	B
there's always somebody working behind your back and- who just doesn't want you to get your way simply- because_1 you're on the other team well that's ridiculous really	3874	B
yeah yep	3874	B
never did worked for a lot of computer companies in my life but not that not TI	3848	A
uh	3848	A
credit cards	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
sounds like a good you ready to get started	3848	A
okay	3848	A
i stay away from them no	3848	A
uh i keep two i keep uh i got a Visa and it keeps a little balance on it not much and American Express is the one i use predominantly so i know i have to pay it every month	3848	A
i know when i was younger twenty years ago or so i i got into quite a bit of hassle with them charging to the limit like to never caught them up	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
i've had oh one time i had an erroneous charge show up on it from some	3848	A
credit card protection company or something and that took me a few months to get that reimbursed and uh find out what was going on there they had authorized they had paid somebody without my authorization	3848	A
and	3848	A
i think the final letter was they were sorry that happened	3848	A
boy	3848	A
yeah i've never gotten into an interest	3848	A
never gotten into an interest charge with American Express i know they have it but i just	3848	A
you know if you get it paid within the next thirty days or something you don't have one so	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
yeah it's kind of hard to get by without one you know it's	3848	A
i rent a lot of videos you got to have one there and different places and so you just about got to have a major credit card my favorites though are department store credit cards	3848	A
uh you can just stop in and shop when you want and don't have to worry about your check book or having cash	3848	A
and	3848	A
i found out with at least the two department stores we've done business with for years they treat you much nicer	3848	A
uh when you have a balance you pay it and	3848	A
there's never a problem with anything you want or anything uh and our give give the cards to my sons say here go get what you want	3848	A
that sort of thing	3848	A
so those kind of particular credit cards i've always liked	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
right when i work that's the way we uh i had a	3848	A
corporate card with American Express with my company and	3848	A
everything was put on that they didn't care what was put on there just	3848	A
and i i usually	3848	A
i think one time in all those years i had a situation where my refund check you know my reimbursement checks hadn't gotten here in time to make you know a payment of five or six thousand i had every month too and	3848	A
i mean just one time	3848	A
um okay	3848	B
subject is credit cards and how we use them	3848	B
okay	3848	B
i guess so	3848	B
now what's been your experience with credit cards	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
well i i uh i belonged to American Express many years ago	3848	B
and uh they had a reputation or at least they touted that uh don't go don't leave home without it type attitude that it was good in Europe and everywhere	3848	B
and i went on traveled in Europe and i was just absolutely appalled at uh	3848	B
the they it was useless	3848	B
and uh i think uh	3848	B
being overseas for about five weeks there was three occasions i got to use the card	3848	B
uh one little hotel out in the middle of nowhere in Scotland one little restaurant in Denmark and things like that	3848	B
and uh later i uh well i get in a scrap with uh American Express because they made some mistakes in my account and it just took too many letters to get it straightened out	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
well i	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
well it was something i don't remember the exact details so long ago uh they tried to sell me some kind of a special card	3848	B
you know gold card or super card or diamond card and so to do that they had to change my account	3848	B
and so	3848	B
some bills came in under the old account after they transferred all the money out	3848	B
and rather than credit you know move the bills to the new account and pay them off as they should they sent me this statement showing this huge interest charge on uh	3848	B
on the account	3848	B
and it took took me a while to get that straightened out	3848	B
yeah well i tried writing letters to get it straightened out but it uh it took about eight months and i finally said cancel the account and	3848	B
after about four months they quit sending me letters	3848	B
uh	3848	B
and now i only carry one really uh my wife insisted that i get another credit card and uh so i do have a Visa card	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
uh-huh	3848	B
yeah well i have another credit card our company when you travel uh because of the tax regulations they don't like to make cash advances	3848	B
uh because there's uh they're concerned with the tax liability there so uh rather than make a uh cash advance they issue a credit card and you just charge as you go	3848	B
and uh	3848	B
send your paper work in and by the time the credit card bill comes in presumably you have your check from the company the	3848	B
in dollars and lives and the long term effects	3834	A
you ready i i'll hit it if you're ready to start okay	3834	A
my name's Karen by the way what what's your name	3834	A
San Francisco	3834	A
oh nice to meet you	3834	A
ready to go	3834	A
what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war	3834	A
you you think it was a winnable war then	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
you mean the effects of of of Vietnam being to encourage him to to be more defensive in his posture and go for	3834	A
i meant offensive i'm sorry uh-huh	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
um	3834	A
i do think one of the effects was that the uh people involved in that kind of an um activity were surprised at the power that the media had on um intervening and probably	3834	A
set the tone for media's involvement in future whether it was a war activity or	3834	A
something along those lines that are going to involve a number of people	3834	A
everything changed after that in terms of media	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
well you remember in the Gulf War they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in	3834	A
Vietnam war they weren't about to have people out in there reporting	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
um	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least	3834	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	B
well uh	3834	B
oh i'm ready yeah sure	3834	B
Karen my name's John Benyak where do you live	3834	B
oh i live in Dallas	3834	B
just outside of Dallas	3834	B
nice talking to you	3834	B
what's that mean we're ready to go	3834	B
okay well it uh the way it turned out it wasn't worth anything really i just don't think i've always thought that uh	3834	B
it just wasn't carried on the way it should have been it wasn't carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just uh	3834	B
we	3834	B
well i think we'd uh we'd uh beat them i don't think uh	3834	B
i don't know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but uh i think if we'd uh had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war	3834	B
instead of letting the politicians and the	3834	B
and the peace and people like that dictate the terms of the way we fought i think things would have turned out a lot differently	3834	B
oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and uh or at least it is now and there's no way	3834	B
that if we'd uh been able to take uh	3834	B
use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have uh what would have lost it as a war uh the long term effects well	3834	B
i uh i don't know that's that's a little tougher to answer i think uh	3834	B
depends i guess on who's in office but uh i think Bush used that uh last year in the Persian Gulf uh by taking some stronger stronger measures and when the war started	3834	B
be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they decided-	3834	B
once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much uh	3834	B
run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in Vietnam is that uh they we escalated and uh just you know on a gradual basis and gave the	3834	B
um North Vietnamese and Viet Cong time to adjust to our uh	3834	B
increases in uh personnel and so forth they just didn't go in there if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially uh i think things would have been differently but different but it uh they went from	3834	B
having the advisors uh up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the uh	3834	B
the enemy just gradually adjusted to that and	3834	B
they didn't uh the people the country the people here didn't want the war the way it turned out they didn't want it that's	3834	B
uh-huh	3834	B
right	3834	B
oh really	3834	B
right well there are	3834	B
yeah there were every every night you'd come home from work and uh or school or whatever and see it on the uh the news i	3834	B
imagine that wasn't the case during World War Two or any of the other wars uh people just didn't feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of	3834	B
a lot of	3834	B
uh-huh	3834	B
right	3834	B
right yeah but uh i just uh	3834	B
i i guess i was in my let's see	3834	B
my twenties during during most of that war and i i never did think that they were they were doing it right i i'm just not a uh a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her i mean that she'd go around speaking on different campuses and	3834	B
getting people uh aroused about the whole thing and of course uh they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that's what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority and	3834	B
people were listening to to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt	3834	B
i was in the service at that time i wasn't over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn't fight it like they should have and it's a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you're over there and	3834	B
people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and	3834	B
either win or lose based on the fact that it's a war and not just uh uh mealy mouth their their way through the thing and try to get the um other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth	3834	B
oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have lost- i i i just don't think we could have lost the the	3834	B
okay so what- now what are your opinions on recycling	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
yeah i've heard that too	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them_1 and uh that's- i can't remember where i went to take them_1 but they wouldn't- they wouldn't take them_1	3876	B
oh i know	3876	B
there's no really recycling facilities	3876	B
i think that's a good idea	3876	B
besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in New York or isn't it	3876	B
um-hum you get ticketed if you don't do it right	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle	3876	B
yeah that's true	3876	B
yeah i've seen them_1	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
that take them_1 back	3876	B
is Texas one of them_1	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at JC Penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling	3876	B
program that's um company wide and i do the recycling for that	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use	3876	B
but um we use to have uh i mean i- i don't even remember how much money that they've um mean- i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities but i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didn't you think of that before	3876	B
yeah that's true	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like	3876	B
then that's pollution	3876	B
yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
truly sad	3876	B
well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility	3876	A
until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late	3876	A
you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand	3876	A
and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my paper- i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take	3876	A
plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them_1	3876	A
and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait -until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile	3876	A
um-hum	3876	A
yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that cannot- glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to	3876	A
no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out	3876	A
and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
i think so it's just because they have to you know	3876	A
right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and	3876	A
so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state i'm from	3876	A
uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay	3876	A
ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back	3876	A
you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just	3876	A
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i don't know if you've tried it	3876	A
and they have on the back- it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that	3876	A
yeah well what- some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now	3876	A
Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them_1 away cause there is no place to take glass	3876	A
so	3876	A
uh-huh	3876	A
okay do they save like the paper they- they use like the office paper good because_1 there is a lot of waste there isn't there	3876	A
right	3876	A
right	3876	A
right	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton	3876	A
you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business	3876	A
and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that	3876	A
yeah yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it	3876	A
and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried	3876	A
and i don't know it just may overwhelm us	3876	A
here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late	3876	A
very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well	3876	A
that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
and then just like the glass bottles that- that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and there's no place i can take glass to	3876	A
so i still throw away a lot of glass	3876	A
yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic-	3876	A
yes i do i uh go on long walks whenever i can and uh	3827	B
well when i when i can fit it into my schedule and the weather's right i like to walk uh oh three four miles a day	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well that sort of same sort of thing happened to me i used to be a regular swimmer i i taught at a university and i you know could use the pool every day if i wanted and since moving away from the university environment i've uh	3827	B
now it's kind of difficult to find a pool that's convenient and affordable to swim in	3827	B
but uh what university were you at	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
did you say you're at the University of Iowa Iowa City huh	3827	B
i went- i visited- visited there once quite a few years ago had a friend who was in the linguistics department there	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well you would do you have contact with any of the uh people in linguistics	3827	B
yeah	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well if you ever run into uh to Cathy Reagan say hi to her for me i think she's still there	3827	B
um-hum	3827	B
well how briskly do you walk do you think how how fast do you walk do you think	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well a brisk walker can go maybe what four or five miles an hour so if it takes you a third of an hour to get in you're probably going oh i would say at least a mile and a half probably	3827	B
yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go walking just about anytime i want to	3827	B
this winter though it's rained so much that uh there've been times where see my uh favorite	3827	B
uh area to walk is a a greenbelt they have right through Plano here and uh	3827	B
you know it's it surrounds a little stream over much- much of its extent you can walk for miles there and never cross a street you you go under the streets	3827	B
but uh when the uh when the water is too high uh you'd get washed away i mean they have signs up there warning people to stay away so	3827	B
we've had that uh a number of times recently not to mention the mud of course	3827	B
well you can get you can do the other thing i do is uh i have a little exercise bike that uh wasn't too expensive i got a cheap one but you can really work up a sweat on it	3827	B
yeah	3827	B
yeah i- i really prefer outdoor exercise i'm afraid that my favorite indoor exercise is eating apple pie a la mode and that doesn't help very much	3827	B
um Ashley um do you exercise regularly	3827	A
uh-huh well that's pretty good i unfortunately uh am not um exercising regularly at the time um	3827	A
i	3827	A
we've recently made a move i used to be at the university where there's facilities there and my wife and i regularly played um racquetball	3827	A
but um since we've moved to Iowa now um we don't have as many facilities like that um	3827	A
i was at Brigham Young University	3827	A
um actually i am working at a university right now i just graduated with my PhD at Brigham Young and i'm working at the University of Iowa however	3827	A
we had all free benefits for faculty and staff and students at Brigham Young but um	3827	A
oh it's we the benefits here as far as um using the physical facilities are not free here so and plus they're not as convenient we're we're further away so it's not as convenient for like my wife to come in you know for doing things together	3827	A
uh-huh right uh-huh	3827	A
oh	3827	A
i'm in uh	3827	A
at the National Center for Voice and Speech which is part of the um Department of Speech Pathology	3827	A
um	3827	A
well uh	3827	A
i just- i haven't been here uh uh only for several months and uh i- i'm sure that there must be some cooperation between the departments but uh i'm not aware of anything as yet	3827	A
um	3827	A
i	3827	A
okay	3827	A
okay usually when the temperatures are warmer um i live about twenty minutes from school so um	3827	A
from the university so i often will walk in which i guess it's i'm not sure how far it is um actually it's twenty five minutes and it's probably about a mile- i don't know long- it's got to be maybe a	3827	A
what	3827	A
oh i walk rather briskly but i don't i don't do it during these winter months it's just far too cold um	3827	A
so-	3827	A
yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um	3827	A
uh-huh	3827	A
uh-huh	3827	A
oh	3827	A
oh yeah	3827	A
but-	3827	A
yeah if i were to begin- to begin exercise now i think it'd be something that i could do um	3827	A
indoors something that's convenient	3827	A
um	3827	A
you know	3827	A
-it's like an exercise bike or something like that although i haven't purchased one purchased one yet sometimes i do- i have this little trampoline-	3827	A
small type trampoline that i do indoor jogging on sometimes for exercise but i haven't really started- been doing anything regular for the last several months since we've since we've moved to to Iowa	3827	A
well outdoor exercise is uh more convenient however-	3827	A
the federal budget boy	3894	B
i was just writing something down that	3894	B
came to mind as i observed what's happened in our society	3894	B
um	3894	B
we i think have become	3894	B
uh dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that really only we can do for ourself	3894	B
and i think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to that	3894	B
uh	3894	B
we have elected people who really don't know how to manage	3894	B
the money uh they collect	3894	B
i mean i think it really affects all of us to a degree Glen i think we are i mean i- i went through a P H D program that was funded by the Office of Navel Research that's now investigating Stanford and Harvard and MIT	3894	B
i mean we're talking about things that have done some good but have institutionalized corruption	3894	B
right well and we need to spend the money better i mean we do not need eight hundred military bases around the world	3894	B
there are lot of things we don't we don't need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we don't need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy farm- i mean basically	3894	B
you know it it is really true that this this country is suffering because um we are it's not that we don't have the resources we are just squandering them	3894	B
that's the way it was working on a defense department contract that's what happened-	3894	B
right well that's the way the that's the way the thing works	3894	B
that's right i've seen that happen and it's it what's even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations	3894	B
is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because we're the smart guys and without us society can't function and that that's no license to steal	3894	B
i mean i- i honest to God believe that's what- what's been going on and that was sort of seeped into the way we operated in those contexts	3894	B
and at the time i you know people i mean it was it was acceptable it's no longer acceptable	3894	B
right	3894	B
right and it it's not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldn't survive	3894	B
and do a a you know variety of other things if we put the money in the right place which is investing in people in the development of human capital	3894	B
in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought they'd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and	3894	B
right	3894	B
well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they haven't been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard MIT or Stanford education if it's that good and you really	3894	B
right but all the people who who are responsible for handling these kids were trained in universities and colleges	3894	B
okay and my point is hey wait a minute something's wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if it's the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around	3894	B
okay so ask yourself some questions why don't we have a higher quality with one of the world's great universities Harvard and Stanford both have schools of education	3894	B
i mean this is a focus it's not like this isn't an interest of theirs this is a specific focus two of the best funded institutions in the country	3894	B
premier universities in the world hey wait a minute how come they can't produce something like MTV which kids want	3894	B
yes	3894	A
i agree with that	3894	A
well what we've got um in my view is is a situation where	3894	A
we've got more people like you say that are customed- that are accustomed to being taken care of and than we	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
yeah well i- i really i think if you from a	3894	A
yeah i- i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think we're gonna have to eventually balance the budget or we're gonna sink	3894	A
we can't continue to pay the kind of interest that we're paying on the deficit	3894	A
that's true	3894	A
oh yeah throwing them away uh it's just like uh uh programs that are federally funded that if they if the they don't spend their allotment uh	3894	A
then they're then they're subject to losing the next year's allotment	3894	A
yeah and go into a spending frenzy at the year of the end- at year end	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
right that's true	3894	A
well and	3894	A
well and- well and so many people have have uh the feeling that well if it's if there if it's federal money then it's free money well it's not it costs everybody	3894	A
and uh it- you know just because you can uh get something from the feds uh uh that doesn't necessarily make it morally uh responsible	3894	A
well and and and well don't even began to talk about the educational system i mean is that is one example where it's being proven that throwing money does not create a good education okay-	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
yeah but i'm even talking- i'm i'm not even i'm not even talking about higher education we're- i'm talking about the the kids that we've got now they come out of high school that can't read and write	3894	A
and that also it just even the ones that that do read and write that really have a very poor poor grasp of of what a secondary education should have given them	3894	A
uh true	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
right	3894	A
uh i crochet uh in in fact uh that's what i was doing when the phone rang	3892	B
yeah i'm making a baby Afghan uh for my daughter-in-law's sister-in-law who's expecting baby number one at age forty	3892	B
so i feel uh i feel like she needs a goody	3892	B
uh-huh	3892	B
oh my	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
no i- i really don't uh in fact this is the first thing i've crocheted in in uh some time	3892	B
but uh my grandmother taught me to crochet when i was five years old which is a long long long time ago	3892	B
so but i- i don't knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the the gauge doesn't work	3892	B
uh	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
hum i know i know	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
yeah well i'll tell you how i sort of feel about it	3892	B
i- i feel like uh of course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity	3892	B
but it- it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else is doing it	3892	B
uh the the if it's not real recreation	3892	B
it's- it's it's not doing you any good	3892	B
uh-huh	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
no no it doesn't it you either do it or or you either like it or you don't you either have a knack for it or you don't uh	3892	B
and and and uh again i- i feel like that	3892	B
if there's something else that you'd rather do uh	3892	B
some people have a natural green thumb	3892	B
uh and uh if that's what you like to do fine but if you don't	3892	B
then uh get a second job and hire somebody	3892	B
do something that you like to do uh	3892	B
life is too short uh	3892	B
i enjoy crocheting it it's real recreational- recreation for me but	3892	B
uh and and i used to sew a lot but uh and i just don't have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending	3892	B
but uh you know uh if you don't like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and uh	3892	B
hum-um dump it	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
well what hobbies do you have	3892	A
oh you do	3892	A
are you making an Afghan	3892	A
oh how wonderful	3892	A
oh my goodness	3892	A
well i have a sister-in-law who had a baby at age	3892	A
forty and i think again at forty three so she's	3892	A
but i'm expecting too so on my first	3892	A
but um i don't uh the only thing i really have done in the past is um	3892	A
uh cross stitch and needlepoint	3892	A
um i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels	3892	A
where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven	3892	A
i've done that kind of stuff but i haven't done anything as big as an Afghan	3892	A
do you do that often	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
hum	3892	A
um-hum yeah that	3892	A
um i just haven't been	3892	A
oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt	3892	A
um i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that that make them_1 but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays	3892	A
you know because i work full-time outside the home	3892	A
and then you don't have the time because_1 you're tending to the child	3892	A
but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things	3892	A
right	3892	A
hum	3892	A
yeah i think that's true um like some people make uh um decorating their house a hobby	3892	A
and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that	3892	A
you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does	3892	A
and so uh you know we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a cop out but yet	3892	A
if if i- i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it	3892	A
but um my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with age and with years of experience- you know	3892	A
hum	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
yeah	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
um-hum um-hum	3892	A
yeah	3892	A
yeah isn't that true	3892	A
we uh in fact mending it- you- even kind of has gone by the wayside for some- most for many people if they get a hole in their sock	3892	A
they don't darn it they they uh	3892	A
uh throw it away and buy a new pair	3892	A
but um	3892	A
yeah there's a lot of things that i think that i'd like to do	3892	A
but i don't make the time to do them_1 you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then i'll have more time to do it and um	3892	A
because_1 i like committing a a great amount of time to something if i'm working on it	3892	A
hello how you doing i'm Lee with uh uh i'm over here in Plano Texas	3830	A
oh sure	3830	A
oh	3830	A
where are you calling from or where are you at	3830	A
Arlington well there's a	3830	A
lot of	3830	A
stuff going on in Arlington these days	3830	A
are you involved in any of that no	3830	A
well uh what benefits uh do- now do you work	3830	A
oh you are	3830	A
okay	3830	A
yeah because_1 i- i work for myself and so uh	3830	A
uh there's a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come but uh	3830	A
oh is that right	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
yeah i uh i own part of a roofing company	3830	A
in the in the Dallas Fort Worth area	3830	A
and uh you- you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we we had all the benefits there and and i do miss that you know but uh on the other hand i	3830	A
i uh	3830	A
i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and	3830	A
being able to you know work when i want and	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
oh is that right	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
it's a	3830	A
yeah it really- probably- it probably- yeah i'll tell you what that is the single most uh benefit that i that i	3830	A
enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just	3830	A
and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it	3830	A
and uh yeah	3830	A
oh yeah even at a group rate uh it's it's unbelievable and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's	3830	A
that eats even more so yeah i guess what the other benefits that uh	3830	A
that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the	3830	A
bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know and course these days you can't count on that because	3830	A
uh you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh	3830	A
GM deal there in in Arlington and i'm i'm sure it'll be you know quite a few people are affected by that so	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
oh really	3830	A
is that right	3830	A
the Union yeah	3830	A
is that right	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
well really the	3830	A
yeah really the ones it's gonna hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area you know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh	3830	A
oh yeah	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
um-hum	3830	A
well i tell you i i've had my fill of unions i use-	3830	A
oh yeah-	3830	A
hello fine	3830	B
okay let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off okay	3830	B
okay	3830	B
Arlington Arlington Texas yes	3830	B
yes not all good stuff	3830	B
no no i'm not not personally	3830	B
i'm going to school right now i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what i think i've got a lot of	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
yes right	3830	B
yes	3830	B
yes i've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact i'm selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having	3830	B
that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits weren't there so	3830	B
oh do you yeah	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
yeah	3830	B
right	3830	B
yep um-hum	3830	B
i think today the thing that i uh	3830	B
would appreciate the most uh because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine	3830	B
and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured	3830	B
i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to have- you need to have	3830	B
right	3830	B
it's out of sight right it's out of sight	3830	B
even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our	3830	B
right it goes up right	3830	B
um-hum	3830	B
right	3830	B
right	3830	B
right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the GM people come in when they were they would shut down to retool	3830	B
they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this right- yes	3830	B
they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and	3830	B
every Friday and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these great- i- i really believe they have done this to themselves	3830	B
in a way because of the unions being so strong	3830	B
and right now anybody that's laid off from GM will have a full year's paycheck	3830	B
i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at	3830	B
at uh through the company so i'm sorry- you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check and that would be it	3830	B
yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah	3830	B
but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them_1 in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know	3830	B
and it made the prices of cars go up and	3830	B
and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far	3830	B
i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour	3830	B
i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour	3830	B
convenience uh	3854	B
i- i use them_1 for just- uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard	3854	B
but um i- i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um	3854	B
uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one	3854	B
uh has a twenty dollar- it's a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i- i pay off every month	3854	B
there's no interest charge	3854	B
but and we never carry over we pay off every month	3854	B
well one thing is whenever we rent a car we don't have to pay um any extra insurance	3854	B
so that we uh my husband's uh family lives in New Hampshire	3854	B
and uh	3854	B
it's about_1 ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston	3854	B
so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car	3854	B
so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
oh dear	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
yeah uh-huh	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
um	3854	B
can can you buy groceries with it	3854	B
uh-huh yeah	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
yeah i think so too	3854	B
no it's not	3854	B
yeah you really can and uh also um	3854	B
we travel abroad	3854	B
some	3854	B
and um it um you get MasterCard's accepted everywhere and and you get the	3854	B
a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in traveler's checks of course there are	3854	B
yeah and and even uh converting your traveler's checks at a bank they still charge you a fee	3854	B
and uh	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
yeah um-hum um-hum	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
yeah we do too	3854	B
do you use credit cards	3854	A
it	3854	A
do you	3854	A
uh-huh	3854	A
i see	3854	A
what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you don't pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa	3854	A
i see	3854	A
i see we used to get the American Express card and	3854	A
stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um	3854	A
benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so	3854	A
uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we don't do	3854	A
or other types of services i'm sure there're some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh i've just wondered what they were they haven't been appealing to us so far	3854	A
yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know you've arrived you've got this card	3854	A
and uh	3854	A
you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh	3854	A
so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i don't know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the Visa- Visa and MasterCard and they said fine we'll give it to you anyway	3854	A
and we said you know	3854	A
so	3854	A
they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and	3854	A
it's wonderful in that respect and we're glad to have them_1 we we	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
it's great you know and it eventually what we're gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and it'll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i don't think the Discover card's gonna make it in the long term	3854	A
um you know we don't need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but it'll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because_1 the price will come down	3854	A
i don't think it's worth fifty five bucks a year	3854	A
when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and they're pitching that in all their commercials i notice	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
well now- now that's interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the conversion fee probably	3854	A
right	3854	A
well it it's gonna come that way and the reason it's nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources	3854	A
anywhere in the world and that's where we're headed the technology supports that nicely	3854	A
and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen	3854	A
and you don't get uh anything charged to you and that's great it's just insurance we're very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them	3854	A
it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever	3854	A
um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA	3854	A
yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh that's a great thing for-	3854	A
what do you think about drug testing	3808	A
yeah i think that it's appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and	3808	A
you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other people you know health professionals and people who	3808	A
uh operate machinery and fly and or drive whatever i think that those are really important i'm not sure how i feel about about other jobs just	3808	A
uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is	3808	A
drug free you know on on general principles	3808	A
but i can really see the justification for the others	3808	A
uh-huh for all job categories	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
so whether you're an executive behind a desk or you're operating a vehicle or whatever	3808	A
and- and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean	3808	A
so in the past month	3808	A
oh since nineteen ninety one it started is that right	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
when you say infrequent is it maybe once a quarter or	3808	A
how large is that group	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that	3808	A
that the company chose to do that	3808	A
was it insurance issue or	3808	A
safety issue	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
so uh on a performance level there was actually	3808	A
a problem with abuse of substances and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
yeah	3808	A
what kind of a company is it	3808	A
oh i guess i should have figured anybody i talk to in Texas is- is probably from TI	3808	A
interesting well	3808	A
they really i guess i shouldn't stray from the subject but they have some very interesting topics for for questions	3808	A
i often wonder who has created them	3808	A
was the response from the employees regarding drug testing favorable or	3808	A
oh really	3808	A
interesting quit on general principle	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
uh-huh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and	3808	A
be interpreted correctly	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
do you know if anyone's been uh	3808	A
um	3808	A
disciplined or	3808	A
so even if it's you know one time	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that	3808	A
well	3808	B
unnecessary- a necessary evil i guess	3808	B
well	3808	B
yeah uh i guess i'm uh	3808	B
partly biased since we just recently our company's gone to the uh process of	3808	B
initiating drug testing on a random basis	3808	B
everybody uh in the corporation	3808	B
that's correct	3808	B
well it's uh	3808	B
other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and	3808	B
and supervision taking the uh being done within the first year	3808	B
which we've all been done you know	3808	B
uh seems to be	3808	B
the past year	3808	B
uh right actually- late in ninety it was	3808	B
but you know they it's fairly infrequent it's just that it's there you know	3808	B
oh Lord no i don't think uh	3808	B
first of all in my group	3808	B
hardly a fourth of them have been tested you know	3808	B
uh it's about uh twenty people	3808	B
well	3808	B
that uh they want to you know social uh issues	3808	B
yeah i think that	3808	B
that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh	3808	B
Texas Instruments	3808	B
yeah	3808	B
yeah i guess there uh	3808	B
may have been just a committee throwing out suggestions	3808	B
it was uh it was received at our site here in Houston	3808	B
fairly easily however in Austin where they have a lot of engineers and uh	3808	B
i guess a younger set uh people they uh they were pretty uh a lot of people quit over it and uh quite a	3808	B
quite a bit of furor yeah	3808	B
i guess yeah there was some people that just actually quit because of the	3808	B
their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know	3808	B
uh i don't know how much of that there is i don't think it's that big of an issue because they've hired a national company and it's you know handled	3808	B
third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that	3808	B
oh yes they've they've they've been people that have been uh	3808	B
the company has a	3808	B
you get a two step process the first time if you're caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if you're not you know	3808	B
still have to go into a program even	3808	B
yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user or whatever	3808	B
then uh after that first time- chance then the second time it's automatic termination so	3808	B
yeah well it's	3808	B
it's almost become a uh non topic anymore-	3808	B
okay here we go so what's your favorite team	3814	A
naturally huh	3814	A
oh really	3814	A
it's um like seventy five miles from Oakland and San Francisco	3814	A
it's in the valley	3814	A
okay	3814	A
well i used to be a Raider fan when they were there but now i'm a 49er fan	3814	A
you know and the 49ers just went down down down this year	3814	A
yeah	3814	A
yeah- yeah right right	3814	A
so what- what do you think's gonna happen Sunday	3814	A
i hope it's Buffalo	3814	A
you know i'm really i'm	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
yeah lost by what one point	3814	A
yeah	3814	A
uh-huh	3814	A
well at least Dallas was in the play-offs you know	3814	A
yeah	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
um-hum do you get to go to very many games	3814	A
uh-huh	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
hm um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
no i've never been to a 49er game i used to go to all the Raider games when they were in Oakland and	3814	A
uh it would be nice yeah but uh i don't think that's ever gonna happen	3814	A
you know um now i'm just waiting for something to come out- out this way out in the valley	3814	A
Sacramento still has a chance i guess of getting a team someday	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
so you plan on uh watching the game Sunday	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
well that'll be nice- yeah that'll be nice yeah we're gonna have a little few people over to watch the game you know just serve hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that so we won't have to miss out on anything	3814	A
so	3814	A
i know it's too late huh	3814	A
yeah i was wondering for sure what time it started i thought it was three or something but you say it's four out here huh	3814	A
six o'clock your time huh that's terrible	3814	A
yeah yeah yeah	3814	A
well	3814	A
yeah um okay then it's been nice talking to you Brad all right bye-bye	3814	A
so uh	3814	B
uh Cowboy fan die hard	3814	B
yeah ever since i was last sixteen seventeen years well- as long as i can remember yeah ever since seventy six but um yeah big time they are uh	3814	B
everyone's jumping on the bandwagon now after the season they had what part of Patterson	3814	B
and- that uh that California is that	3814	B
oh okay so you're up-	3814	B
okay	3814	B
so i guess you're uh	3814	B
yeah	3814	B
there you go there you go	3814	B
yeah but if they would've made- to the play-offs i mean they were they were the hottest team i thought at the end of the season it's just it's kind of	3814	B
it's kind of bad that they miss out on the play-offs with a tie breaker or whatever but	3814	B
that	3814	B
uh i think it's um Buffalo	3814	B
i- i really do i think it's their time to	3814	B
everyone's picking Washington but	3814	B
i don't know i mean i think the AFC's been getting beat up every year you know lost a few Super Bowls	3814	B
because_1 they went last year they should have won it and you know missed that kick but	3814	B
yeah pretty bad for the kicker but	3814	B
i think they'll do it i mean naturally Redskins	3814	B
and the Cowboys don't have a	3814	B
much like for each other but um	3814	B
yeah it's	3814	B
the- the way they went out that- didn't go over and it got killed by Detroit but they're young team i mean they got all those draft picks next year i mean their future's	3814	B
i mean they're one of the young i mean they got so many stars and with Jimmy Johnson i mean you never know what he's gonna do it's just that guy's a wizard drafting people	3814	B
i went to four games this year actually um	3814	B
friends of mine have season tickets we've always- it's always um each year we've taken turns in getting them_1 and kind of	3814	B
switched around on them_1 everything and i just graduated and i moved back so i got to see more games finally	3814	B
i went to school at Texas Tech out in Lubbock Texas for last four years so i saw the games on TV but i hadn't been to any since yeah Thanksgiving once i guess	3814	B
so you make any- many 49er games	3814	B
yeah i guess it- still want them_1 back in Oakland huh	3814	B
yeah i guess there's not many Al Davis fans out there	3814	B
uh you got just- so many	3814	B
yeah there's so many teams out in California though i mean that's what the Rams the Raiders the	3814	B
uh uh that's just	3814	B
yeah um going Super Bowl party actually so um	3814	B
i'll be out there for do it every year how about_1 y'all	3814	B
right	3814	B
and there you go	3814	B
yeah i- i just wish it would start a little bit earlier because i guess well out there it starts at four but starts at six here you know that's	3814	B
i don't i mean people you know that they're wondering why their ratings go down every year it's because_1 people get don't like to	3814	B
yeah i mean but- a time because_1 lot of people you know they got to work the next day they don't wanna be sitting around at nine or ten at night and	3814	B
you know they start taking off but	3814	B
yeah it's six- it's six o'clock here like six eighteen so it'll be	3814	B
but it's one good thing about living out there daylight everything	3814	B
but um	3814	B
well i guess that ought to do it	3814	B
okay yeah all right thank you later bye	3814	B
i'm fine i want to know where you're from	3835	B
oh are you	3835	B
i i am too	3835	B
are you at the Christ United	3835	B
are you in Christ United Methodist	3835	B
oh okay	3835	B
well okay well um anyway um i'm with a a choir and and we've been doing this as a fund raiser i wasn't sure if they were still doing it or not but i know that's not what we're supposed to talk about	3835	B
okay i'm having dinner right now and and on the subject of food so just continue and you tell me something you'd like to tell me about food	3835	B
uh no i'm not actually i wish i were	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
oh that's going to be easy	3835	B
oh well i guess my my favorite recipe that i've seen this week was fried green tomatoes did you see that in the paper	3835	B
right right	3835	B
well you know i don't guess i have i mean i'm from Mississippi originally and surely you know i don't even know that i've ever seen it offered to tell you the truth and but this- this evidently is a Southern delicacy that i didn't know about	3835	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3835	B
right	3835	B
well i tell you if you see that movie it'll make you want them_1	3835	B
oh yeah it just they just really make it look good now i love things like fried okra	3835	B
and i try not to ever have fried things but still you know if i i think uh that the fried green tomatoes would be something like that	3835	B
probably you probably bread them and and uh you know like with corn meal and that kind of thing and then	3835	B
fry them_1 in grease	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
ooh nice	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
oh	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
oh i bet that was good i know i would like that	3835	B
do you work um in any particular what particular- what area do you work in	3835	B
at Spring Creek in what what area	3835	B
manufacturing because my husband is works for TI also	3835	B
uh-huh he's at he's at Spring Creek but he's manager of	3835	B
<b_aside> what are you manager of honey <e_aside>	3835	B
telecommunications	3835	B
uh-huh always it it's so funny you know his job is so complicated that i	3835	B
to me it's complicated that i never can exactly describe this to anybody	3835	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
well um now back to Fried Green Tomatoes you be sure and see that movie	3835	B
we saw it last Saturday and it was wonderful	3835	B
oh it really was	3835	B
uh-huh well it's either one	3835	B
yeah uh-huh it it has it's a story that would appeal to both men and women uh Dave liked it a lot huh	3835	B
oh no now but my husband liked Steel Magnolias but it was more like this is more like Driving Miss Daisy did you see that and um and this probably is even a little more	3835	B
masculine than than Driving Miss Daisy even but it's that kind of movie that has just a universal appeal	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
well how you doing	3835	A
um i from um Plano Texas where how about you	3835	A
oh okay	3835	A
pardon	3835	A
no um i i work for TI	3835	A
so that's how	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
well are you are you having a Super Bowl party	3835	A
well i was thinking now that would be a good place to exchange a recipe maybe um	3835	A
no i didn't uh uh it's probably in reference to the movie i'm sure	3835	A
um i know my husband has heard about that and thought that that sounded really good are they i don't even i've never had fried tomatoes	3835	A
huh	3835	A
i didn't know about it either now we i have had um marinated green tomatoes you know where you marinate them with onions and cucumbers but i don't i've never had fried	3835	A
fried green ones	3835	A
oh really	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
are they pretty does it look like it's a pretty easy thing to make	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
now i did i did go to a dinner this past weekend that was um	3835	A
at our church we had a church auction last fall and a lot of the things that were auctioned off were um services like a dinner for eight and then if you bought if you bought it	3835	A
there were two couples that two or three couples that might cater the dinner	3835	A
and one couple in our church had lived in the Philippines um years oh eight years ago and so they um auctioned off a Filipino dinner	3835	A
and um so it was really fun one of the things that we had were was fried um bananas but but not fried bananas i don't know what they're called but it's a it's kind of looks like	3835	A
the dough that they use for egg rolls	3835	A
i don't know what it's called but	3835	A
they put bananas in there and with cinnamon and i don't know what else and sugar and stuff and then they deep fry it	3835	A
and they use green bananas you know so that the bananas kind of stay together and i have fixed fried bananas before	3835	A
as a um Cuban or Spanish dish	3835	A
you know and they're really really good	3835	A
but um when you were talking about fried tomatoes it reminded me of this the fried bananas that	3835	A
you know	3835	A
yeah it was really a fun a fun thing to do a fun way to raise money	3835	A
i'm up at Spring Creek	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
um manufacturing	3835	A
oh really huh	3835	A
okay okay so he's in a different group	3835	A
yeah yeah i never can either i i mean i never can describe mine to my family or anything try to um i try to talk real real basic level when i get down to them	3835	A
okay	3835	A
was it	3835	A
is it a girl movie i mean is it is it something my husband would enjoy	3835	A
because he doesn't like going to see girly movies like like um Steel Magnolias he didn't want you know	3835	A
yeah yeah yeah	3835	A
okay	3835	A
yeah i mean like i have to rent Beaches and you know some of those other movies	3835	A
go ahead	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
do you have profit sharing	3851	A
right	3851	A
well that's nice	3851	A
yeah my company has that too	3851	A
uh medical	3851	A
i work for a private laboratory	3851	A
yeah we were smaller and it it was it was a lot better the benefits were a lot better and then we bought out another lab and	3851	A
uh they kind of cut the benefits a little bit	3851	A
right	3851	A
right	3851	A
well that's not bad	3851	A
how	3851	A
oh really lowered it to what	3851	A
yeah	3851	A
to what's your deductible	3851	A
that's that's good	3851	A
right that's that's that's better than most though	3851	A
i	3851	A
right	3851	A
well that can help a company a lot you know if they if they're in the in the past have been giving a lot of benefits if they cut them just a little bit that'll help	3851	A
and then i think some employees will tolerate that instead of lowering their salaries	3851	A
yeah i would	3851	A
yeah i know they uh they raised our deductible from two hundred to four hundred	3851	A
a person	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
yeah it is but that's something i can live with you know if that's if that's what they want to stop at	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
right	3851	A
oh wow	3851	A
right	3851	A
no huh-uh we sure don't	3851	A
well they're they're pretty big around here too	3851	A
and you know the larger companies have the HMOs	3851	A
whereas the smaller companies don't	3851	A
i know our our company underwrites our own insurance	3851	A
which in a way i think it it could be a little bad but	3851	A
so far it's working out okay	3851	A
what H HMO are you with	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
oh that's not bad	3851	A
and you have a retirement program and all that	3851	A
a retirement program and all that	3851	A
right	3851	A
yeah i've heard of that 401K used as a retirement program before	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
right	3851	A
can you contribute to that 401K	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
all right well i as i say i work for a telecommunications company in Plano	3851	B
and uh i really can't complain about the benefits i think they're they're pretty up-to-date and pretty comprehensive uh	3851	B
uh yes they have a thrift plan and profit sharing and uh the the routine things the medical coverage and dental and	3851	B
uh hearing coverage and so forth	3851	B
stock purchase plan and that sort of thing	3851	B
yeah it's uh they're pretty good uh pretty good program pretty good benefits	3851	B
and uh	3851	B
there's a uh in the thrift plan you can make a choice of a program that you can have your contributions directed to it's not just uh for the purchase of the company's stock it	3851	B
they have three or four different options available for you so it's uh and the vacation	3851	B
what kind of what industry you in	3851	B
oh i see	3851	B
oh okay	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
um	3851	B
um there's a lot of that going on because of the economy and so forth the medical programs have been cut back and	3851	B
we've had to uh i guess up to a year ago the coverage for the employee medical coverage was free but they they charge i think five dollars a month now and they they've	3851	B
no it's you can't complain about that and they've raised deductible or lowered lowered the deductible	3851	B
wait a minute now they raised the deductible they raised the deductible	3851	B
i think it's uh oh it's two hundred per person five hundred for for the family two hundred per covered	3851	B
uh it's it's been better but they have as i said they've raised it here in the last year or two	3851	B
but again i can't i really can't complain about that the vacation plan is pretty good	3851	B
uh there are eleven holidays a year it's it's again it's a competitive program pretty standard	3851	B
yeah well as i said and as you know they're they're cutting back in a lot of areas and uh	3851	B
not just laying off but uh cutting salaries and cutting back in the benefits area as well so	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
oh yeah that's for sure	3851	B
or being laid off but	3851	B
um per	3851	B
for the for the employee	3851	B
yeah that's pretty steep	3851	B
they have a flexible spending account up here where you can contribute a certain amount every month to this flexible spending plan- spending plan and use that money to uh pay your medical uh costs out of	3851	B
and there's there's a lot of interest in that of course if you put in too much money you have to have a pretty good idea as to what your medical expenses are going to be for the year	3851	B
because if you put in too much and you you don't use it all you don't get it back	3851	B
you lose it but uh there's quite a bit of interest in that	3851	B
we have an HMO as well as the uh standard group program	3851	B
do you have an HMO down at your place	3851	B
yeah i don't think there's as much interest in that up here in the HMO as the regular	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
right	3851	B
oh okay	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
well	3851	B
oh it's uh	3851	B
it's Cigna i think we uh	3851	B
Cigna is the uh one that they're using	3851	B
and we have Aetna Aetna underwrites- underwrites not underwrites but it Aetna administers our medical program we're self-insured but Aetna is used to administer the program but Cigna Cigna is the uh HMO they use	3851	B
no it's it's pretty good it's pretty good coverage	3851	B
a what	3851	B
oh	3851	B
well it's uh no they don't they really they don't have- that's one thing they don't have- i guess i could say they really do need to uh	3851	B
uh get or acquire they they think that the 401K could be used as a as a retirement plan i guess that's what some people are doing	3851	B
but there's no retirement plan at all	3851	B
in fact they're using a company down there in Austin 401K management company to administer the program- it switched to them over the well last month	3851	B
but uh they made a nice presentation so the company decided to go with them but that's one thing they could use as a retirement plan unless you do unless you are committed to using your 401K as a as a retirement program	3851	B
but they don't have any kind of retirement plan	3851	B
oh yes yeah and they do too they match it up to a certain percent you can contribute up to fifteen percent depending on your salary	3851	B
and then uh	3851	B
tell me what's the last movie you saw	3880	A
Hook	3880	A
oh yeah there seems to be a lot out especially around Christmas but we were	3880	A
kind of busy and didn't really get out to see any of them_1	3880	A
uh the last one i went to the theater to see was uh The Doctors	3880	A
and i thought that was real good	3880	A
but i rent movies all the time	3880	A
yeah the last- the one that that seems to be the way we do it any more i saw Dying Young over the weekend	3880	A
and last week	3880	A
uh what's her name Julia Roberts	3880	A
and uh it was just really good	3880	A
i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying	3880	A
but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it	3880	A
yeah trying to	3880	A
i have been putting off to go see that one but my wife wants to see it too	3880	A
it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
oh yeah i	3880	A
yeah i went uh i went to the theater to see that one and then i rented it i think when it came out too	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
sometimes you're right it doesn't uh	3880	A
but it beats watching what ever is on television	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
we had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the Godfather movies	3880	A
so we did that	3880	A
and	3880	A
it was uh you know like fourteen hours of Godfather stuff	3880	A
no it took us about three days but	3880	A
yeah well it was still lots i'm telling you when that that the last hour you know number three	3880	A
we felt like we were Italians we were eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop	3880	A
there's three	3880	A
yeah it's almost something around fourteen hours	3880	A
uh but my- i think my favorite though are old movies black and white	3880	A
uh	3880	A
i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that	3880	A
it's just i don't know there's just something about them_1 i think it reminds me of my childhood	3880	A
not i just remember you know when i was little in the summer we got to stay up all night and that's what was on	3880	A
so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
i watched uh Doris Day Retrospective on uh CBS the other night just	3880	A
i thing about her and different movies she'd been in and i realized how much i missed the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies	3880	A
they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater	3880	A
and because they were like fantasy and and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere i'll want to watch it so	3880	A
yeah i am still here yes	3880	A
yeah i was just kind of	3880	A
i am in a rest area and i was just kind of looking somebody went by there i	3880	A
yeah uh to Tennessee it's my mother's eighty fifth birthday	3880	A
uh Kingsport	3880	A
you know where that is	3880	A
oh yeah are they still there	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
yeah i remember back when they first open in the early seventies there i worked at Univac and uh just down the road and boy all the everybody just	3880	A
the last movie i saw in a theater was Hook	3880	B
and uh it was very enjoyable um	3880	B
i'm trying to think there's a lot of movies i want to see	3880	B
but it but what the last one you saw	3880	B
hum	3880	B
yeah we do too	3880	B
is that good that's with um i'm trying to think who's in that	3880	B
oh okay okay	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
um we want to go see JFK	3880	B
i mean i've heard lots of reviews and stuff but i still want to see it just to	3880	B
and uh	3880	B
yeah it is and Plano has grown so much that	3880	B
um you know the restaurants and stuff are all so crowded now you use to be able to get out to get a quick bit to eat and go see a movie and it's just not that way any more	3880	B
so we usually stay in on Friday nights and rent movies and i think probably the last rented movie i saw	3880	B
well no i take that back it wasn't rented i think it was just on HBO at my in-laws house or something but it was Hunt for Red October	3880	B
and i love that movie	3880	B
yeah oh that would've been a good one	3880	B
that would've been a good one to see	3880	B
yeah but renting them_1 just doesn't do them_1 justice sometimes	3880	B
yeah that's true i mean i think like uh Dances with Wolves just	3880	B
you know would be a good movie on television but it you know the scenery and everything was so beautiful on the screen	3880	B
oh really	3880	B
all of them did you	3880	B
oh wow in one night	3880	B
okay i was going to say that's a long movie	3880	B
how many are there	3880	B
three okay	3880	B
well that's not as bad as as uh Friday the 13th or Planet of the Apes or	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
really	3880	B
um-hum um-hum	3880	B
we went through a stage where we rented a lot of the um Alfred Hitchcock	3880	B
the you know the like North by Northwest and Rear Window and all those and those are really good i mean you know the old black and whites and	3880	B
yeah oh yeah	3880	B
hum	3880	B
um-hum	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
oh they're those are some movies	3880	B
and they come on uh every now and then	3880	B
are you still there	3880	B
okay it got real quiet i didn't know	3880	B
there was no static or anything i thought no	3880	B
i thought i'd lost you	3880	B
so you are headed up to Tennessee	3880	B
where about	3880	B
oh okay that's right yeah um i work for TI and i've traveled up to Johnson City before and i	3880	B
um most of it was sold off to Simon's but there is still about five hundred employees that work that are TI	3880	B
oh	3880	B
well have you taken any vacations that you enjoyed lately	3837	A
okay so you went up like the Coast Highway for a way and then then went inland there	3837	A
is is that uh was that a new area for you to visit	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
it's the	3837	A
it's scenic i guess i i've i've been to a part of that on a trip to San Francisco i i went up just a short ways up the coast to i believe it was Point Raid	3837	A
uh National Seashore i think it was	3837	A
and and i only had about a day so it was just a short drive up from San Francisco and back when i was out out for business	3837	A
uh the the Redwood forest there	3837	A
what part of the country are you from	3837	A
are you currently living in Texas	3837	A
okay i- i'm in Texas too but	3837	A
in Richardson	3837	A
that's right	3837	A
well we uh my family and i moved here about three years ago we lived in Colorado and	3837	A
uh and and that's a good vacation spot too but it was nice living there	3837	A
yes i i didn't live too far from there in fact i bicycled from my house to there a time or two uh	3837	A
uh from Boulder i lived in Boulder Colorado	3837	A
uh i i uh didn't probably take advantage of it as much as i probably would if i moved back you kind of take it for granted when you live there but	3837	A
i did enjoy the skiing and and the and the winter sports that that was available there	3837	A
yeah it's enjoyable if you if you do it more than once or twice so you get past the learning stage so you can start enjoying it it's a little bit frustrating when you're falling a lot but after after you get past that it's a lot of fun	3837	A
well it sometimes can be yeah it it uh	3837	A
you can get some nice days skiing as well though if you're if you're not falling you can stay pretty dry and	3837	A
and uh it it can be pretty nice the dry climate doesn't feel near as cold as as it does here in the winter time to me	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
it's the the other extreme	3837	A
yeah it's i i agree with you it's sort of in between yeah after having lived in Colorado a lot that was a little dryer than was probably comfortable it's it's a bit little too dry and	3837	A
and this is actually a pretty good climate humidity wise in in the Dallas area	3837	A
last uh uh summer we uh we went uh and took the family to uh Cancun in Mexico and uh we really enjoyed that trip	3837	A
well it's pretty built up now	3837	A
yeah it probably was more enjoyable when you went before it was too too built it's it's a real strip hotel strip now out out on that island	3837	A
uh yes we we took a sailboat uh catamaran ride over to Isle Mujeres and they took us around let us shop a little while and then took us to some snorkeling uh	3837	A
spot	3837	A
yes took one in October and uh drove- uh flew into Los Angeles and drove up the coast	3837	B
to uh through Monterey and San Francisco and over to Lake Tahoe and flew out of Reno	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
uh-huh was really great	3837	B
most of it was because_1 i had uh seen parts of northern California and i'd been to San Francisco but never along the Coast Road	3837	B
it was quite exciting	3837	B
my husband said he didn't know whether he wanted to ever drive it again though	3837	B
have you been	3837	B
um i don't remember that	3837	B
oh	3837	B
well we went uh we liked Monterey very much and uh it was just kind of a relaxed pleasant town with a lot of things to see and do and	3837	B
and then uh the Muir Woods on the other side of San Francisco um that's another really bad drive but it's it's worth going to too	3837	B
yes	3837	B
originally from Texas i was raised up in Dalhart	3837	B
so uh anything that doesn't look like flat plains is uh like i told someone once i always thought Dallas was real green	3837	B
because it was the greenest place i'd ever been	3837	B
oh yes live in Dallas	3837	B
where are you from- where do you live	3837	B
okay well you're just a a suburb of Dallas	3837	B
oh	3837	B
oh my	3837	B
yes yes	3837	B
well we uh when our children were young we used to go to Estes Park	3837	B
oh	3837	B
well how fortunate you were	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
that's that is one beautiful place	3837	B
no	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
um	3837	B
well i've never skied my husband keeps saying we need to go but uh we have never done it yet but uh everyone who does says it's great	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
you have to enjoy the cold snow in your face huh	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
well i think that uh no the dampness course our humidity is sort of medium compared uh well where i was raised is extremely dry	3837	B
but my brother lives in Houston and	3837	B
yeah so we're kind of in-between but uh my mother always said that Dallas was extremely humid to her	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
have you gone on any vacations lately	3837	B
oh yeah	3837	B
have they uh uh we were we were there when it one of the first times it was open they were just building the hotels and	3837	B
i was afraid it had become so commercialized	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
did you go over to the Isle Mujeres	3837	B
um	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
oh did you get to go out to that reef	3837	B
yes sir	3839	A
well uh you mean that i did or had done	3839	A
either one well actually um this whole past summer i've had my old outside of my house repainted	3839	A
and a lot of the little minor wood things corrected	3839	A
and just prior to that i had a a bathroom totally remodeled and rebuilt and uh so i've i'm bringing my house up-to-date really	3839	A
we built the house in nineteen sixty	3839	A
no	3839	A
that's right they they- they do change and and the bathrooms you know if you have any water leakage anywhere can uh slowly deteriorate things and so you got to plug those leaks up	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
is that right well- is the water level high there	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
oh well we just got about a an inch inch and a half last night	3839	A
oh i see	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
oh i see are you doing this yourself	3839	A
i declare oh well	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
uh-huh	3839	A
that's true these lot of fellows uh uh really- really want to work pretty hard so they willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices i'm sure of that i just had some guttering also replaced on my home	3839	A
uh i actually replaced all the other guttering last year and and the piece that i did this year seemed all right at the time so i left it alone	3839	A
that's what i put up this last time it's one solid piece about thirty feet long	3839	A
no it was uh brought out on a truck	3839	A
so i i- it was it- i have seen these things done they uh they come on great big large wheels i think of material and they roll it off	3839	A
yeah	3839	A
well this as i say this was already uh they had come out and measured it and brought out the two pieces at the correct length and all they had to do is mount them and then uh seal one joint where the two ends came together	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
uh-huh	3839	A
worked all right huh	3839	A
that's very very close i	3839	A
as they say down south you done good	3839	A
yeah	3839	A
well that sounds great	3839	A
yeah well i've got this uh the we were talking earlier about my house i've got one more bathroom to rebuild and uh	3839	A
we also have a a a porch that extends out from our master bedroom that we want to rebuild it's uh taken a beating over the years and um now we're a little afraid to walk out on it because some of the wood is deteriorating	3839	A
uh we're in between the mountains we're we're in uh what we're called Nitny Valley at Penn State i	3839	A
hey Larry what is the last home repair job you did	3839	B
had the either one	3839	B
um-hum you-	3839	B
how old is your house	3839	B
well that's not that old of a house but things do change from time to time don't they	3839	B
y'all have basements in Pennsylvania don't you	3839	B
we don't have basements in Texas unless it's an unusual- a very unusual situation	3839	B
uh no we build them_1 on pier and beams as they- up for few years back and then what's popular now is just called a slab	3839	B
and we don't have snow to speak of	3839	B
if it snows in Dallas we won't- we don't go to work and wait for it to melt and at lunch we have the day off you know it i'm serious we just we don't have any snow plows	3839	B
uh the last home project i guess well a year and a half ago we bought a house that had laid vacant for about two years and had been	3839	B
well sad situation estate thing and we've kind of put the whole thing back together uh the biggest thing i did was uh refenced and redecked in the back	3839	B
are you kidding	3839	B
i'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a hammer and a nail it wouldn't be straight anyway	3839	B
uh	3839	B
let's see and we- we found a part time fireman and policeman and in their so- so called spare time they moonlight	3839	B
and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow page advertised uh	3839	B
personnel	3839	B
um-hum	3839	B
have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now	3839	B
no kidding	3839	B
were you were you happy- did they make it right there on your property	3839	B
oh okay	3839	B
i haven't seen it done when we moved into the uh the house we	3839	B
we got guttering bids we finally repaired briefly what we've got for less than a hundred bucks those guys were gonna sell me a three thousand	3839	B
go ahead and uh they talked about bringing a machine out and just making it right there in the front yard and putting it up as they make it so i've never seen one	3839	B
i just thought of a project i did my wife wanted an island in the kitchen	3839	B
well we the house isn't that new so i built a uh	3839	B
a uh	3839	B
a table	3839	B
from the local hardware store we have a outfit called Home Depot which is probably local down here but i ordered a Formica top with rounded corners	3839	B
and then they have premade and bevelled uh legs and braces and so i simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces and and uh put it together and uh	3839	B
for and it worked just fine it was premeasured- the legs were premeasured exactly the same length so it's level hold it i have to put two business cards underneath it that's pretty damn close for an amateur	3839	B
uh	3839	B
yeah had somebody come through and he said my gosh if you had bought that at a store it'd been seven hundred and fifty dollars and i got out for about a hundred and forty five i think	3839	B
so i was happy	3839	B
um-hum	3839	B
how nice	3839	B
are y'all in the mountains	3839	B
yes sir	3898	B
well there is two kinds one i guess i'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh	3898	B
oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant uh you know something nice	3898	B
and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy	3898	B
uh recently we've been hitting Pancho's up it's a local Mexican restaurant pretty heavily because they've got a good rate on the you know good prices and everything	3898	B
yeah yeah it's it's a chain down here- uh it goes up into Colorado and down here i don't know where else it is what about you	3898	B
oh yeah	3898	B
i think think it might be i've seen- i think i've seen it around yes sir yeah	3898	B
oh do you yeah	3898	B
oh we we do too we uh we enjoy Mexican food i'm just not impressed with the quality of it it's just primarily the price that's uh	3898	B
satisfying at this point but the kids seem to enjoy it um	3898	B
and uh let's see we've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here but it's uh	3898	B
not part of a chain it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant but the first one we've been to that	3898	B
uh i don't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had that was uh not just really super it's nice to find a place like that	3898	B
you know yeah	3898	B
um	3898	B
oh boy have you ever been to uh what is it Original Book Binders in Philadelphia	3898	B
uh that's an old established uh restaurant i used to go there when i was in college	3898	B
i went to the Naval Academy and we used to we used to go up there on uh for football games sometimes	3898	B
and have some liberty and yeah we'd go over there to uh pretty sure it was original Original Book Binders i think it was yes	3898	B
i haven't been back there in years	3898	B
okay what area	3898	B
is that right did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando Florida	3898	B
yes sir my dad worked there for years and years that's where- that's uh that's where i grew up was down in Orlando so	3898	B
that's uh that's interesting well i was in submarines uh	3898	B
okay yeah must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there when- when did you retire	3898	B
well great i'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics	3898	B
yeah	3898	B
okay right first	3898	B
oh we we do enjoy that yes sir uh i don't know if we're particularly adventurous we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh	3898	B
at a particular restaurant and then we usually stick by it but do you what about you	3898	B
hot um-hum	3898	B
um where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking	3898	B
um-hum	3898	B
uh-huh what's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food	3898	B
i guess one of the things we've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that but we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh seafood- you know even uh shrimp uh	3898	B
dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant	3898	B
okay thanks for that uh reference	3898	B
-okay good yeah	3898	B
okay Gene so it's nice to talk with you and um food is a very intriguing thing our lives are are built around foods that we like and and nutritionally good for us what kind of dining out do you like	3898	A
oh	3898	A
yeah	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
Pancho that's a new one um-hum	3898	A

and uh we had a restaurant called La Bamba but it's just it closed recently but Chi-Chi's is a national restaurant i think isn't it Mexican do you have it there	3898	A
uh-huh well i love Mexican food myself	3898	A
but you go ahead now	3898	A
is that right	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
oh boy that is wonderful well i- i agree with you on that and i was- was really a seafood addict myself i- i love crab meat in particular	3898	A
i uh i can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if had to	3898	A
i know the name but i haven't been there	3898	A
uh-huh where did you go to college	3898	A
oh the Naval Academy	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
i'll be darn	3898	A
well we're we're supposed to be talking about dining out but i'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from Penn State	3898	A
and uh all my work has been in research for the Navy	3898	A
underwater acoustics	3898	A
i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has	3898	A
um-hum	3898	A
oh you grew up in Orlando uh-huh	3898	A
well that's what i worked on	3898	A
uh end of last month	3898	A
i certainly have	3898	A
so what- i hate to uh i wish i could talk to you about that uh but uh i guess we should continue on uh	3898	A
okay how do you like Chinese food	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
well i uh enjoy the Szechuan type of uh Chinese food	3898	A
yes yep um it's it's i i do a lot of Chinese cooking myself i have in the past i haven't done it recently but uh it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like that are just really delicious meals	3898	A
um just at home	3898	A
i- i enjoyed the food and i bought a lot of uh	3898	A
good cookbooks and i've been following through on that when you find the right cookbook why it works out	3898	A
okay well that one's a good question here it's right under my nose if i can find it	3898	A
oh boy	3898	A
yeah right	3898	A
one of the the this book i have is called Chinese Cooking Made Easy	3898	A
um	3898	A
it's a paperback and i think it's by someone named Chang yeah Isabelle Chang	3898	A

yeah great have you done much uh much in the way of home repairs	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
great how old a house do you have	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah yeah great	3829	A
oh well right now we're not we're living in a travel trailer but uh we've we we've just moved here to Dallas uh recently and we're living in that until we can find a place but	3829	A
uh we lived in a brick homes in uh in Louisiana before this and did some uh various kinds of things uh made some storm windows to put up and	3829	A
uh	3829	A
uh really did a major {rejob} on the inside of the house uh put up some walls and uh put in a bathroom and stuff like that	3829	A
uh	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
wow that's pretty good yeah	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
um-hum do you think it was worth uh the ceiling fans on your resale	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
sure well sounds good you think you'll do it again some time	3829	A
hum	3829	A
is that right yeah	3829	A
oh it sounds like you've got a good bit of experience in that	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
sure we're thinking about possibly building a house now we aren't real sure whether we're gonna be able to do that or not but we just talked to a builder today as a matter of fact	3829	A
you know just uh beginning to think about sketching out some plans and talked about some of the different uh	3829	A
ways to go on you know different things	3829	A
yeah it sounds like you're uh really into uh remodeling what you get	3829	A
yeah	3829	A
okay	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
um-hum how far away from Austin is it	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
ever are you um	3829	A
looking to get	3829	A
uh well since Christmas we painted a bedroom and did some wallpapering in there i had to do most of it since uh my wife was working	3829	B
uh Austin yeah and getting- getting ready around here to do some uh major yard work as soon as the weather turns a little bit nicer	3829	B
yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but i figure i'd just be wasting my time	3829	B
uh i've always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that except maybe i don't do heaters and air conditioners but	3829	B
i usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and things	3829	B
uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh it's kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it we've only we only moved here about a year ago	3829	B
what about you what kind of house you live in	3829	B
about two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville which is like forty miles east of Austin over toward Houston uh little old stucco house built in nineteen twenty one and uh	3829	B
we bought it to- for- to get- for a weekend getaway	3829	B
and it needed a lot of work but we saw it when we first looked at it we can do this and uh sure enough uh it's oh nineteen months later we sold it for twenty six and we bought it for sixteen five	3829	B
and we did things like paint uh inside and outside and basically repaired the garages we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my part but	3829	B
it was something i thought the place needed because_1 it had real high ceilings and uh just and just in general did everything we uh put in a hot water heater a new toilet and things like that kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets	3829	B
well we weren't think- talking about reselling it when we started doing it we were looking for something to do on weekends	3829	B
and it because_1 my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment and if it doesn't work try another color things like that	3829	B
so but when the offer came to us it was from a neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them_1 and we thought well you know we're not we hadn't been out here but what once in three months and	3829	B
and we had just bought this house in Austin so we thought well what the heck let's make a little money on it	3829	B
yeah i'd like to uh	3829	B
we have bought new homes in the past and and we'll never do that again because it was just boring for- after about a week	3829	B
yeah so	3829	B
uh out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down oh terribly run down home and uh it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make almost forty five thousand in profit on it	3829	B
and that was just	3829	B
yeah uh it's just we you know we map out what we want to do and we go for it uh	3829	B
whoever's got time to do it and course you get the major things done like your you know have the floors redone or have carpet put in whatever but the rest of it we usually do ourselves	3829	B
yeah i uh i think about that from time to time because_1 we've never actually you know built one that we wanted you know the way we wanted it and things like that but	3829	B
i'm not sure that our interest is that piqued in it to do something like that	3829	B
yeah renovation- renovation is kind of where we're at like our our favorite TV program is This Old House has been for many years	3829	B
and we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it uh	3829	B
there again we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home and because they're so it's a town that time has passed by so there are a lot of old big homes and they're fairly inexpensive	3829	B
so	3829	B
it's forty miles uh it's on the it's on the river and it's a quite nice little town they've been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things i mean there's no KMarts or anything like that around so	3829	B
makes it kind of nice	3829	B
so what are your favorite shows	3850	B
oh really	3850	B
Quantum Leap	3850	B
did you see it the other night-	3850	B
that was a that was pretty good	3850	B
when he with the psychic and everything	3850	B
okay	3850	B
yeah i like uh	3850	B
i like	3850	B
Northern Exposure and uh Home Improvement	3850	B
you've never seen Northern Exposure	3850	B
oh it's a great show	3850	B
really yeah we like it too	3850	B
have you seen the movie	3850	B
oh you haven't seen any of them_1	3850	B
oh well they're good	3850	B
they're real good	3850	B
they're uh	3850	B
they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though	3850	B
which ones are you watching the new ones	3850	B
oh okay	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
well they're	3850	B
they're a lot different but i like i like the older ones because_1 at that time you know they were really	3850	B
futuristic you know	3850	B
and	3850	B
the newer ones are	3850	B
i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too but i like i like both of them_1	3850	B
really	3850	B
no it's	3850	B
not really	3850	B
it's not really like a soap opera but	3850	B
but it's	3850	B
but that's true i mean you you learn more about the the characters and stuff but that's the way all shows are now	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
well the it seems they always show Colombo the same ones over and over though	3850	B
you know what i'm saying like that one where he goes to college	3850	B
or those is there a series on	3850	B
okay	3850	B
yeah i saw that one see that was a rerun	3850	B
yeah i'm wondering if that's	3850	B
see i don't know if that's the the	3850	B
movie of the week or	3850	B
or what but it seems like there's only about	3850	B
four or five different ones and then and they keep showing them_1 over and over	3850	B
he was a movie director and he had that gal killed	3850	B
okay	3850	B
that was pretty good though	3850	B
um-hum	3850	B
no kidding	3850	B
what is it that there's something i watch	3850	B
something i watch on Saturdays and i can't remember what it is	3850	B
now i used to watch Twin Peaks	3850	B
you never saw that	3850	B
yeah yeah that was a definite soap opera	3850	B
but it was it was a different type of show	3850	B
i didn't like the way it ended though	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
yeah they didn't they only did it for i think two years	3850	B
but it's all over now	3850	B
okay_1	3850	A
um i like watching Colombo and um Matlock and	3850	A
Quantum Leap yeah	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
um uh-huh	3850	A
yeah that one was what is that	3850	A
uh-huh yeah	3850	A
oh i well i haven't seen either of those	3850	A
huh-uh	3850	A
um	3850	A
i also like to watch Star Trek but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it	3850	A
uh i haven't seen any of the movies because_1 i just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it and they're you know already out with number six by now but	3850	A
so i haven't seen any of the movies yet but i	3850	A
no	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
yeah i've seen uh quite a few of the older ones i haven't seen really the new generation that much	3850	A
is there one you prefer better the older one or the younger- the newer one	3850	A
oh yeah	3850	A
yeah i do too i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones	3850	A
a lot i mean he almost hates the new ones yeah because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but	3850	A
whatever	3850	A
oh i think yeah	3850	A
yeah sure	3850	A
well let's see	3850	A
um	3850	A
i like to watch Colombo because it's like a mystery thing	3850	A
and that's sort of how Matlock is but Colombo is	3850	A
uh did you see the one	3850	A
um did-	3850	A
um yeah there's like one on well we see it Thursdays at seven	3850	A
and	3850	A
it was this last time it was about this um movie director	3850	A
did you happen- did you see that one	3850	A
really oh i guess i've never-	3850	A
huh	3850	A
oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before	3850	A
yeah	3850	A
yeah on the set or something	3850	A
yeah it was	3850	A
but i yeah i like Colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things	3850	A
but um there's no never anything good on Saturdays though	3850	A
i don't think so well Star Trek's on at five but i'm never home	3850	A
so	3850	A
oh	3850	A
i've heard of it a lot i've heard of a lot of	3850	A
people somehow or something they'll say so and so from Twin Peaks or something you know	3850	A
oh	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
oh did they end the whole series	3850	A
oh	3850	A
oh	3850	A
oh another show i like to watch is MASH	3850	A
uh it was about the Vietnam right	3879	A
yeah well uh	3879	A
guess uh i'm twenty three are you older than i am	3879	A
so you probably have a better -opinion of of what	3879	A
huh	3879	A
right	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
um	3879	A
yeah	3879	A
yeah i mean looking back now know what we know now i mean it was just a complete disaster	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
yeah i just think	3879	A
that the Gulf War was just something that was really	3879	A
um	3879	A
i know it's i kind of look at it as a little bit of propaganda in a way because i mean we- basically- went in and spent i don't know how many billions of dollars and	3879	A
just beat up on a	3879	A
inferior yeah inferior army that was just wanting- wanting to quit and didn't have any food and i mean it's just i don't know how much pride one can really take in that and	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
oh yeah that's just um	3879	A
i've seen uh you know Apocalypse Now and um	3879	A
uh what was the one with um Christopher Waken and um	3879	A
The Deer Hunter yeah i've you know and the just a lot of other i guess inferior ones made but i mean as far i think Apocalypse Now and um Deer Hunter were just	3879	A
just incredible movies you know Deer Hunter's a little bit more of a incident but	3879	A
yeah Heart of Darkness yeah i've seen that that was uh it's great they had it on Showtime um before they released it to theaters fact	3879	A
around the summer and uh it's really something it's almost it it's just as entertaining if not more entertaining than a film is because_1 it's	3879	A
right she just shot documentary you know had like a little hand held camera and you know the whole thing's been edited together but when Martin Sheen had his heart attack it's just amazing what you know Frances is just	3879	A
it it doesn't capture the actual event it captures him getting uh some treatment after it happened but she had a tape reporter running when he was talking on the phone about it and	3879	A
he's just literally freaking out i mean about he's more concerned about the you know how because_1 he's as the whole time i guess when it was being made um i was just a kid back then but i guess it's just	3879	A
the people back in America just were hearing about it how it was just such a disaster this is like the last thing he need is is for Marty to have a heart attack i mean you'll you'll love it i mean it's it's really great um	3879	A
the Vietnam War	3879	B
yeah i'm forty one so i would uh	3879	B
well i uh was in college when the war escalated to it's height and uh	3879	B
i guess my feeling is consistent with that of uh the general public that it was unfortunate	3879	B
event uh	3879	B
it's real interesting to think about it in the context of this new movie JFK which is	3879	B
apparently linking the Kennedy assassination to his decision to his- uh uh the apparently people uh who worked for Kennedy say he didn't decide that he was going to	3879	B
pull out of Vietnam was not going to commit more troops that that had nothing to do with the assassination of those people say but they that he had come to that conclusion	3879	B
i think it was uh	3879	B
particularly in light of recent events a really unfortunate mistake Communism was self destructing even then and uh	3879	B
the history of Vietnam which has been uh represented in a number of different commentaries and documentaries one on the public broadcasting system	3879	B
uh it seems that it just didn't have to happen and i think uh its a valuable	3879	B
uh if painful lesson for this country	3879	B
right	3879	B
at the time i wasn't that uh	3879	B
wasn't that sure i- i- i really didn't know enough about it and wasn't that politically active uh	3879	B
but it was	3879	B
um	3879	B
apparently something that could've been avoided and i you know i- i look at wars generally as falling into that category um	3879	B
people are beginning to wonder whether or not the uh the Gulf War could've been avoided even though that was a remarkably painless war and as wars go	3879	B
right	3879	B
third world country really	3879	B
well i think what what's uh i- i guess i'd use the word relevant to the Vietnam War question is that the Vietnam War was apparently avoidable too it was a time when Ho Chi Minh	3879	B
apparently came to the United States and said look if you're willing to provide me with support all i wanna do is unify Vietnam	3879	B
and uh he was turned away by Truman um	3879	B
so it's	3879	B
hum	3879	B
a painful lesson i guess one that we're beginning to learn i'm really impressed by how much effect some of these movies have had on public consciousness the JFK movie's cause causing one person after another to	3879	B
call for the release of the documents that have been sealed	3879	B
did you see any of the Vietnam Wars um any of the Vietnam war movies	3879	B
oh the Deer Hunter	3879	B
yeah	3879	B
those two yep	3879	B
yeah they were they've	3879	B
yeah well they were both remarkable films as a matter of fact there's a new film out about the Vietnam War about the making of Apocalypse Now which itself is suppose to be a great yeah have you is it good	3879	B
that's what people say i'm really looking forward to seeing his wife apparently made it from- documentary	3879	B
oh is is that on film did- that- that get captured on film	3879	B
right right right	3879	B
yeah well i the thing i think is really neat about	3879	B
well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i side- i lean more towards the control side than than towards	3803	B
you know just the the free free arming um on the other hand i it's it's sort of an issue of of uh	3803	B
uh i'm not i'm not a great fan of of government control in general and so it's it's kind of a tough issue what about yourself	3803	B
um-hum	3803	B
i'm i'm sure yeah um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um	3803	B
specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that is that	3803	B
huh	3803	B
yeah i i have i- i have the impression that that the	3803	B
the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are- are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway	3803	B
um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents' gun or something and and	3803	B
shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's that's certainly within the channels right	3803	B
but um	3803	B
a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns	3803	B
uh-huh	3803	B
yeah	3803	B
uh-huh yeah i i mean i think uh some states- or i i i don't know if anybody actually has implemented i think so um at least there's been talk about doing uh	3803	B
you know like waiting periods and and things like that um and and uh	3803	B
you know i i think stuff like that is perfectly good i mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything strange- you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes	3803	B
waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem you know and and things i don't know i've	3803	B
you know i uh i don't own a gun and and don't really want one and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did um but on the other hand you	3803	B
know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general uh	3803	B
yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they're not gonna disappear anytime soon um and they're already	3803	B
i know there's a ready market for them_1 you know in the stolen- the stolen stolen guns can be sold i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun	3803	B
right because uh because they they can be so easily sold	3803	B
and you know their their i don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but um it's not like they're gonna disappear all of a sudden	3803	B
um even if you do do a total ban on them_1	3803	B
uh-huh it's a real tough problem	3803	B
i i don't know i don't know where i	3803	B
really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue i think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing right	3803	B
you know and	3803	B
uh-huh	3803	B
hm	3803	B
yeah well we you know we i grew up with them_1 i never really took to hunting i mean i did some of it but uh	3803	B
you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that	3803	B
and you know it was a whole different thing and and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses	3803	B
but it you know that's that seems to me just to be a whole another issue um you know the the thing that the i yeah i'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people	3803	B
hi what do you think about gun control	3803	A
well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or	3803	A
um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in DC come home very quickly	3803	A
well i'm not so sure about that but i think somehow uh safety courses	3803	A
or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people	3803	A
i'd like to know that the people who had them_1 at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them_1 or not you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better	3803	A
which is sort of you know flaky but still	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
yeah i don't know this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns	3803	A
and went up to New York and sold them_1 for you know very high markups now in a sense that's a legal	3803	A
way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
right	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
right and i suppose complete- uh you know complete- total ban would lead to more illegal weapons	3803	A
um-hum um-hum	3803	A
right	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
but that's true i mean some people grew up with guns in the house we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing	3803	A
and i'm not sure that's good either	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
well i think they ought to spend- uh i don't think they ought to spend overly spend on it but uh i don't see anything wrong with you know having a pretty good budget for it because uh	3816	B
heck i don't know i don't i think maybe one day they will uh find a good use for it you know maybe they haven't all that much yet uh other than the little things they've developed in this space shuttle	3816	B
the little experiments that they've done and so forth you know	3816	B
in uh i know they asked the question uh would you go if you had the chance and i'd go tomorrow	3816	B
if i had a chance	3816	B
yeah right	3816	B
well i don't know i just it would be something i've never experienced before weightlessness i'd love to experience weightlessness that's something i've always uh thought would be fascinating you know	3816	B
yeah	3816	B
yeah i think so	3816	B
when they had the uh accident you know back- the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i won't go you know but uh since then i thought well what the heck i'd go if it would be a one time- once in lifetime experience i'd try it	3816	B
no i don't think so	3816	B
uh it might it it very well may uh i think it's sort a	3816	B
had a setback because of that accident and uh and sometimes i get really disappointed because they have so many delays when they have a launch	3816	B
and everything i think gee you know they'll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch	3816	B
so i don't know you know they seems like they sort of bog down they're not really progressing right now to me	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
yeah	3816	B
yeah well i believe that uh they'll eventually make it to Mars you know maybe not in our lifetime but uh you know if this world is still here at that time i think they'll i think they'll eventually do that	3816	B
right	3816	B
is that right i didn't realize that	3816	B
uh-huh	3816	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3816	B
sure sure	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
yeah well that's true that's true and i guess they've got a lot of uh they've done a lot of medical tests	3816	B
uh in space too and uh i mean- i don't know what they've they've actually come up with	3816	B
but uh i know that medicine is another	3816	B
area that they used- that they've used in space a lot you know	3816	B
that's right	3816	B
right right	3816	B
is that no i don't even know about that	3816	B
oh yeah the the the ice	3816	B
right	3816	B
uh-huh	3816	B
right- to the weightlessness yeah	3816	B
i think- i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of	3816	B
sort of sitting still but i think eventually it will uh they'll it will come to them	3816	B
you know	3816	B
that's right well you know talking about the weightlessness i've uh i've uh noticed that they've talked about like these Russian astronauts that stay up there for nearly a year	3816	B
you know they have a lot of problems with the i'm not sure what it is with the the muscle muscle- tone and so forth because_1 they uh	3816	B
they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but it's not the same as exercising with gravity and the i i'm not sure exactly	3816	B
what the deal was but there were some problems with long term weightlessness	3816	B
yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess	3816	B
i- i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i- i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when- when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they walk- they couldn't walk very well	3816	B
when they finally made it back into gravity and uh i'm not sure exactly why that was you know i mean it was because of the weightlessness but i'm not sure physiologically what happened	3816	B
ready so what do you think do we spend too much on the space program or	3816	A
do you	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah we could	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
oh you're an adventurer huh	3816	A
what makes it what makes it so exciting for you	3816	A
yeah that that'd be fun that'd be a lot of fun	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
that's true yeah i'd i'd have to i'd think once or twice but i think i'd probably do it just for the experience i guess but it'd be pretty interesting that's for sure	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh yeah you couldn't- couldn't pass it up that's for sure	3816	A
you think it'll ever happen where they'll let it'll be common or	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
yeah that's true	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
yeah i'm i'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station they're talking about you know i think that'd be a step to where you know in the right direction but	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
yeah i'd uh just the way we progress i- i like i say i'd hate to see them_1 cut out the the budget there's a lot of places	3816	A
you know that can use it but just you know simple things like Teflon stuff like that all came from the Apollo mission yeah things they developed	3816	A
you know	3816	A
in that program you know i mean- mean- mean just common everyday things that we take for granted but	3816	A
you know that's as an offshoot it's kind of like the military budget you know there's a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military	3816	A
that we end up using just a you know everyday stuff but something like that Teflon something you take for granted you use it every day but	3816	A
if it hadn't of been for something like that you'd never you know really you may not have got it so	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
well they said yeah	3816	A
uh-huh they say in you know in weightlessness they're they're able to do a lot of different things with the chemicals and minerals that they can't do with the gravity so	3816	A
there could be some valuable- i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i	3816	A
yeah i think it's	3816	A
they've been a little concerned because it's kind of chilly it's cold you know like you say so they're a little worried about the	3816	A
same thing that happened to the Challenger but they are going up to do some tests with some organisms- uh organisms and stuff and weightlessness to see how they uh	3816	A
how they react to that and everything but so i think i think you're right though they're getting little better and better sooner- sooner- you know sooner or later they're going to make some major breakthroughs	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah it's just a matter of time i guess nothing ever comes without- nothing ever comes without some effort so	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
oh really i hadn't heard that	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
huh	3816	A
so it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they started or	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
card yourself or	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
yeah it's i work at a at a financial institution and seen quite a bit used to be a loan officer and	3800	A
seen people with you know they've had well i've seen a person with forty thousand dollars in limits and about twenty thousand dollars of it used and i and we we've got one but it's just for absolute emergencies we hardly ever use it	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
for sure	3800	A
yeah they uh they can like you say you can once you start using them they they're always real- real willing to raise those limits for you that's for sure	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
no they can afford to write off a lot more	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
that's excuse me yeah that's true i uh	3800	A
well i can't see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i can't imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because_1 there's-	3800	A
yeah well that make you- you know that makes sense i guess if they're they're not willing to write off as much but	3800	A
you know it there's a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we sent- we'll take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars cost- or a year for the just the fee and everything it	3800	A
i don't know i just i have a hard time i like i say i	3800	A
working in a financial institution i just i'm really rate conscious i guess and can't see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
yep there's i imagine there's there's quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they don't have to charge- you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that can't pay it off monthly and get	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
yeah that's true	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah i uh i- i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt they've got it just seems like they're	3800	A
they right now they can't afford to buy anymore because they're up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know that's part of the reason i think everything's kind of stalled out but	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
that exactly you know when that thing was they were trying to pass through- through- that through Congress they the thing that Congress didn't realize is that yeah they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and you know it would slow you know they were trying to	3800	A
pick things up but it would just it do wouldn't do any good because you know the banks aren't stupid they're going to realize that they can't you know they can't keep affording to write off five percent if they're only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
that's true	3800	A
that's true	3800	A
i don't know what will happen like i say we're sure trying we we just got the one and we just don't want to get any more	3800	A
no	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
if it's not huh huh where do you work at	3800	A
oh do you	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
um	3800	A
uh yeah	3800	A
turn in the voucher	3800	A
um	3800	A
uh yes uh uh not as much as i used to we used to have quite a few credit cards and over the the last few years we've tried to cut them back a little bit and and uh down to mainly- mainly one each uh	3800	B
uh it's it's easy to let them_1 get out of control	3800	B
oh	3800	B
yeah yeah that's uh that's what we try to to go to uh and eliminate all the uh uh department store uh credit cards uh got rid of all those	3800	B
yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they don't have to be as credit conscious they can	3800	B
yeah they can write off a lot more losses now	3800	B
uh which which i kind of disagree uh with i'd rather them_1 going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates	3800	B
yeah i i've heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
well- yeah	3800	B
well well people- people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they don't look at at spending uh eighteen percent on on credit it's uh for some reason they don't look at it that way	3800	B
that	3800	B
that's that's true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them_1 off but there's	3800	B
sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them_1 off but	3800	B
but the people who who can't afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it it's sort of like the federal government	3800	B
yes that's right	3800	B
well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh	3800	B
uh i think it would only mean that they'd they'd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and they'd probably make just as much money they just wouldn't write off as many losses	3800	B
yeah that's that's right	3800	B
yes uh	3800	B
well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didn't look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and that's in uh in real estate and other things and it's the same with credit cards	3800	B
yeah we i- i use a company one somewhat uh uh to- to uh	3800	B
do air travel and all but uh i make sure that one's always uh paid off because_1 i'm responsible for the interest on that one if if i don't pay it off uh uh	3800	B
i work for uh an oil company and they they issue a an American Express card so that you don't have to ask for uh expense advances when you have to travel and buy air tickets so	3800	B
so you just use your card but it's but it's in your name so it's up to you to pay it off and and because it's American Express you can't run up a a credit on it so that	3800	B
okay you're probably uh more up on this subject than i am but	3809	A
the roles that women have played the last couple- couple of year in our are couple of generations	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last	3809	A
oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling	3809	A
you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry uh	3809	A
there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five- five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and	3809	A
you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
you bet that's sort of neat	3809	A
sure i think uh it's the age- age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that	3809	A
you know women are paid less than men and they're and they're doing the same uh	3809	A
or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way	3809	A
and	3809	A
i think so hope so and-	3809	A
absolutely-	3809	A
you know i've	3809	A
right yeah they forget also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know	3809	A
if if a a woman Congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever	3809	A
so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way	3809	A
but i guess just the most significant thing- change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going	3809	A
and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good a good statement	3809	A
and i think if in the future it's even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant	3809	A
wow	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
good point	3809	A
right now i'm self employed and and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my business uh she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so	3809	A
you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business and she still works everyday so	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
uh-oh enjoying- enjoying it what kind of work do you do	3809	A
well good	3809	A
right married	3809	A
yeah	3809	A
well- well	3809	A
trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject	3809	A
you see the old uh	3809	A
cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way	3809	A
baby right and uh you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that and	3809	A
it's really true women have come a long way and you know	3809	A
that	3809	B
right well they've entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started	3809	B
and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah the you see more of that you see more of them_1 uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too	3809	B
you know i- i go to a i have a club that i belong to Altrusa that you know one of the girls travels quite extensively and she said well my children have two parents you know why not	3809	B
so that that's a i think that's a change and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing	3809	B
right	3809	B
no that that i think should change will change in the near future also it's been changing it's been evolving but there's still a an	3809	B
an inequality in the work force in certain jobs it's you know and you hear some people say you know well he's a man he he he needs that salary	3809	B
right	3809	B
and going yeah um-hum	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah i- i think it will be i think i well another- another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they're out there i guess is that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind	3809	B
um because in the past the male bought the cars but now they're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases	3809	B
and that they are looking for um	3809	B
different things in the car the man is looking for the engine- in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel	3809	B
uh can her makeup come off the upholstery and if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out there that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah we all do	3809	B
i'm just happen to be off today so i work too	3809	B
i'm a nurse	3809	B
and i work at Medical Treatment Center um which is at Garland- uh Jupiter and Arapaho	3809	B
no	3809	B
i don't know	3809	B
i'm kind of out of out of things	3809	B
you've come a long way baby	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah	3869	A
um-hum um-hum	3869	A
uh well i agree with you there i feel that there's	3869	A
there's is a turning point ahead- still ahead of us we haven't gotten there yet	3869	A
excuse me but i do think that	3869	A
there is a greater awareness of the the benefits that the the feminine side of people offers you know as well as men you know when you	3869	A
half a generation ago wouldn't have even considered as feasible	3869	A
um-hum	3869	A
um-hum	3869	A
yes	3869	A
that's true that is fairly recent	3869	A
uh-huh	3869	A
i feel- i definitely feel that that's true in the political arena it's gonna be a lot longer before women are in positions of authority- authority on a on a majority basis you know there's always gonna be a a few but	3869	A
you know whereas in education and in health care women dominate because those are seen as supportive roles	3869	A
i think it's interesting to just look at the history of women in history- in in several cultures to to determine why in Western culture	3869	A
they take the role that they do because it's- it's a matriarchial society in a lot of different parts of the world that that puts women in a much stronger position and yet in the west it's	3869	A
just coming around to the point that we can recognize that the power that that a woman offers to the society you know in terms of nurturing as well as	3869	A
um-hum um-hum	3869	A
that's exciting	3869	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3869	A
uh still a lot of that influence	3869	A
yes yes and there's so much that's	3869	A
um {inculturated} we don't realize in the home how we're	3869	A
how we're influenced i think that even though my parents might've said you know i'm i'm in an area uh health care where there are a lot of women obviously but	3869	A
my orientation was never toward being a physician it was toward being a health care provider in another area and	3869	A
even though i heard from my my father it certainly go you know pursue as far as you can you can be a physician there was this under lying tone in our home because my mom did not work outside the home that it was also okay to not do that and so	3869	A
it's been a challenge to to cope with both of my orientations i- i have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside the home	3869	A
um-hum hum	3869	A
yes i think that over time we will recognize what	3869	A
our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather that- that are different from men and and it's okay that	3869	A
that there are some differences but that there are also a lot more areas that can overlap that that at this point don't i think girls are told that they're probably not gonna be as good at math as as boys are and and they they	3869	A
they may be influenced by that in their school work	3869	A
i don't know if i was by my by the influence or whether i just am not very oriented in math as i am to other like verbal	3869	A
okay um i think although there have been some i'm still of the opinion that we're second rate citizens in most areas	3869	B
uh i believe probably World War II is when you know the thing started that caused	3869	B
women to be more liberated because the men were at war and they needed women in the factories and things have never been the same	3869	B
as far as the	3869	B
as far as the job market women started working outside the home then but it's taken a long time and i think we've got a long way to go	3869	B
yeah i agree with that	3869	B
um-hum	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
no	3869	B
no and then i think it's a good turn i do see uh one of the reasons i also believe there's a lot to be ahead as i return to college and uh	3869	B
i see girls of twenty or so they think there is no problem they don't realize the struggle's just at the last few years	3869	B
for them especially to go into professions that they could've just been laughed at and it can't be done anymore at least legally it can't be done	3869	B
i think	3869	B
yes and i think- just like today i mean it- may be	3869	B
people that don't want you in a certain profession they can't state it where i don't think the change has come like from the men's side is they can still feel it	3869	B
you know i think	3869	B
yes	3869	B
yes	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
um-hum	3869	B
yeah	3869	B
right	3869	B
yeah i wasn't aware of that either until uh just a year ago when i took a sociology course that even existed that's how indoctrinated i was	3869	B
but then i'm forty six i grew up with the generation of the guys my brothers went to college and i'm now struggling to no and it	3869	B
wasn't important you know you go be a secretary or be a beautician	3869	B
that was my choice and uh	3869	B
but yeah i didn't even realize there were societies like you say where women were were important	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
well i find myself looking towards what i'm doing and i'm leaning towards education and that's still another area of women but	3869	B
that's what i wanna do you know have made- i have made that decision that that's what i want to do even if it is the traditional thing it's still what i wanna do and i know it's like	3869	B
right	3869	B
yes i'm suffering- suffering through that too yeah	3869	B
i was very seriously	3869	B
well i'm not because i have been tested by the office-	3869	B
let's see um	3836	A
have you heard anything in particular about the universal health care system- uh health insurance program that they're talking about	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
and it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan	3836	A
yeah especially for major corporations	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yes	3836	A
well	3836	A
oh yeah they keep uh the AMA you've got to go through the AMA to get accepted into medical school	3836	A
and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in	3836	A
but uh now dental school that's yeah if they've got a glut on the market of dentists um	3836	A
i i i don't mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high	3836	A
and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i don't think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such	3836	A
that's probably the worst thing about health care right now is the unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice and	3836	A
it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didn't do something wrong rather than proving that he did	3836	A
and if he doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right	3836	A
then suddenly he's got you know two or three years wages down the toilet but uh	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
uh-huh	3836	A
yeah there are physicians getting away with murder	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yes	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah uh	3836	A
from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion	3836	A
they're not feeling you know insulted they're it's like that's a little you know sweat off my brow simply because	3836	A
i mean you know they're- they're covering their own tail legally and you know a second opinion	3836	A
well i haven't heard any of the specific details of uh what they have planned but uh	3836	B
basically the noise around Washington is that uh they're concerned that uh there's not enough health care insurance provided that uh very few families have uh health care insurance or	3836	B
any kind of uh coverage where they're employed	3836	B
uh i'm not sure that there's any real plan afoot	3836	B
to uh bring a health care plan on line that requires everybody to kick in like uh Social Security	3836	B
but uh one of the plan that's been circulated about is a requirement	3836	B
that employers provide uh health care insurance for their employees and kick in something like eighty percent of the cost of that insurance	3836	B
and uh if they don't do that then they have to pay into a federal fund that provides the uh health care insurance	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
i tell you one thing that uh we were discussing this evening here that uh discourages me a little bit and worries me about the health care system	3836	B
uh i know that certainly in this region uh that the number of students graduating from dental school has been quite large	3836	B
and a lot of the foreign students that uh came and stayed in this country didn't go back home	3836	B
so there's been a kind of dentists are kind of glut on the market and they're uh having a lot of trouble competing and making ends meet	3836	B
and uh physicians i think may be facing the same situation except they apparently have a very strong	3836	B
organization and they are actually preventing students from entering medical college	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
well i think that's sort of happened universally to all our industries i think our light plane industry went out of business because the uh cost of uh manufacturers' product liability was too high	3836	B
uh but i think on the other side of the coin that uh maybe the AMA is being a little bit too protective of some of their physicians uh	3836	B
yeah i've i've got my own set of war stories uh my daughter uh turns out she's allergic to gnats	3836	B
and the first time i went in to have it treated it cost two thousand five hundred dollars	3836	B
and the second time i went to a different doctor and the doctor said oh she's allergic to gnats give her some Benadryl that was a two dollar and forty five cent treatment for it	3836	B
and so uh you know four days in the hospital the children's ward on IV penicillin uh was a lot less effective than a couple of teaspoons full of Benadryl	3836	B
and i have other friends that uh have really been misdiagnosed	3836	B
and i think it's probably a shame that there isn't more competition among doctors and there isn't a little more policing	3836	B
uh of the results	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
yeah	3875	B
i use to i don't now	3875	B
oh really	3875	B
yeah that is what it is in Arizona Arizona is where i am from	3875	B
i have only been in California for about two years	3875	B
and in Arizona that is all they have too is man made lakes because of the desert	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
well i lived in Washington State for a while do you know where do you know where Seattle is well it's about thirty miles outside of Seattle there is a place called Westport	3875	B
and it use to be the salmon capitol of the world and when i lived	3875	B
yeah when i lived there i use to go deep sea fishing with my dad all the time and it was really it was really neat but when i went back to Arizona because_1 that is where i am from well when i went back there to be with my mom	3875	B
it was like a totally different kind of fishing i was like ah what do i do	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
i haven't i haven't been fishing since i've been to California because_1 i have been having my kids and	3875	B
two	3875	B
two little boys	3875	B
one's three and one's one	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
sounds like fun	3875	B
i'm stopping at two	3875	B
yes	3875	B
i only want to have to teach two of them how to fish i don't want to have to teach four	3875	B
oh	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
yeah it's amazing how few women actually fish	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
uh-huh	3875	B
yeah my husband gets kind of upset because him and i have an agreement	3875	B
i i'll bait my own hook and i'll catch the fish but he's the one cleaning them because_1 i won't clean them that's the only thing i will not do	3875	B
and uh	3875	B
he gets really disgusted because_1 he he says i i talk to the fish i don't talk to the fish they just jump on my hook	3875	B
that's what he says because i'm really lucky at catching them_1	3875	B
no matter what kind of fishing we are doing i i seem to have really good luck and it's like i don't talk to um and they just jump on my hook i don't know	3875	B
yeah my mom got remarried and she got remarried to uh a commercial fisherman	3875	B
and he was like women don't know how to fish and {da} {da} {da} {da} so him and i went out fishing one day	3875	B
and i and he goes do you need me to bait your hook and i said no i can handle it	3875	B
and so i baited my hook and by the time we left i had six and he had none	3875	B
he goes he goes tell you what	3875	B
why don't you do my job for a while	3875	B
i said no thanks cause i don't clean them	3875	B
so he cleaned them all and i gave him and my mom four of them and i just took two of them	3875	B
but he was just so disgusted because he had never seen anybody that had that good of luck	3875	B
oh yeah i love fish	3875	B
i i grew up in Arizona so i guess that's why because	3875	B
so fishing huh	3875	A
you do much fishing out there	3875	A
did	3875	A
well you know we moved from California we moved from northern California to come out here and uh i	3875	A
we did quite a quite a bit of fishing out there but uh out here in uh in Texas it's all man made lake	3875	A
oh is that right	3875	A
oh	3875	A
yeah well that's kind of the thing here in in Dallas and it's it's a whole different kind of fishing than	3875	A
than uh i uh am use to in California i'm use to deep sea fishing out there and fishing off the pier and stuff and uh out here in Dallas you have to use lures and	3875	A
uh all kinds of different things i haven't had a chance to go out fishing much here but i use to do a lot of fishing out in California	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
oh yeah	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
wow they did a lot of salmon fishing up there then	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
yeah it is and uh the bait that they use is uh is totally different in California than it is here in Texas and uh	3875	A
um you know we uh use to use live bait in in California and they do use some live bait here but not a not uh whole lot not like you know you use to use in California and uh	3875	A
yeah how many kids do you have	3875	A
two	3875	A
two little boys	3875	A
wow you got two little ones then huh well i have got four i have got a twelve year old an eleven and uh	3875	A
six and a three	3875	A
so	3875	A
you are oh	3875	A
that's true	3875	A
oh that's we use to have a lot of fun when i was actually my my two boys were born here in Texas but	3875	A
uh my two girls i use to take them with me when when uh we would go fishing you know and my wife and i use to like fishing off the pier and stuff and we'd catch uh shoot one time she she caught a couple of sharks off the pier	3875	A
and uh you know we caught uh what do you call uh those flat things	3875	A
and we you know we'd get crab and stuff off the pier and and uh	3875	A
that's that's stuff that we that we miss um being here in Texas we don't have much of a chance to get out to the coast and and uh	3875	A
yeah my wife loved to fish she didn't like to uh she doesn't like to put the bait on but	3875	A
you know that was my job i just put the bait on and she'd catch the fish in fact we use to go out and and this was not really that funny at the time but	3875	A
it's funny now you know i'd we would get two poles	3875	A
and i would you know i hook hers up she would be out there and i haven't uh i i i wouldn't even be able to tie my hook on	3875	A
she'd catch a fish and she would yell at me to come and take the fish off so i'd take it off and walk back and put my hook on she'd call again to get get the fish off her hook	3875	A
i mean it went like that for a whole hour	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
you'd talk to the fish	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
yeah	3875	A
well uh that's my wife	3875	A
yeah that's my wife uh every time we go fishing she's the one that catches them and i'm the one that takes them off and baits the hook and then it goes all over again so	3875	A
oh is that right	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
oh my heck	3875	A
oh that's funny	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
now do you like eating uh eating fish	3875	A
is that right	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh well we're right between uh Milwaukee and Chicago	3822	A
so there's there's just been a big Coke bust uh here because i think people pass through	3822	A
you know on their way back and forth through the bigger cities	3822	A
um it's it's okay i mean there's crime everywhere it it's	3822	A
probably not	3822	A
it's not you know the	3822	A
best place	3822	A
to be but	3822	A
yeah it's right next to Racine	3822	A
oh really	3822	A
uh	3822	A
yeah-	3822	A
oh yeah it's like ten minutes away from me	3822	A
no	3822	A
really it's that bad	3822	A
the crime- because of the crime	3822	A
wow	3822	A
with the	3822	A
oh yeah	3822	A
no it's not	3822	A
it	3822	A
it yeah it's gotten worse too nothing's getting better	3822	A
seems like it's always getting worse	3822	A
i think it has to get worse first before it can get better	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
they need something and it	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
i heard uh Dallas cops are really strict like	3822	A
oh yeah	3822	A
whoa	3822	A
yeah same here certain parts of our city uh you just don't go by you just don't	3822	A
because_1 then you're asking for trouble	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
twenty one	3822	A
yep	3822	A
twenty three	3822	A
yeah uh	3822	A
actually uh my sister lives in Racine	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
it's bigger than Kenosha by a little bit and their crime rate's crime rate's a lot worse than ours	3822	A
yeah they just some guy uh couple months ago he got out a machete did you read about that and started just hacking people in the street with it	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
oh that was in Racine	3822	A
it's sad i mean you can't even drive or walk down the street at night or anything	3822	A
i've heard of that	3822	A
uh-huh	3822	A
uh how- how's the crime rate up there	3822	B
okay	3822	B
uh-huh	3822	B
yeah	3822	B
right	3822	B
is it anywhere near Racine	3822	B
really my uh old old girlfriend uh was from there	3822	B
yeah uh actually i went- i went and saw her about four years ago her parents had moved to Chicago and uh	3822	B
at this point they had moved out of Dallas and everything then they had moved back and she was going to school down here and i went and saw her one summer and uh we went up there	3822	B
i never been up there i just remember	3822	B
it's a different area from down here obviously but uh	3822	B
uh so you're a cheese head huh yeah well we're i mean down here i mean Dallas i mean this crime rate's ridiculous i mean it's just	3822	B
i'm getting ready to move actually in the probably the next year or so so i mean but	3822	B
it's it yeah i mean it isn't Washington DC but it's there's just so many uh	3822	B
i mean we've had like four or five uh since school started like uh in high school people uh	3822	B
incidents where kids shooting you know a teacher or you know since you know the school year and everything like New Year's Eve there were three people shot right away i mean like in the first ten minutes of the new year you know so	3822	B
it's just been it's ridiculous there's a lot of problems right now i mean the uh	3822	B
the police chief out here is the former assistant police chief uh Darryl Gates in LA	3822	B
so i mean he's not like you know beating up anybody but	3822	B
there's just it's a big city and it's what you know you get and there's there's just getting a lot it's getting overcrowded and there's a lot of uh	3822	B
immigrants from uh Mexico and stuff so	3822	B
it's it's it's getting pretty ridiculous	3822	B
but uh	3822	B
i'm sure you know since you're near Chicago i'm sure you could	3822	B
it's not exactly a peaceful city either you know	3822	B
so it's the same situation really	3822	B
so i'm actually in Richardson which is just north of Dallas it's a little suburb	3822	B
but	3822	B
yeah i mean	3822	B
yeah i don't see how it can get better i mean it's got to totally	3822	B
yeah stricter laws or something that	3822	B
uh	3822	B
if i could solve problems i'd be a rich person but guess i can't	3822	B
i'm just it's one of those deals where i mean you know try to look at you know look at at other countries what they do but i mean we're not like barbarics uh i don't	3822	B
you know it's just too many problems with uh people getting paroled before- uh you know early and coming out committing another crime while they're still on probation we've had a lot of problems out here with that course	3822	B
well it's it's kind of yeah they shoot first then ask questions later you know that's that's their motto	3822	B
they're they're not uh	3822	B
you got to be careful if i mean i never had a problem i mean i'm not like	3822	B
hang- just you just don't hang out in Dallas or you got to be you know where not to be at night and the you know	3822	B
just are certain places you don't even	3822	B
certain parts of town you just stay away from you know	3822	B
right and you just	3822	B
yeah you just leave it alone i mean	3822	B
oh yeah oh	3822	B
how old are you	3822	B
twenty one yeah	3822	B
oh i'm twenty three	3822	B
yeah uh	3822	B
that's pretty wild right next to Racine huh	3822	B
really	3822	B
God i never thought i would ever run into somebody	3822	B
look i'll read the paper every now and then and something Racine Wisconsin will pop out you know but yeah it's just kind of a little town um	3822	B
really	3822	B
with- with the machete no i didn't hear about that	3822	B
God	3822	B
well uh in Wheaton Illinois where her parents live and that's where that uh	3822	B
yeah it's just like forty five miles outside of Chicago and few years ago i guess there was some uh	3822	B
i think it was some	3822	B
um some lady was like shot- uh	3822	B
killed- attacked some school children-	3822	B
okay i pushed it	3899	A
so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution	3899	A
yeah well you know what i was talking to my brother in Denver	3899	A
and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace	3899	A
yeah i couldn't believe-	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
yeah i can't understand-	3899	A
yeah i just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places that's all that all the heat they have in their home	3899	A
you know	3899	A
well i know yeah isn't that terrible	3899	A
well i don't know all i know is that we have to have our car- our car smogged every two years you know and um	3899	A
um-hum well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just they don't wanna they wanna use uh	3899	A
you know something that's gonna burn all this gas where we can buy more gas you know	3899	A
um um-hum um-hum	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
well i don't know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down Southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this	3899	A
crud you know it oh it's terrible	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
yeah	3899	A
yeah it- it- it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these trucks that's on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those trucks just smoke like heck you know	3899	A
but it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
no the electric cars i think that was a good idea i would really go for that	3899	A
yeah right right	3899	A
i	3899	A
um-hum um-hum	3899	A
um-hum um-hum	3899	A
yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that we're gonna be in the house all day	3899	A
you know and it's just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i don't use mine	3899	A
yeah right-	3899	A
right right	3899	A
yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large companies and uh-huh	3899	A
right- right right right so	3899	A
uh-huh	3899	B
okay	3899	B
well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that we're we're doing way too much of that although i'm not sure	3899	B
the one thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whether- how whether that's a very serious one or not um	3899	B
you know uh with	3899	B
well that's what i've heard it kills me because i love fires and i and i really really care about pollution and i don't use anything that's got the the the stuff- stuff- the	3899	B
stuff in it you know the spray bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but that's the one thing that i think is	3899	B
very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural	3899	B
that's a that's a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but	3899	B
that that that's what they have yeah but um i you know i- i am really concerned about it because you can you're beginning to- well you're beginning to see the air	3899	B
and and that's frightening and i know in California uh a whole lot is being done i don't know how well that's working and if all those things all those laws went through	3899	B
about about the for the car manufacturers and everything and- has that do you know	3899	B
yeah	3899	B
uh-huh	3899	B
but i think what they're gonna do is try to get the try to get the car manufacturers to make cars that you know use gasoline more- more- uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel	3899	B
yes i think that's right i think that's right but it's scary what it's doing to to stone buildings	3899	B
you know the the acid rain i mean destroying things trees are dying lot of forests are are dying of these uh in Canada and in in uh	3899	B
i don't know about_1 i don't know about_1 in California	3899	B
um-hum um-hum	3899	B
yeah well and- and i had not experienced it as much my son went to Pomona and he went	3899	B
the school starts in the fall and that is the notorious smog season so when he first went out there about five- you know five-	3899	B
uh a long time ago four or five years ago but anyway he- he called and just said mother now i know what they're talking about i mean this stuff you really feel you can't breathe	3899	B
uh-huh	3899	B
yeah yeah yeah	3899	B
no i know and and as far as what i you know i do things about almost everything else but as far as the air is concerned i am trying to buy a new car but there are no cars available with clean fuel	3899	B
so i can't do that um i just	3899	B
yeah yeah	3899	B
uh yeah i would too but that and it it's not affordable and it's not out there	3899	B
and then i have stopped using anything but pump sprays so that i'm trying to get i'm trying not to use that whatever that's called chlorofluorocarbons-	3899	B
some kind of anyway that's that's hurting the ozone uh level i'm trying not to do that	3899	B
oh no no no i didn't either yes	3899	B
yeah	3899	B
yeah but	3899	B
no and i i'm not sure i'm not sure that this is something that air pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of the other ones	3899	B
uh like recycling or even water you know water use or saving water and that's what's scary to me	3899	B
large companies that's right industry and the car manufacturers	3899	B
and uh that we have less control i guess it depends on who we vote for and how we write	3899	B
you know write letters to them	3899	B
well what do you think about your everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy	3845	A
oh	3845	A
right	3845	A
yeah i think that that's the only thing i wrote down also because that's just a	3845	A
it's terrible today i mean my wife and i it seems like i get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and and it rings up until ten and- eleven o'clock sometimes	3845	A
yes i know -that's true	3845	A
yeah that's true	3845	A
but you know people	3845	A
it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls	3845	A
i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day and and a lot a days i'll get to and three calls from	3845	A
from people selling insurance you know to the small business man	3845	A
and uh you know i think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your according to what i've understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in New York and uh	3845	A
California always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever	3845	A
and now i getting the same calls at at the house	3845	A
and they get your- and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet and uh credit card companies they sell your name	3845	A
i know	3845	A
yes	3845	A
American Express does that by the way	3845	A
yeah i understand they sell their- you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them_1	3845	A
and uh that is an invasion of privacy you're right	3845	A
i know that's true	3845	A
exactly magazine companies uh from from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money	3845	A
but it's uh you know i guess it uh you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an American Express card so your name is valuable to i guess X amount of solicitors calling	3845	A
so i don't know	3845	A
where- where do you where you from	3845	A
oh okay well so yeah we live in the Dallas area Richardson	3845	A
okay laughter	3845	A
did you	3845	A
yeah i've got i talked to people in Utah people in New York and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and i'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state	3845	A
i'll be darn where you from not from Texas	3845	A
New Jersey right yeah yeah my wife's from New Jersey	3845	A
yeah from uh Saddle River	3845	A
she	3845	A
okay	3845	A
well that's nice too	3845	A
really yes- my wife's been away since- we've been married twenty five years so she she's been away for quite a while	3845	A
her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas and her mother was from New York so they just	3845	A
they officed over there in New Jersey	3845	A
so but anyway yeah this topic is it's a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that's the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling	3845	A
i know	3845	A
that's a that's a good suggestion i might start using the answering machine more because you know it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings	3845	A
right	3845	A
sure	3845	A
you yeah you're probably right	3845	A
i understand i mean i it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriff's association and and	3845	A
i know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival- carnival or circus and then	3845	A
right there's always a different- and and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night	3845	A
uh	3845	B
well the uh what i really i don't like is the call- the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things	3845	B
you know people trying to solicit for different you know organizations	3845	B
now that's what i really	3845	B
never stops ringing right	3845	B
that's right well you know the the great uh things of that its a is is an answering machine i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know you just switch that thing on and uh	3845	B
yeah	3845	B
hum even in an office	3845	B
uh-huh	3845	B
right	3845	B
um-hum	3845	B
right right	3845	B
um-hum i know	3845	B
oh yeah uh well you know these people they sell your names i mean you know i that's also an invasion of privacy i think if the whole thing is a	3845	B
oh they do	3845	B
well sure it is	3845	B
that's right well you know if you've ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever	3845	B
um-hum	3845	B
that's right	3845	B
yeah that's right	3845	B
but	3845	B
oh i'm from Texas	3845	B
oh well- we're in Plano	3845	B
well you know the only call i really got that well was out of state i got one from Oklahoma City and one from California	3845	B
and that was uh California i was thrilled to death because that's the you know the furthest i'd gotten any call from you know and um	3845	B
oh really	3845	B
oh	3845	B
yeah see well that's uh that- there was another call on Saturday- Saturday that was also from uh that was the one from California	3845	B
i don't know why i guess people on the weekends from out of state -will uh i don't know you know but	3845	B
uh originally from New Jersey	3845	B
yeah	3845	B
oh really what part	3845	B
oh that's nice over there yeah we're from more uh from a sort of towards the shore central New Jersey you know we're like uh	3845	B
yeah oh yeah it was beautiful that's why i- i really miss it i- i don't really like it here at all	3845	B
uh-huh	3845	B
yeah so their	3845	B
yeah	3845	B
well yeah i mean yeah yeah and and you- know- of course they call you know before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd i the you know i the the minute i get home the phone would be ringing uh	3845	B
oh it's great i mean	3845	B
uh you know uh end this call press three and i assumed i was you know was from the switchboard you know yeah it is because_1 one day i listened you know and it was	3845	B
you know but um i- i just got totally disgusted and and you know people asking for for money for everything you know i mean it-	3845	B
exactly and you know the policeman's association and-	3845	B
oh i used to do that yeah i used to do that i'd say- or three kids to the movies or something	3845	B
okay	3855	B
oh we use them	3855	B
for paying our gas	3855	B
for paying	3855	B
uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks so we use it quite a bit	3855	B
but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards	3855	B
if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free so we never have to pay anything extra	3855	B
yeah we just don't think it's worth it	3855	B
so	3855	B
uh-huh	3855	B
see well you i don't do it either	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
yes exactly that's how i feel- i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something	3855	B
yeah and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our MasterCard or whatever	3855	B
and then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later	3855	B
and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a little- even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later	3855	B
oh yeah	3855	B
yeah even if it's five bucks even	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in	3855	B
and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt	3855	B
you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then	3855	B
you know you can have your card back with	3855	B
pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever	3855	B
i know	3855	B
yeah exactly	3855	B
yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody	3855	B
yeah so	3855	B
um	3855	B
oh i also use like to use Discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year	3855	B
yeah yeah	3855	B
well we just started doing that and	3855	B
you know what it comes in handy is for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes	3855	B
because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but i mean it's still something we got two fifty last year	3855	B
and so it's you know it helps out here and there	3855	B
so	3855	B
yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year	3855	B
and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something	3855	B
and so that's what	3855	B
and i know we're going to get back more this year because they	3855	B
you know we spent a little bit more	3855	B
probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too	3855	B
and they increase the percentage a little bit	3855	B
yeah i pushed in	3855	A
so how do you use your credit cards	3855	A
um-hum	3855	A
yeah that's me i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee	3855	A
you know and um i'm uh like you i i use it	3855	A
well to buy my gas with my Shell- my Shell credit card i use that	3855	A
and then like my Emporium card and uh	3855	A
Weinstocks card i use that but i'm like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i don't just write a check i don't know	3855	A
you know it's just really weird but i i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse	3855	A
yeah you know enough for a phone call and that's about all	3855	A
but uh	3855	A
other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't- they can't charge any more	3855	A
you know and i think that's terrible	3855	A
oh yeah	3855	A
yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why	3855	A
it really does help	3855	A
yeah	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because you- there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket	3855	A
they're going to hit you over the head	3855	A
i know it just uh you know it just seems like they're somebody's always watching	3855	A
so i just don't i don't carry money i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know	3855	A
right	3855	A
yeah	3855	A
yeah right	3855	A
yeah right	3855	A
and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything	3855	A
you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amount- i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you	3855	A
you know so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
well let's see what else can i say about credit cards	3855	A
um	3855	A
yeah i don't i don't uh that that that's that Sears Discovery Card is that what that	3855	A
yeah now i don't have that one you know	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
oh you mean uh for for you using your credit card you get like a rebate or something	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
oh i see	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
um i see	3855	A
yeah well i'll	3855	A
well it's uh certainly would would help things out uh i don't see a terribly lot of it going on uh here	3871	B
i was actually quite surprised i went to uh San Francisco recently uh to Berkeley and and uh	3871	B
they actually have mandatory recycling- well no theirs theirs is not mandatory i'm sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see everybody with you know with with ten bags of things and they and they have a community recycling center uh where	3871	B
rather than than having monetary incentives for the for the people that actually bring stuff into recycling they're just doing it to help out the city and then the city can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled	3871	B
yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off of it um	3871	B
it's just the recycling per se but uh we do very little uh recycle newspapers but other than that	3871	B
kind of a shame	3871	B
um-hum um-hum	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
right	3871	B
yeah i- i- i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling centers that is what i saw in Berkeley was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh	3871	B
in different- in each for different things uh uh you know they even had a specific- specific of course being in wine country they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the wineries would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly	3871	B
yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them_1 uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the aluminum and then for plastics and	3871	B
apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe ten fifteen blocks away from where these friend of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didn't get anything for it but but um	3871	B
you know the thing is that that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the the proceeds from from recycled things	3871	B
yeah that's what i am saying you know they could pay for if they you know if they have to have somebody there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff	3871	B
you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling the glass or or aluminum or whatever	3871	B
and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where people brought books they didn't want put them on the shelf and people- anybody- you just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and	3871	B
it was uh it was quite a quite an operation	3871	B
yeah	3871	B
no no it's	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
yeah	3871	B
oh oh i haven't seen those now i- i- i think i have seen them_1 actually going with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans people put them out separately	3871	B
and they'll they'll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the truck or something but	3871	B
hm yeah i- i- i think that that there's a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling	3871	B
is is a is a little bit wrong you know certainly there's money- you know -it's valuable to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so	3871	B
um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give people money for it	3871	B
oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but there's a lot of computer paper generated so it's you know generally clean white paper	3871	B
and uh	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
oh	3871	B
well what do you think about recycling	3871	A
i don't see a lot of it here either	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
well i think if they had some place up up up in your area like i know they don't here	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
that's true	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
we we do our cans and stuff but um	3871	A
um you know i don't know if i- if there is someplace close by where you could take everything i know in our neighborhood every so often every few months they'll put in our subdivision they'll put out um	3871	A
like dump trucks so you can get rid of your trash and garbage in your yard and they'll haul it off for you and it is all free if they did something like that and they they'll get a chipper you know like in the spring and in the fall	3871	A
if they did the same thing for recycling i think that would go over real well	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
wow	3871	A
and recycle them	3871	A
were they all over the community	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
right	3871	A
well it couldn't like glass companies buy the glass back from uh the city or something like that	3871	A
right	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
well i'll be	3871	A
well that's pretty neat maybe it'll catch on all over but i haven't really seen it around here hardly at all	3871	A
um i have seen where one um i think trash company will put out you put out a bin but it it was never explained what you put in it	3871	A
you know and do they really you know i haven't seen a special kind of a truck oh in this area now i've seen them_1 uh around Austin uh some they're- they're like three division trucks you know it has three compartments	3871	A
huh	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
right	3871	A
yeah i know i know if they did something like that at work you know if they separated paper where i work they don't even separate the paper	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
now see they don't even do it where i work for a private laboratory and you know that uh ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it and they they shred all of it	3871	A
you know and i would think you know and i see them_1 carry them_1 out	3871	A
it's beautiful it's wonderful i love it it's not January	3878	B
it's sunny there's a few light wispy little clouds floating around there's a light breeze it's about sixty three degrees	3878	B
it's wonderful my son and i have been out for a couple of walks today	3878	B
yeah	3878	B
um it stopped raining	3878	B
let's see	3878	B
Monday- Monday or Tuesday Monday it stopped raining it's been raining	3878	B
until then	3878	B
was it	3878	B
and it's but it has been real icky well no it it rained Monday night it rained	3878	B
it stopped raining Monday night like Tuesday it was it was clear but it's been really nasty the clouds have been over cast even though it's been kind of warm so that it is muggy	3878	B
that wasn't very good either	3878	B
uh we did we got snow about a week and a half ago	3878	B
and it was it was really wild because uh	3878	B
the snow was um	3878	B
it didn't stick	3878	B
but it flurried and you could see it	3878	B
but it uh it didn't stick any	3878	B
yeah it was nice it turned into it was like rain it because it was warm even it was above freezing	3878	B
but it was between uh	3878	B
just where the clouds were and where you know but when the snow got down here	3878	B
it was cold enough to freeze it and then it just stayed frozen it was wet snow i guess is what they call it when is starts thawing before it hits the ground	3878	B
really	3878	B
oh yeah well i am wondering about the summer what is summer going to be like if winter is this temperate	3878	B
we are bound to have a real dozy of a summer	3878	B
but	3878	B
i don't know i've i've had um i have Easter lilies that i grow in my back yard and they have already started up	3878	B
and it's way too early	3878	B
for Easter lilies they shouldn't be up until March when the the flowers actually start to bloom	3878	B
already coming in bloom	3878	B
oh please	3878	B
i- i put down crocus this year thinking oh well it will get cold in January and February you know and i won't have to worry about it	3878	B
i don't think i am going to get crocus this spring	3878	B
no i don't think it got cold enough for them to come out	3878	B
we don't have as many wild flowers here as there are down toward Austin i use to go to school in San Marcus so i'm familiar with Austin and the area	3878	B
i think so i think the highways are going to be great	3878	B
i'm ready to travel	3878	B
oh	3878	B
uh-huh i agree that's a	3878	B
uh-huh	3878	B
i agree and it's be probably be wonderful out there	3878	B
well i'm wishing i'm i'm wishing i had made a picnic for my son and i put down a blanket or a a sleeping bag and had a picnic outside	3878	B
yeah that that's what'll be great when all the wild flowers come out take yourself out a picnic and	3878	B
oh really	3878	B
we're not suppose to get it until about Monday Sunday night or Monday	3878	B
well we've uh yeah we have-	3878	B
oh	3878	B
i guess not	3878	B
although they revise they revise our weather report about every other day it changes it seems like but hey have been saying it was going to rain	3878	B
Saturday afternoon but now we are under a big high	3878	B
or high pressure	3878	B
so we're um	3878	B
we're going to be stable for a while they say through Sunday	3878	B
yeah that'd be	3878	B
uh-huh	3878	B

right	3878	A
well the weather man said it's suppose to start raining again for us tomorrow	3878	A
and through the weekend	3878	A
oh maybe it'll might we might not get it here when	3878	A
well they told us it was going to rain today too we don't have the most reliable weather men	3878	A
no they said it was going to rain today	3878	A
yeah	3878	A
yeah	3878	A
yeah	3878	A
oh good	3878	A
maybe we might get some of that it seems like there's a line there at Waco where it'll come to Waco and then go and we won't get it	3878	A
or it'll go up as far as Waco and then move over and Dallas won't get it	3878	A
you know	3878	A
but uh i hope it will be pretty this weekend i- i can't wait cause it's rained oh i know for the last four or five weekends here	3878	A
it's just been miserable and i want to get outside and barbecue	3878	A
that'll be fun	3878	A
but uh	3878	A
yeah i can't wait	3878	A
as Texas El Paso uh they were undefeated until uh Thursday night when they played the University of Utah here in Salt Lake City and uh	3890	A
they were beaten by uh a last minute three point shot	3890	A
and uh so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play uh Brigham Young University tonight	3890	A
and uh i i'm pretty sure uh they really got a good team this year and i think-	3890	A
uh yes they do uh they usually uh they're usually the one or two in the in the WAC conference and they're the only team from Texas	3890	A
uh-huh	3890	A
uh-huh	3890	A
yeah who's doing the who's leading the conference	3890	A
uh i see	3890	A
oh	3890	A
oh oh i see	3890	A
that kind of fouled things up plus maybe	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
right well last year the University of Utah went and uh they had two of their stars uh	3890	A
got hurt the beginning of the season this year and that's why uh uh Texas El Paso is uh is in the University of Utah went to the NC Double A's last year and they- got into the final sixteen i guess but	3890	A
uh UTEP like i say is doing real well and it's it's too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the	3890	A
uh the Longhorns as far as uh being able to play in any of the	3890	A
junior college so it didn't affect their program other than loosing him yeah right that's too bad	3890	A
yeah but	3890	A
oh that's too bad	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
i see	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
good i know uh i was in Montana this last week and i saw the uh	3890	A
huh the women's team from uh Texas was playing uh Penn State	3890	A
and uh Penn State was ranked number eight i believe in the women's basketball and i- i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight uh back to Utah and i uh Texas was leading	3890	A
i don't know how they came out i don't know if you heard or not but uh	3890	A
oh	3890	A
yeah	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
i wish them well	3890	A
that's great	3890	A
i'll say	3890	A
yeah uh that's uh	3890	A
last year the University of Utah that was the best season they'd had and uh the well the the coach had come in this Rick Majerus he'd come in uh he'd only been there a couple years and uh	3890	A
really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the the first uh uh top ten this year until they lost their two of their their star players and uh through injuries	3890	A
and now they are uh they they did beat uh Texas El Paso and uh that was kind of strange i guess Texas El Paso was just weren't weren't uh	3890	A
hitting and uh	3890	A
oh really hum	3890	B
oh my gosh	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
do do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing	3890	B
huh	3890	B
huh	3890	B
huh yeah see we're it's they're actually in the University of Texas system and i don't i don't even know anything about them_1 i'm here in Austin we have uh University- UT Austin	3890	B
right which is which i mean- i just generally go to the University of Texas right and	3890	B
the the Longhorns um	3890	B
and uh	3890	B
actually- actually i don't know right now Longhorns aren't having quite the year that they had hoped um they they had a a star forward that that was disqualified because of	3890	B
of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they uh some supporter gave him a car or something and uh	3890	B
yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they they're they're holding on but it's not it's not going to be a a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
yeah	3890	B
no it it it something had happened outside of that you know and and it happened as as part of his junior college career	3890	B
but no but they pulled him out of the out of the lineup	3890	B
you know and it was something he he reported himself or i mean they it wasn't a and and the NCAA uh immediately suspended him and then	3890	B
and then actually UT on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so	3890	B
yeah but	3890	B
they've been having uh i mean last- last- last year they had a real good team they had every- they had a new coach Tom Penders come in um about i guess about three years ago	3890	B
and and the the program had been in a long a long decline you know for for years they i guess back when Abe Lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition	3890	B
and then it it kind of went downhill for about_1 for a couple of coaches and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but	3890	B
yeah	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
hum	3890	B
i don't know yeah uh the women's program is quite interesting down here the the women's program here in in Austin um	3890	B
actually for a while it was was drawing bigger crowds than the men's program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean they've they've always been in the top	3890	B
top eight in the country um and actually had a couple of years that they haven't been quite as strong but but uh	3890	B
the the Southwestern Conference uh they've been undefeated in the Southwestern- they were no they aren't now but they had been undefeated in the Southwestern Conference for something like a five year streak or something	3890	B
and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or something-	3890	B
and so -that is they've they've that's that's quite a tradition here in in Texas but	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
oh yeah	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
right	3890	B
up to speed yeah	3890	B
had to uh face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
yeah	3860	B
well i've been very fortunate uh my father	3860	B
uh was very careful in laying plans for his uh latter years	3860	B
and he was very concerned that uh mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years	3860	B
deciding where he wanted to be	3860	B
and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm	3860	B
and uh invested in a uh nursing home in Central Virginia	3860	B
and uh moved in there	3860	B
and uh he made that decision on his own and uh he made a good choice he found one that had uh pleasant conditions for for him and mother living together and it had a uh nursing home attached to it	3860	B
and everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because uh they moved into the uh to the retirement home in August	3860	B
and he died in September	3860	B
just just before his uh uh eightieth birthday	3860	B
and uh it was fortunate that uh	3860	B
uh he had made those provisions because at that point uh mother had uh Alzheimer's disease	3860	B
and her mental faculties were going very rapidly	3860	B
and that's that's uh something that's very stressful to handle	3860	B
so uh we were very fortunate in having her in the right spot	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
yeah my uh i have uh an aunt who's in a uh home in Charlotte North Carolina	3860	B
and they they had planned on that for a number of years and actually uh made the payment on the condominium or the apartment uh oh fifteen years before they moved in	3860	B
and uh so when my aunt finally got to the point her eyesight deteriorated and she could no longer drive and it was getting awkward to get to the store for groceries and things like that	3860	B
and uh she moved in it was only about	3860	B
oh it's walking distance to where she lived so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals	3860	B
um it's kind of amazing the disparity that exists between	3860	B
some-	3860	B
well it's a topic that um my husband and i often discuss because	3860	A
um i don't have any grandparents and my mother is deceased so um we think about that often times with my father but there's plenty of other siblings to help out	3860	A
however on my husband's side um he has one sibling who is mentally retarded and um and then his parents and so we wonder you know how we're going to make ends meet once they're gone	3860	A
um	3860	A
you know my mother-in-law constantly says things like well- you know well i wish if one of us goes i wish we'd all go like in a car accident so that nobody would help nobody would have to worry about it but uh	3860	A
um it's a scary issue i think	3860	A
uh-huh	3860	A
um	3860	A
um	3860	A
wow	3860	A
wow wow	3860	A
um	3860	A
yes i know	3860	A
one	3860	A
um i think that's kind of the ideal situation is to have a combination retirement home nursing home and even you know if they need special care	3860	A
um my husband's grandmother is in a nursing home and	3860	A
i don't think they've termed what she has as Alzheimer's but it you know she reverts a lot back to her childhood	3860	A
and she doesn't know who you are often times- often times she does the one thing that she retains as far as her memory is concerned is um hymns	3860	A
you know religious hymns she can sing them um and remember all the verses but when you talk to her she doesn't know who you are but	3860	A
the home that she is in uh it seems like a nice home but there are a lot of people there that are really bad badly off and they have them all combined together	3860	A
and so her roommate um	3860	A
is um a person who entered herself into the home because she has really bad arthritis but mentally she is completely there so you know i don't know about that type of situation where	3860	A
you know you have a mixture but there is a home here in Dallas that um it's a Methodist home	3860	A
um for the elderly and uh	3860	A
they have that kind of situation it seems like what you were talking about with your parents retirement home and a nursing home	3860	A
you know and even a hospital somewhat attached you know for those who need	3860	A
you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if if i had to one of those	3860	A
um	3860	A
that's about	3860	A
oh really	3860	A
um	3860	A
yeah	3860	A
yeah	3844	B
uh	3844	B
uh yes i do uh	3844	B
well unfortunately i have a cholesterol problem and uh i for a long time i did aerobics	3844	B
but a couple of years ago my uh doctor says no don't do aerobics any more ride the stationary bicycle so that that's what i do for thirty minutes a day i average six days a week	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
oh definitely oh definitely uh it's it's boring	3844	B
no no	3844	B
uh and i- i also belong to uh the Texas Club and uh so some days i uh i go over there and i work out with the the Nautilus weights	3844	B
well uh my goal is uh three days a week but usually it boils down to about one day a week	3844	B
uh do you have a regular regimen	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum	3844	B
yeah oh that's wonderful	3844	B
um	3844	B
um	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah that's extremely important	3844	B
um-hum um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
yeah there's a a program on in the afternoons on channel two at four o'clock do you have a VCR	3844	B
uh you might record it and play it later now it's just uh	3844	B
oh stretch and tone it's not aerobics	3844	B
uh but it's called body electric and it's a a lady broadcasting from Florida and uh it's for thirty minutes it comes on uh	3844	B
five days a week and uh it it- it's a really good supplement to your bike riding	3844	B
uh it helps with flexibility and uh	3844	B
for- uh for some of the exercises she uses three pound weights	3844	B
but uh she's not a a a great weight person but uh sometimes for the uh upper arms and deltoids and	3844	B
uh back muscles she uses these three pound weights	3844	B
so	3844	B
uh-huh	3844	B
all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their New Year's resolutions and going out and getting their regular exercise program um do you exercise regularly	3844	A
and tell me about that if you would	3844	A
uh-huh	3844	A
yes	3844	A
wow	3844	A
well that's great that's fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go	3844	A
well good so you're good- you're using it	3844	A
yes because_1 you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike	3844	A
yeah	3844	A
oh	3844	A
okay	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
yes yes	3844	A
well you've got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but it's	3844	A
on all sorts of athletic teams and and regular programs but since i've gotten into a new job and into my uh career	3844	A
and into a young family time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy	3844	A
is that uh i have bicycles and i have two older boys that they like to ride bicycles with me and we ride as a family	3844	A
and you know uh i actually live in Plano but i'm working here in Dallas and they have some excellent bike paths	3844	A
where you can go and ride for miles and miles and days and days and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun	3844	A
and uh one thing that i've been doing also is that	3844	A
mind you it's not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the boys get on their bikes and uh we we	3844	A
they ride along and i jog along and it's a nice time to spend some some time with the boys too so i'm trying to coordinate	3844	A
you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that	3844	A
and uh there there's a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them_1's in soccer and the other one just loves to do it	3844	A
and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that it's very helpful to them also	3844	A
in my oldest boy's soccer league that uh he doesn't seem to run out of breath as much as the other boys do and	3844	A
he can stay in longer	3844	A
and uh	3844	A
and uh so i- i don't have a a regular one but i i really would	3844	A
i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time every day in the morning if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around six or six thirty	3844	A
which means i'd have to get up way early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning to do that and uh i've also tried to set aside time in the afternoon or evening	3844	A
but uh things generally pop up that preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
uh yes i do	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
oh okay	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
well great	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
oh okay	3844	A
well	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
well that's that's good that's one thing that i'd	3844	A
and the weights i'd kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately	3844	A
Mike i'm calling from Dallas from Richardson	3802	A
okay well good	3802	A
you know our subject is on boating and sailing	3802	A
and quite honestly with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating	3802	A
oh do you well great	3802	A
well that's neat	3802	A
right	3802	A
i've seen some nice nice sailboats the guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it	3802	A
right in the uh driveway and it seemed i think it held probably uh it must have slept four people anyway	3802	A
right	3802	A
i i understand	3802	A
i'll tell you it's	3802	A
oh they are and you know we have a swimming pool at our house and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because_1 i know it's a lot of maintenance	3802	A
oh gosh yeah	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
sure	3802	A
you bet i know my wife and i were first married her aunt and uncle uncle- aunt and uncle up in New York they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay	3802	A
and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older	3802	A
Chris Craft and we were involved every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that we just worked all the time but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen	3802	A
it was sort of neat we but i think that was the last time we were really involved in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago it is a lot of fun	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter	3802	A
and he had a place on the Lake of the Ozarks and he had a boat and uh	3802	A
i never seen so many boats in all my life people actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying and- townhouse or condominium whatever they own and they they go boats i mean they go if they wanna go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat	3802	A
and that was sort of neat yeah that's- that's that's true that's exactly how they do it they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants that was sort of a neat setup i enjoyed that we spent a week with them i enjoyed that	3802	A
but i'm envious i'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
think- you think you'd really enjoy it	3802	A
yes	3802	A
oh that's	3802	A
yeah that's great	3802	A
oh i know	3802	A
and putt putt sure well that's neat where do you work who are you with	3802	A
well good	3802	A
oh okay great i'm in Addison here	3802	B
right	3802	B
i do uh quite a bit of sailing i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but	3802	B
i haven't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately since it's i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore so it's hard for me to get it somewhere but	3802	B
yeah this one is not that big it's a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of	3802	B
stuck your body out the whole it back into the main part of the sailboat but	3802	B
but it's there they can be black holes to throw money into	3802	B
boats are kind of expensive to maintain	3802	B
especially a bigger one the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat	3802	B
power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it the sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up but you still have to	3802	B
worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it it takes a a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but	3802	B
well it's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation	3802	B
uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it and- but it's uh	3802	B
use the boat for transportation	3802	B
they just go across the boat and get a and- tie it up and go in huh	3802	B
yeah that would be fun	3802	B
i've just never i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but	3802	B
um once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and uh i- i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh	3802	B
i might do something differently i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them_1 keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh	3802	B
yeah i think i would uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because it's so quiet	3802	B
and if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also	3802	B
where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun	3802	B
or if or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the middle of the lake i've with my little one i've been out there many times on a calm summer day	3802	B
where all of a sudden the wind stops and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and	3802	B
and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that and if you have- if you're have- big enough boat to have the little	3802	B
auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in	3802	B
but it's fun i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh	3802	B
i'm a scout leader though so i'm i'm out with-	3802	B
uh well on a daily basis uh at lunch time i take a brisk walk for twenty minutes along with a friend at work	3896	A
i am uh paying for a lifetime membership with President's Health Spa	3896	A
well i don't i don't get there very often	3896	A
but um i figure one of these days i will	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum well i have an exercise bike um also that's that's in my my house	3896	A
and it just sits there	3896	A
um-hum not doing me very much good	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
well i i'm from New York and i'm a lot more inspired here in Dallas than i was there because_1 there's a lot more uh open space	3896	A
and you just- you just see a lot more people doing it you know outside- outside all of the time	3896	A
and	3896	A
hm	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
speaking of bicycling i saw a uh a video in uh Blockbusters	3896	A
and it was something for you to sit on your bike and look at while you're you're um you're doing your workout have you	3896	A
yeah it's like you're going through hills or something and it's	3896	A
yeah have you have you watched one of those yeah	3896	A
oh wow	3896	A
yeah	3896	A
yeah um i keep saying i'm going to um rent one and maybe i i'll get to to get on my bike and- and use it	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
well they have those steppers in President's although i haven't i haven't used one of them but i do see people on them and they they're supposed to be really really really a great uh workout	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
yeah i've been on the rowing machine at uh President's and uh i i like that	3896	A
well well one thing i find that you know once the first time i joined and went in there they they measured me and weighed- and weighed me and all this stuff and wrote my name down on a little card	3896	A
and they show- take you around they show you all the equipment and then you never see- hear from them again you know you you're really basically on your own	3896	A
you know they tell you how many of these to do and many of those to do and then you- you- you know they never like call you back and say well it's time for us to see how	3896	A
well what kind of exercise do you do	3896	B
okay	3896	B
you're paying for it but not utilizing it too much	3896	B
um	3896	B
yeah i'm not i'm not currently uh enrolled in a athletic club or anything uh	3896	B
i try to get out and do a little bit of running during the week uh when the weather is good or it's a little tough in the winter when it gets dark so early but	3896	B
um uh i try to get out as much as i can	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
sits there and collects dust huh	3896	B
uh i- i lived in Colorado quite a few years and i was more inspired to workout there just because the weather was	3896	B
uh clear more of the time and and i like to stay in better shape to go out and do a lot of skiing and things like that and since i moved to Dallas i guess i haven't been as inspired to get out and do as much	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
yeah i- i find it kind of uh kind of a chore i guess to go uh uh on a regular	3896	B
schedule to work working out inside i'd much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing	3896	B
uh-huh	3896	B
oh is it like a scenery or something	3896	B
no i haven't but i- i have seen some things uh	3896	B
uh advertised in videos like that and i've heard some athletic clubs have	3896	B
uh have machines with a screen like that and that actually the computer	3896	B
uh when- when it shows you're going up a hill it actually makes the bike peddle harder and things like that	3896	B
and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or something like that	3896	B
yeah we bought a uh stepper and uh in the winter time i've tired to use that uh a couple of times a week just because it's so hard to get outside and	3896	B
and and do much in the way of either you- like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it	3896	B
not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there- there is a Y very close i guess i could do that	3896	B
there they they do work you pretty good and	3896	B
um other things i've used that give you pretty good workout uh the rowing machines aren't to bad and	3896	B
one of the best ones although good- for people who aren't used to cross country skiing those Nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people don't like it because they don't feel like they they have good	3896	B
balance i guess it's it it's better if you know how to cross country ski before you use those	3896	B
what's the i've i've heard some other people uh not too happy with President's uh they join and then it seems like that they don't have a lot of good things to say about it	3896	B
oh the-	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
yes i have one Chihuahua that's fourteen years old	3865	B
do you	3865	B
oh uh-huh	3865	B
there's been a time when we had as many as like four pets when our children were growing up and everything you know but they died off one by one and that's it	3865	B
yeah yeah cause they're just they are kind of like a baby you know they're they	3865	B
you have to carry them_1 around you know they can't do a lot	3865	B
right uh but well our cat died two years ago and she was eighteen years old well i am telling you this because you have cats	3865	B
so she lived a long time	3865	B
well kind of both uh	3865	B
she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a little door you know where she could come in	3865	B
but then as she got real old then she went out less and less and then not at all you know the last year or so	3865	B
so uh	3865	B
now what do your cats look like	3865	B
uh-huh	3865	B
oh you have to have his skin i mean his hair-	3865	B
oh	3865	B
oh	3865	B
he doesn't	3865	B
oh my goodness	3865	B
oh yeah i don't think i have ever seen a cat sheared like that	3865	B
oh my i bet	3865	B
do your cats get along well	3865	B
oh now we do a lot uh we our daughters are like in their late twenties and one of them has a Shelty	3865	B
and uh	3865	B
so any time she is traveling or she is working a lot or whatever all kinds of reasons	3865	B
her dog is here a lot you know	3865	B
and uh its a very pretty dog you know looks like a little miniature collie	3865	B
uh-huh that looks just like Lassie except in miniature	3865	B
but uh it is a real pretty little dog but uh i don't know if all of them are that way or not its a real shy dog it really only likes likes my daughter and us you know	3865	B
and uh	3865	B
otherwise it'll go hide	3865	B
yeah well i- yeah now cats it is more usual i think to do that i don't think i have ever known a dog that would this i mean she is so shy that my daughter's roommate	3865	B
yeah yeah they don't uh	3865	B
uh i mean they they know each other and and all that but they i mean they don't play or anything because my my Chihuahua is older she doesn't care any thing about playing and we have promised her that	3865	B
she- we are not going to get any more pets until she is gone she is going to be an only child	3865	B
because every when we got her she was like one of four pets	3865	B
uh	3865	B
right right we had a	3865	B
yeah well of course this one's	3865	B
oh yeah trying to make a long story short we stopped at a service station several months ago and then when we got home i said well you get the dog i will get the baby i had the grandchild in the backseat	3865	B
no dog	3865	B
the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and uh we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and	3865	B
and it took us three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and pictures- with pictures of the dog	3865	B
well somebody looked at the picture on the poster well not poster i made you know xerox copies looked at the picture and said i saw that dog Sunday and he directed me to who	3865	B
-any pets	3865	A
wow	3865	A
i have two cats	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
i bet you're attached to your Chihuahua	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
they're so little and cute	3865	A
yeah they're so little and cute	3865	A
wow yeah eighteen	3865	A
was it an inside or an outside cat	3865	A

uh-huh	3865	A

yeah mine are two characters they're only	3865	A
oh i have one that is a calico and she is not very friendly	3865	A
and i have one that is uh uh yellow and white long hair	3865	A
and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it's the funniest looking thing you have ever seen	3865	A
his fur shaved because he he mats up so bad	3865	A
and he doesn't lick his coat	3865	A
and he gets great big old knots all over him and then when you go pick him up he looks so funny	3865	A
it looks like a cat going out for aerobics	3865	A
cause they don't shave you know their legs	3865	A
no it's real strange	3865	A
they call it a lion cut they shave it all the way to the collar	3865	A
it's really funny he's real friendly he acts like a dog	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
no they don't like each other at all	3865	A
they really don't that is really strange	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
right	3865	A
oh really	3865	A
oh neat	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah well that is what my cats do when company comes they hide	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
shy	3865	A
oh my word that is shy	3865	A
wow	3865	A
does your dog and your daughter's dog get along	3865	A
get in each other's way	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
and now this is her time	3865	A
well those are so cute i just adore them_1	3865	A
do you carry it a lot with you in the car and stuff	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
oh my word	3865	A
how'd you find it	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
so have you remodeled your house recently	3823	B
can you do that yourself or do you have it done	3823	B
and then you put putty around the edges	3823	B
i'm i'm impressed that you did that though	3823	B
we um live in our current house about three years and we've only done minor repairs like painting and we did put a new roof on but previously we had owned a eighty year old house in another city	3823	B
and that's where i got my real experience at repairs and so i've replaced many windows	3823	B
but they had wooden they were wooden windows and um i don't know for some reason it the putty seemed easier or something because_1 it blended in	3823	B
well uh we had a lot of it done i can't claim to have done much of it it had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so that they were all um even tiled- what do you- i forgot what you call that where you skim the top and then revarnish	3823	B
and we had it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done	3823	B
we bought when we bought the house uh most of the walls were covered in fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it once that the previous owners had their furniture out it looked pretty bad so when- then we took down the	3823	B
um fabric to find huge plaster cracks	3823	B
not unexpected i suppose but so we repaired a lot of that and then um we didn't do any real major we moved just a couple walls	3823	B
and we put in new bathroom fixture not- not- we kept the fixtures but we put in like a new we did put in a new bathtub and then we sort of bought the antique looking	3823	B
you know the brass plumbing type thing although it was new	3823	B
i like old houses but it is everyone talks about it it's true small bathrooms and small closets	3823	B
uh-huh	3823	B
and plumbing you have to know a lot about plumbing	3823	B
that's right	3823	B
you know we had we ran into an interesting complication um our house it had fifty six windows	3823	B
so we decided in order- with an exorbitant heat bill we decided one way we would attack that we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the attic a a lot of it because we didn't have very much the problem and we never anticipated it was in the summertime	3823	B
the humidity it it would rise and in the stairwell at the top of the stairwell it literally would um the humidity would condense on the walls so that the walls would sort of sweat and	3823	B
when we had an engineer come out and talk he just said that we had over insulated our house so it quote couldn't breath	3823	B
and so the humidity when it would you know that the the highest point would go up there and then and then would condense and it was it was really a problem	3823	B
well not you could i don't know i'm sure over the long term it would and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the in the paint	3823	B
um we put in the first thing we tried we just put in a fan in that area so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help um	3823	B
we actually took a screen uh door window off one of windows to try and allow a little ventilation in that area and then the truth is it then became	3823	B
cooler weather and then we sold our house and i never i always hope that the owners didn't have the same problem next year it's all those things that you don't necessarily want to tell them i don't know i mean we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything you just	3823	B
we gave it our best shot but it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious and you know it's	3823	B
perhaps we overdid it	3823	B
its prettiest features it had beautiful wood molding high ceilings and it had beautiful cut glass french doors	3823	B
and um i suppose that was it's it's prettiest features but- and the and the floors were beautiful	3823	B
but it much like the Swiss Avenue area in Dallas	3823	B
i don't i only have friends there	3823	B
i don't think i have the energy or the money for those sort of beautiful old homes now	3823	B
that's	3823	B
i haven't done too much uh i mostly get stuck doing repairs like broken- replacing a broken window the neighbor threw a rock through the window with his lawn mower	3823	A
yeah yeah that's all there was to it	3823	A
well the screen still has a hole in it so don't be too impressed	3823	A
oh wow	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
yeah	3823	A
yeah what all did you do to your eighty year old home did you totally remodel it or had	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
oh yeah	3823	A
i'll bet yeah	3823	A
oh no	3823	A
right right	3823	A
oh the	3823	A
oh yeah uh-huh	3823	A
that that's right yes i lived for a while in Ohio and i was so impressed with the old homes there that the big old homes but i know people were constantly remodeling them_1 and fixing them_1 up	3823	A
that's right and those lovely old homes had no insulation whatsoever	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
i'll bet it was did it damage the walls	3823	A
um-hum	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
well you gave it your best shot	3823	A
yeah	3823	A
and overdid it	3823	A
i'll bet that eighty year old house had a lot of pretty moldings	3823	A
oh	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
no i've just recently helped a friend put up crown molding in the in his guest bedroom	3823	A
up around the ceiling of- course it was a ten foot ceiling in there and it was a rather small room to-	3823	A
um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our money's worth	3805	A
yeah did you see Sixty Minutes last night	3805	A
well they did a thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need and uh	3805	A
it's staggering	3805	A
well there are a lot of things that people i think generally	3805	A
well i think it's interesting to look at um	3805	A
where the money goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is	3805	A
that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with	3805	A
and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us	3805	A
i mean and i think it's gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh	3805	A
yeah right that's your- i think that's the only thing that's gonna change it and-	3805	A
our- our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part	3805	A
um i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society uh there's very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off	3805	A
eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyer's uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting	3805	A
which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special	3805	A
focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve	3805	A
that's not a formula for a better society	3805	A
and the government really plays a role in this	3805	A
i mean well- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful interest-	3805	A
you know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not	3805	A
likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting	3805	A
but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair and when they recognize it's their tax money they're gonna do more about it	3805	A
i think- i'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line	3805	A
an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country they expect	3805	A
opening it for one hour that they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls	3805	A
and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to put- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government	3805	A
like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then	3805	A
i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look	3805	A
do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art	3805	A
well that's the good thing about what is happening because_1 i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us more- you know about the problems	3805	A
so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country	3805	A
over a very long period of time	3805	A
um and uh	3805	A
right	3805	A
yeah	3805	A
well you may be right what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a	3805	A
hey listen if i had my way i wouldn't pay my taxes not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things	3805	B
no i did not i was	3805	B
well how does this grab you how does this grab you	3805	B
um this i- i mean i'm i'm a lady but this i heard this on a Christian program and it was	3805	B
uh about the NEA and that's the National Endowment for Arts and they fund	3805	B
they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money	3805	B
and then it just frosts me terribly	3805	B
absolutely	3805	B
i believe that's true yes	3805	B
that's correct	3805	B
heavy involvement from the public	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
yeah heavy involvement from the public	3805	B
yeah	3805	B
absolutely	3805	B
no it is not it's lopsided very much so	3805	B
uh-huh that's right they pull the strings	3805	B
right the yeah	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
i'm sure they will	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
uh-huh	3805	B
yes i understand that but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it	3805	B
oh absolutely	3805	B
right absolutely	3805	B
we only see the tip of the iceberg it's only you know there's so much	3805	B
of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture	3805	B
um what	3849	A
things are you looking for in a car what kind of car would you buy	3849	A
for your next purchase	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
well it's funny because_1 i currently also have a Toyota Tercel	3849	A
um	3849	A
when i first got married my my father gave	3849	A
me and my wife a a	3849	A
a used Toyota um Corolla	3849	A
and we used that until we until it's about run into the ground and then we um bought a used um Toyota Tercel i was still a student at the time and um so	3849	A
um you bought what we could afford	3849	A
and	3849	A
i think definitely um now we would also get a a larger car	3849	A
oh	3849	A
very well	3849	A
um	3849	A
it um	3849	A
did very well i mean	3849	A
uh yeah it was about a hundred and fifty thousand and it may have gone further but um	3849	A
it was very reliable though- for us though	3849	A
um	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
oh that's to be expected i would think	3849	A
hopefully- hopefully it just doesn't happen at a a bad time i mean when you're far away from anything or something	3849	A
uh-huh did you buy it new	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
i see but well sounds like it's been a good deal for you	3849	A
um	3849	A
another thing i may consider the main thing i look for in a car is reliability	3849	A
and	3849	A
um i just go by what my dad says he's a mechanic and i remember growing up and and but he's always- never wanted to spend a lot on a car because_1 i grew up in a fairly large family six kids and we just didn't have a lot of money to spend on cars	3849	A
so um i remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that and think they're the most unreliable cars that ever existed i mean ours broke down all the time luckily my dad was mechanic and he could fix them_1 but i remember	3849	A
he said- he said he would never buy um a foreign car but then in nineteen eighty he bought a used Toyota Corolla	3849	A
and i mean didn't even spend very much money for it i don't think he spent more than five hundred dollars for it but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased	3849	A
and he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time	3849	A
and so um	3849	A
but i don't know my feeling is that American cars to keep up at all are becoming more reliable also so i may consider buying um an American made car	3849	A
my next my next purchase	3849	A
that's true	3849	A
i have a cousin- yeah one of my cousins	3849	A
is trying to tell convince me that um	3849	A
the American made cars are becoming reliable- reliable but	3849	A
uh i'm not i'm not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good	3849	A
um and reliable that that i've i've used	3849	A
oh	3849	A
i'm in Iowa City Iowa very small town and i don't i don't know if there's even uh more than a	3849	A
one or two a month i mean um that's that that's not a big consideration here and i just moved from Utah where i that's where i was going to school before and um	3849	A
also there um there's i've never had that concern	3849	A
um so i'm not really i'm not really sure	3849	A
well right now i have a uh small Toyota Tercel	3849	B
and i think next time i want something just a little bit bigger uh perhaps mid size i really don't don't like the the real big cars	3849	B
i'm thinking about maybe a Volvo	3849	B
you do	3849	B
uh-huh	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
right	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
how did your uh Corolla hold up	3849	B
for real	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
do you remember how many miles you had on it in the at the end	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
my my Tercel now has a hundred and forty six thousand miles on it	3849	B
and i really haven't had any trouble out of it except the alternator went out at about a hundred and twenty six thousand miles i think	3849	B
right	3849	B
right	3849	B
right and um it's really been great i have had no problems with it you know except little little minor things like you know belts and course you know	3849	B
actually i didn't i bought it from um Hertz Rent A Car and it had like twenty six thousand miles on it when i bought it	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
right	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
yeah	3849	B
uh-huh	3849	B
wow	3849	B
right	3849	B
uh	3849	B
wow	3849	B
yeah i'm trying to consider that uh that could do to the plight of General Motors and all of that	3849	B
i'm really trying trying to consider	3849	B
but i don't know i- i- i don't want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs	3849	B
have you heard that uh or do you know anything about the foreign cars being easier to steal than the uh the American cars	3849	B
because_1 there's a lot of of um car theft going going on in Dallas right now i don't know about in your area	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
yeah	3849	B
yes uh we live uh right to the base of the Wasatch Front so uh uh as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever	3895	A
well- well uh sometimes we did most of the time we'd we'd put up tents and we'd go up and stay for a week or	3895	A
uh weekend or go up into uh Yellowstone Park and and camp in the campgrounds up there	3895	A
but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and uh some real good memories how about_1 your experiences on camping uh what have you	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
well that sounds uh	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
oh wow	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
all those fun things huh	3895	A
yes i'll say well we uh when we were up in uh by Yellowstone Park we had uh moose that went through our campground and we had a a bear once that went through uh-huh black bear and then we	3895	A
uh we've seen a lot of rattle snakes uh in our camping trips	3895	A
and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but	3895	A
i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and	3895	A
no no no he we uh didn't bother it and uh everything was fine but uh	3895	A
it's uh camping has really uh been a a great part of our life and now we're we're older all of our kids are gone and we don't uh	3895	A
uh fact last year was the first year i didn't go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and i didn't first time in uh fifty four years that i hadn't gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so	3895	A
but anyway it uh	3895	A
yeah when the grandkids uh get a little bit older then we'll we'll we'll do that again	3895	A
oh uh-huh	3895	A
uh-huh well i would uh it's not like camping in a way but yet it is you're still uh on the	3895	A
right	3895	A
yes uh we got uh where we had a a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we we took up and	3895	A
uh when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did uh pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and uh	3895	A
speaking about_1 tornados up in Yellowstone uh one went through there usually they don't have such things here but	3895	A
it took down pine trees quite a swath and uh we were there right after that happened but uh	3895	A
uh those tornados i guess are uh pretty scary things	3895	A
um-hum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in Yellowstone and it's uh maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but uh and it happened and uh that was	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
oh it is it's it's beautiful we've spent a lot of time up there and that but that's a long ways to pull a trailer	3895	A
yeah	3895	A
no-	3895	A
well do you go camping Glen	3895	B
by camping	3895	B
you you mean really roughing it	3895	B
oh but that was	3895	B
uh well i've our children were growing up also uh we had a boat and we'd	3895	B
go camping on the long weekends uh Memorial Day Fourth of July Labor Day	3895	B
and uh we went with some good friends and we'd get as many you know involved as we could and	3895	B
so our kids really grew up all through uh you might say junior high and high school camping and uh	3895	B
we've really had a good time doing it um we went to a lake called Lake Tawakoni uh it's just kind of east and south of here in Texas	3895	B
and uh	3895	B
we camped outside one time we had a tornado come through our campgrounds it was kind of interesting we had snakes and armadillos and	3895	B
all the fun things that that make memories	3895	B
a bear oh oh	3895	B
oh	3895	B
uh-huh	3895	B
didn't didn't mind you being there a bit huh	3895	B
oh	3895	B
first time huh well	3895	B
maybe you'll get a chance to go again	3895	B
take them well we kind of gave up camping about three four years ago to and we built a lake house	3895	B
and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house	3895	B
well	3895	B
we're we're still outside but we we we figured we're getting a little too old to rough it as much as we used to	3895	B
i didn't know they did yeah	3895	B
oh	3895	B
i guess most- you know there's probably not any part of the country that doesn't experience them every once in a while	3895	B
i bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we we went up we pulled a trailer out there from Illinois um	3895	B
when uh probably about nineteen seventy four i'm trying- no no no no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to Texas	3895	B
and uh we had like a sixteen foot trailer that uh we pulled behind the car	3895	B
and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i- i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer	3895	B
but we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that	3895	B
yeah it was and uh we needless to say we haven't- we haven't done it again pulling the trailer is not the our favorite thing to do	3895	B
so okay so what is the subject now	3872	B
okay well let me tell you about our our situation um we have two girls uh one is twelve one is uh	3872	B
is eleven and i've got uh two sons that are um	3872	B
six and three	3872	B
and uh between the four	3872	B
uh my two girls play a lot of soccer and we travel a lot with them	3872	B
and they're either practicing or playing and and it is really tough to fit everything in	3872	B
and uh you know i'm not real sure what your situation is if you you have any kids that are still at home but	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
oh is that right	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
oh	3872	B
you bet	3872	B
it sure makes a big difference doesn't it	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
it sure is	3872	B
we have uh in fact we- this this past um Christmas	3872	B
we went out to California we- uh both my girls were involved in in tournaments out there so went out there we spent Christmas with uh my wife's family out there in in California and then um	3872	B
we drove out to or down to Southern California and had the tournament we went to Disneyland as a family and and just kind of you know spent time together that way	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
you bet my wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful	3872	B
to be blessed	3872	B
yeah i know that means a you'd mean a lot to uh to Brian he's a he's a heck of a nice guy boy- i really enjoy uh being friends with him he's	3872	B
is that right	3872	B
when did he find time to learn how to do brakes he just helped me do my brakes	3872	B
yeah he is	3872	B
yes	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
well that's great yeah um my work uh uh fortunately my work doesn't take me away from from this area so	3872	B
i have uh i have some time i own my own business out here so i have some time just just spent with them you know whenever the time uh whenever they need me but um	3872	B
i- i know that there's quite a few people in our family that uh or in our you know in our area that um	3872	B
that work outside and and they have a even tougher time trying to uh schedule time with their families	3872	B
okay i'm i'm not sure if our time's up or my phone just went out of out of whack i think that was just my phone	3872	B
well they'll come back on and tell us when the time is up yeah it they should be another couple of minutes so	3872	B
uh-huh oh yeah	3872	B
well i think that's it that's probably more important than anything else and-	3872	B
it's on the the time that we spend with our children	3872	A
okay	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
uh we just uh well we have the one that uh has left	3872	A
but he was here a year ago and uh he was involved in wrestling- wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is uh	3872	A
he's a doctor and he was uh All State in wrestling	3872	A
and then uh my last son that just left home is All State in wrestling so we had two in our family but we had a lot of participation with them_1 and i know what you're talking about where you it's difficult to find time but i	3872	A
i- i feel it's very important that you support the kids as much as you can you and uh uh the spouse because uh when uh well both sons uh when they were wrestling uh they would kind of look up	3872	A
to see if we were in the audience and the that's the last they pay any attention to us -until after the game is over right and the wrestling match	3872	A
and uh we really enjoyed it uh to be involved with our our uh children and i think it's very important that's something that	3872	A
the parents today and- and- and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with with church and everything else that you're doing	3872	A
but uh that's where a family relationship is really built and uh it's uh then they have	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
uh-huh	3872	A
well super	3872	A
well those are things that they'll they'll never forget and uh they know they're loved when when that takes place	3872	A
and that you're supporting them there are so many families that i know about today that they just don't take uh time to do anything with their children	3872	A
oh good good well we're gonna try to get down to uh hopefully for his uh uh the oldest one's uh	3872	A
baptism and then the grandson's uh our youngest to get his uh to the blessing but i don't know whether we can make it or not we're gonna give it a shot but that's coming up	3872	A
i appreciate that he was a super son and when he was wrestling uh we had two sons wrestling and we one week we went to twelve wrestling matches in one week	3872	A
oh he he's very talented in all kinds of things uh he's not like his dad he can do about anything and uh we really miss him being in in Texas	3872	A
so anyway	3872	A
um-hum well that's super	3872	A
um-hum yep well be sure and tell Brian hello and it's been a pleasure talking to you sounds like our time's up and uh give him the the best from him his dad	3872	A
oh oh i see okay	3872	A
i've i've this the first call so i don't know what happens when the time's up	3872	A
oh i see okay fine	3872	A
and course church involvement i think is very important too uh that with parents uh supporting their children in in taking them to Church and going with them_1	3872	A
and that's- that's another activity that uh time is spent and	3872	A
yes i'm still here	3861	A
well that	3861	A
no i think i think it's on i'm i'm so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work the other day people are wondering how to choose a college	3861	A
and i was wondering how what did your parents do to help you choose a college	3861	A
oh	3861	A
oh yeah	3861	A
oh	3861	A
hum	3861	A
so you got to choose a college twice	3861	A
good grief	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
um	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
that was the same way in in my family of course my parents were divorced so it was just mother and my grandparents	3861	A
but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do	3861	A
and i got a a co-op	3861	A
deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out	3861	A
New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology	3861	A
and that choice	3861	A
yeah it was but men out women numbered the women about twenty or thirty to one	3861	A
but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available	3861	A
and it	3861	A
yeah yeah	3861	A
but then i	3861	A
my next choice in college was hey i move back with- home with mom and i i went to the local university to get my grade point back up	3861	A
so a decent school would let me in	3861	A
uh oh	3861	B
are you still there	3861	B
oh i know what it was the answering machine must have run out of	3861	B
i i heard something click and i was like oh no it disconnected us	3861	B
uh-huh	3861	B
well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said	3861	B
um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know Dad said well you know you're a smart kid so	3861	B
you're going to college and you're going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know	3861	B
the different professions and i was kind of like i didn't even know you know	3861	B
i had no clues so i said dad-	3861	B
well i can't stand the sight of blood so a doctor is out and uh i'm not i can't do math so a lot of stuff is out um	3861	B
i didn't think i'd be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a lawyer because i think they help people	3861	B
boy was i stupid	3861	B
so Dad said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer	3861	B
so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff my dad kind of said well uh what's the best law school in the country	3861	B
and all his friends told him Harvard and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too	3861	B
so i was like okay fine	3861	B
so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it	3861	B
you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through Radcliff because	3861	B
used to Harvard was for the boys and Radcliff was for the girls	3861	B
and even though they were combined	3861	B
you know even though they had to let women in Harvard you still had to apply through Radcliff so	3861	B
i did all this and uh a Radcliff alum here in Dallas did my interview and basically Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system	3861	B
and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know	3861	B
wasp type person so i'm not really	3861	B
you know they had this minority recruitment thing	3861	B
so and sure enough about two weeks before school started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl	3861	B
and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start the next day so	3861	B
University of Texas was where my dad went to school and luckily it's kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes the day after i registered	3861	B
yeah by myself	3861	B
i mean my parents didn't really you know my dad was the first	3861	B
well my mom	3861	B
they were the first people in their families that had been to college	3861	B
which i know like people from the east coast	3861	B
colleges are all around you you know	3861	B
and so everybody goes to college or it's more normal i think because_1 a lot of my friends that are from the east coast you know everybody in their family's been to college but out here you know in fact my mother hasn't really been to college college they had a junior college	3861	B
that was fairly close by and and so she that's all she ever did was go to junior college	3861	B
just you know two year college and and got her degree but you know then my dad went back to school and finished school and went to professional school	3861	B
but that was after my brother and i were already little kids so nobody in my family really knew how to advise me	3861	B
oh yeah	3861	B
well where did you go to school in New Mexico	3861	B
i bet that was neat	3861	B
wow	3861	B
yeah	3861	B
that is really critical these days i think	3861	B
oh yeah	3861	B
yeah yeah that's about all i get a chance for between that and um uh Bible study as often as i can that's about the bulk of it	3846	A
not a whole lot of chances otherwise	3846	A
okay um officially a junior right now um	3846	A
well right now i'm taking a a uh my fourth semester of of electronics dealing mostly with uh uh MOSFET and JFET transistors	3846	A
and	3846	A
well okay they they're are gonna uh computer engineering	3846	A
okay i am getting some programming- right right now i'm taking my first semester in in	3846	A
yeah yeah well with this- well they classify it as computer engineering technology so i'm getting a fair amount of programming as well as electronics	3846	A
uh it depends on which language they're working with um	3846	A
right now i'm taking C i've got three semesters in Pascal behind me	3846	A
uh that we're working with what what they called standard uh ANSI C	3846	A
um i'm not real sure what the difference is gonna be between C and C	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
um-hum	3846	A
okay well what we're working with is	3846	A
uh i don't remember the author's name	3846	A
used to be i read a good deal of uh science fiction	3846	A
um Asimov um Clark uh	3846	A
there's uh	3846	A
the big one was Asimov his he's his stuff was easiest to find	3846	A
what got me started in the first place was uh my brother-in-law gave me a set the uh um Foundation Trilogy	3846	A
back junior a year and- a when i -was a in- in junior high school he gave it to me	3846	A
oh yeah and he's come up with what three more books	3846	A
uh parts of it i got three parts of it	3846	A
yeah yeah wait a minute matter of fact i did read i- i Robot	3846	A
I Robot yeah that's pretty light reading for science fiction those kind of things	3846	A
yes he does- well the uh Foundation Trilogy is directly connected to I Robot	3846	A
as a matter of fact his last book Foundation and Earth	3846	A
they made the finally made the connection	3846	A
that uh	3846	A
um leader robot whatever his i don't remember his name now	3846	A
anyway he's still going in the Foundation- at the uh in Foundation and Earth they meet up with him	3846	A
he's on a base on the moon and somehow or another earth has been so utterly polluted with uh uh uh radioactive fallout that it's utterly inhabitable- uninhabitable even though it's been several million years	3846	A
uh several hundred thousand years anyway	3846	A
so it's- it's utterly uninhabitable	3846	A
oh yeah	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
yeah yeah well i- i got started on student late	3846	A
i was thirty three when i started to college for the first time	3846	A
oh yeah yeah i'd i'd been an auto mechanic for twenty years	3846	A
started about twelve years old for my father but uh decided you know i- i had a pretty good idea that wasn't what i wanted to do any more	3846	A
no didn't go through military um	3846	A
uh	3846	A
uh not familiar with it	3846	A
i assume most of the books you're reading these days since you're a student have to do with studies	3846	B
the uh	3846	B
what year are you in in computer science	3846	B
yeah and so the course work you're doing is what	3846	B
i thought you said computer science was your major	3846	B
oh computer engineering okay that's yeah okay	3846	B
well	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
um-hum	3846	B
right so who's books do you use for programming	3846	B
well tell me what language we're taking these days	3846	B
taking C okay is that just standard C or C plus plus	3846	B
yes right um-hum	3846	B
well C plus plus is object oriented and there is uh quite a bit of difference and it quite- often has- you need a book up front to tell you about uh precompiling and that sort of thing and then it normally does a little shuffle up front	3846	B
and then runs on ANSI C or some other similar dialect of C so it does uh some preprocessing to begin with who's book do you use in Pascal	3846	B
so Isaac Asimov for example	3846	B
yeah Arthur Clark	3846	B
yeah yeah	3846	B
oh yeah that's fantastic	3846	B
oh yeah it's hard to put down those	3846	B
have you ever read Asimov's I Robot	3846	B
i have actually gone back and is- is long enough that was the first science fiction book i ever read was I Robot	3846	B
and it	3846	B
and it was so good i went back and read it again because_1 Asimov knows how to string things together you know	3846	B
yeah oh yeah right	3846	B
um-hum um-hum	3846	B
uh	3846	B
i can't remember the name either but	3846	B
uh	3846	B
huh	3846	B
i'll be darned	3846	B
right	3846	B
oh yeah	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
well while i was working i got enough i read on the job a lot of course just like a student does because_1 you're learning all the time in research so i read-	3846	B
i uh	3846	B
started uh long enough ago that uh vacuum tubes were still in business when i was a young engineer you know so i had to continually upgrade my education and	3846	B
yeah so you knew what you wanted to do yeah yeah	3846	B
right	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
have you been in the military at all	3846	B
oh	3846	B
so probably- so probably the things that i enjoy reading relative to military you would enjoy The Web Web Griffin stuff uh which uh has to do with the military and other right wing things-	3846	B
well we have Bermuda grass here do you have that there	3812	B
it's a kind of grass that dies in the winter time	3812	B
do you live in an apartment or a house	3812	B
so you probably don't do any lawn care	3812	B
and fertilize and such but we ran in some into some money trouble so we do all of that ourselves now does the grass die there in Iowa in the winter time	3812	B
is everything brown	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
so right now we do nothing because_1 it's brown and it doesn't grow until	3812	B
later on in the spring	3812	B
but	3812	B
no huh-uh it just goes dormant and then it starts it's you know it rejuvenates itself in the springtime there are people that uh	3812	B
that reseed in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like that i can't remember exactly what it's called	3812	B
and so it's green in the winter but you have to seed over all of this other stuff that's	3812	B
there and it's kind of hard to grow it's kind of foolish as far as i'm concerned	3812	B
so did you grow up in Iowa	3812	B
oh	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff	3812	B
huh	3812	B
huh	3812	B
huh	3812	B
we have a garden here but in Texas it's really hard to grow a garden because it's so	3812	B
hot and the sun is so intense that you know the	3812	B
to have a garden here	3812	B
did you enjoy it did you like to do it when you were there	3812	B
huh	3812	B
yeah you had a compost pile huh	3812	B
how many how many were in your family	3812	B
was it something that the kids mostly took care of	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
what was your favorite thing	3812	B
to eat	3812	B
uh-huh	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
you'd think so	3812	B
so what took you to Iowa	3812	B
uh-huh	3812	B
where did you graduate	3812	B
i knew it i'm a member too that's why i was when you were talking about your garden and everything and your mom canning i thought this guy's got to be got to have roots there somewhere	3812	B
no i grew up in California	3812	B
no it was more in the city but we did have a um a little garden out in the back because_1 anything grows there you just stick it in the ground and it it grows	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah do you have in- in your apartment-	3812	B
so Cathy what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work	3812	A
um i don't know exactly what that is	3812	A
um i don't	3812	A
yeah i live in an apartment	3812	A
yeah that's that's actually correct	3812	A
um it turns brown yeah	3812	A
guess it freezes and everything so	3812	A
so does that mean you have to replant each year or	3812	A
i see	3812	A
no i'm actually from uh	3812	A
uh the Seattle area we lived outside outside of the city- in the country and uh we have five acres of land up against a hillside where i grew up and so we did have a garden about a one a half acre garden pretty big size	3812	A
and grew standard things like corn beans and we had some trees apple trees fruit trees you know and apple trees and	3812	A
oh yeah	3812	A
did lots of canning and	3812	A
we even	3812	A
made an annual trip out to eastern Washington	3812	A
Yakima area to get uh	3812	A
peaches and things like that to can in addition to the the fruit we got out of our own garden	3812	A
uh-huh	3812	A
oh yeah i enjoyed um	3812	A
working in the garden	3812	A
um	3812	A
my dad was a big um	3812	A
fan of organic gardening	3812	A
and so when we um did our garbage and stuff we separated all the banana peels and egg shells and stuff that	3812	A
yeah	3812	A
yeah and	3812	A
always picked a different place in the garden to dump it out	3812	A
had our own rototiller and	3812	A
rough even though it was a large plot we used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was quite a bit of work for all of us but we five kids and	3812	A
uh	3812	A
six kids altogether	3812	A
actually dad did more than his share but uh we always had our our assignments to help out	3812	A
so and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the canning and other things	3812	A
um oh to eat oh um	3812	A
the our big crops were were	3812	A
green beans and corn and i guess i liked the corn	3812	A
and so now that i'm in Iowa i should be get be able to get lots of uh	3812	A
corn on the cob huh	3812	A
uh	3812	A
i just graduated-	3812	A
i	3812	A
i'm working at the University of Iowa	3812	A
um on a post doctoral fellowship i just graduated	3812	A
out west with a PhD in physics	3812	A
uh Brigham Young University	3812	A
uh	3812	A
uh	3812	A
yes and uh	3812	A
so are you originally from Texas	3812	A
i see	3812	A
did- did your family have a farm or were you more in the city	3812	A
uh-huh	3812	A
oh yeah	3812	A
yeah my wife is from southern California and their family has a an orange tree and a lemon tree out back	3812	A
and they grow a few things they tried- tomatoes and stuff but not they don't have very you know just a small- small backyard so there's not too much else they could do there	3812	A
okay	3820	B
oh boy you're a real world traveler here	3820	B
all right	3820	B
oh yeah um emperor or yeah	3820	B
yeah that was a	3820	B
well my wife and i are right now saving for a trip to to England	3820	B
we would like to stay about a month uh	3820	B
well we do have some friends that we can stay at their place for a while or as long as we want actually but it's you know it's in the southern part so but we want us to go all over the countryside	3820	B
that's our next big vacation we've got planned and just a few days in the London itself is all we're interested in there	3820	B
but mostly to this date uh our vacations have been more like uh anywhere where there's not too many tourists	3820	B
i hate resorts	3820	B
and things like that i like to go where you can get out by yourself in the mountains done a lot of camping in New Mexico and uh Colorado	3820	B
and one time we even toured Iowa my wife is from Iowa	3820	B
but actually the southern part and uh she'd never really seen a lot of the different northern places and just the lot of the little towns and so we drove around went to the Humana Colonies things like that	3820	B
we really i think she enjoyed it a a lot because she knew more of the history than course than i did of Iowa but	3820	B
it was uh it was interesting	3820	B
here in Texas we live in the middle of Texas it's hard to get out of Texas on a driving trip	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
right we had- had a we went to Mexico City once by ourselves	3820	B
uh mainly because it was just something we could afford to do and	3820	B
we heard it was interesting well we just had a real awful time because we didn't speak Spanish i don't think that would have helped us any anyway	3820	B
it was just a miserable vacation and we decided you know we'll never go anywhere where they don't speak English or somebody that can't help us	3820	B
it was by the end of that week we felt like everybody was out to get us	3820	B
and that sort of thing and we weren't having the fun we thought we would	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
our last	3820	B
major vacation was uh well we had to go to Iowa to see some relatives because sickness in the family so we took that in for a few days and then we went to a uh	3820	B
to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky	3820	B
and uh it's a it's been rebuilt and we stayed there for three days and it was just kind of neat because we really like Shaker things and we were able to take our dog with us and he stayed with us and	3820	B
it was just the thrill of our life to it was early fall and Kentucky was beautiful that time of the year anyway	3820	B
um	3820	A
what have been some well i'll start out with some of my my vacations um	3820	A
um when i graduated from high school um my uh band my jazz band and we visited Europe i visited Germany and Austria um Italy	3820	A
uh Switzerland	3820	A
and that was pretty fun i also have visited South America	3820	A
and just this last summer one of my favorite vacations is i went to China	3820	A
so uh i i we my wife and i when we went to China we visited the Great Wall and uh the Forbidden City	3820	A
um	3820	A
the Forbidden City is uh right there Tiananmen Square is right in front of it and so that's where all the	3820	A
killings occurred not too long- couple years ago and uh also the Forbidden City if you saw what was that one movie that was really famous	3820	A
uh	3820	A
The Last Emperor yeah that was filmed in the Forbidden City so we had to see that when we went anyway	3820	A
oh that sounds fun	3820	A
you'll need to save for that unless you have some friends there you're going to stay with because_1	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
uh-huh yeah they're not too far from here	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
yeah got to go a long ways uh yeah we also don't like to particularly go to tourist spots fact we usually choose to go places where	3820	A
we at least for part of our trip will be visiting someone and uh even when my wife is well	3820	A
and my graduate program that i was in we knew some people who were in Beijing	3820	A
and so uh	3820	A
we were able to stay with them for part of the time in fact they spoke English very well and and helped us around to see some of the places	3820	A
and even when we went to South America uh	3820	A
uh	3820	A
we knew- there were people contacts we had there	3820	A
so	3820	A
uh	3820	A
but most people that i that i uh met you know at the university and so uh	3820	A
it makes a big difference to us we like to go for go on a trip with someone who's from the area because i don't know i've i'm afraid especially if i don't know the language	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
yeah	3820	A
it really makes a difference because i know even when we went to China when we crossed the border we went over to Hong Kong we were so relieved it was so fun to be uh	3820	A
you know it seemed like returning to civilization and where a lot of people spoke English and uh just the general living conditions were were somewhat higher also so it was uh	3820	A
yeah	3804	B
yeah well i've had them_1 uh where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people um and i had help with them_1 um and	3804	B
part of them_1 i did were like a buffet and uh it i had uh	3804	B
just different uh side dishes and appetizers and one of them_1 that that i'd remembered was uh	3804	B
some uh sausage hors d'oeuvres and uh	3804	B
anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh	3804	B
cups of Bisquick and uh	3804	B
sausage oh like a a Owens mild you can i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to yeah and uh you	3804	B
put that in and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and	3804	B
make- make it all doughy and then like i just put them_1 in little balls and bake them_1 for about fifteen minutes and they are so good	3804	B
yeah it's making me hungry for them_1 right now	3804	B
have you yeah	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
i i've used that quite a bit and it and it seems to work real well um and uh um	3804	B
when i've had so many people uh to- to feed like i'd try to do a ham	3804	B
an a turkey and and	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
um-hum	3804	B
no what	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
oh i'll bet	3804	B
yeah i'll have to try that	3804	B
i like things that are easy and and uh	3804	B
nutritious	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
i know i know well thank God for microwaves you know	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
um-hum um-hum	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
right well i don't anymore yeah it's been a few years and and uh	3804	B
i don't have you know over a couple either and and uh i try to	3804	B
uh have everything all ready and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where i don't spend- spend all my time in the kitchen	3804	B
and uh spaghetti and	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
oh yeah	3804	B
i like it too	3804	B
i do too	3804	B
um-hum	3804	B
yeah well have you had any good ideas yet oh okay	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
and that's the way to do it too	3804	B
i think it's you know what's i think is so nice is that	3804	B
in this day and time that we can have good food	3804	B
that's good for you and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen and and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it	3804	B
well	3804	B
okay Cindy you there	3804	A
okay what kind of dinner parties have you had	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
uh-huh	3804	A
uh-huh	3804	A
whatever you like huh yeah	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
hm	3804	A
oh that sounds delicious yeah	3804	A
yeah you know i've made like little Swedish meatballs but they're just made out of the beef you know	3804	A
and uh with spices and things in them_1 but never anything mixed with Bisquick	3804	A
um-hum hm	3804	A
yeah that's my that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time	3804	A
you know i've uh i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here	3804	A
uh which i had uh things like that but i always cooked them_1 ahead of time and then i just sliced them	3804	A
you know and had macaroni salad with uh shrimp in it have you ever had that	3804	A
get some fresh little fresh shrimp and it's in your macaroni salad that you make	3804	A
the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor	3804	A
yeah i don't like the can but the fresh you know	3804	A
yeah that was really good	3804	A
yeah right right but uh at uh Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know	3804	A
which is kind of hard because you got so many people and then by time you pass everything around it seems like everything on your plate's cold	3804	A
so but anyhow i	3804	A
yeah you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know	3804	A
but uh other than that i- i don't have too- too many parties uh you know i have like maybe just a couple- another couple over for dinner	3804	A
but uh other than than than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of people like except except at Christmas and i have my family	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
yeah right right	3804	A
yeah that's easy i always like to have that too you know everybody seems to like that too	3804	A
no everybody likes that	3804	A
and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast that's what i love	3804	A
with my	3804	A
and um other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what goes- next weekend when the Super Bowl's on	3804	A
i've asked a couple people to come over and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that	3804	A
no not yet no and i you know i don't want to have to come away from the TV i want something that i can just take them_1 and serve them_1 while they're sitting in front of the TV	3804	A
you know so i'll think of something just that- that we can munch on over there you know	3804	A
and they can just fill- fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down	3804	A
yeah yeah	3804	A
yeah preparing it right	3804	A
oh it sure does	3804	A
well when i was brought up you know we didn't	3804	A
hello	3807	A
how you doing	3807	A
hi Holly uh my name's Lee i'm calling from uh Plano Texas	3807	A
oh okay	3807	A
well i guess we're supposed to talk about	3807	A
oh it's been beautiful today yeah	3807	A
snow no not over here	3807	A
just a little bit north of us though yeah just a little bit north of- it's been beautiful today probably uh high fifties- fifties low fourties- maybe you know low sixties	3807	A
oh it's beautiful how about_1 there	3807	A
oh good good you've had enough uh water for a while	3807	A
well uh	3807	A
yeah we better let me push one here	3807	A
okay	3807	A
what's that	3807	A
let's see i've got four kids and they uh our TVs are usually	3807	A
are usually yeah uh ruled by the kids so we watch all the usuals uh Cosby you know Cosby Kids and	3807	A
uh we yeah we like to watch comedy	3807	A
um uh we uh our kids are so involved in sports and stuff that our nights are not- we're not home	3807	A
very much at night so	3807	A
um what are yours	3807	A
oh is that right	3807	A
yeah- oh isn't that a great show that is the funniest show	3807	A
oh that is the funniest show	3807	A
um	3807	A
yeah	3807	A
uh-huh	3807	A
now they've got one tonight with Susan Day	3807	A
yeah that that looks intriguing it looks kind of it would be	3807	A
well	3807	A
we- we we've got uh enough TVs that that whoever wants to you know watch uh if whatever- yeah the majority stays in the front room and watches and whoever wants to watch something else can go somewhere else and watch it so	3807	A
uh yeah i think my wife and i are probably gonna just stick in our room and and watch that one	3807	A
it looks it- it looks intriguing to me so but uh	3807	A
yeah how about_1 during the day do you do you watch any of the soaps or you watch any of the talk shows	3807	A
you work okay	3807	A
uh-huh	3807	A
yeah	3807	A
the old shows	3807	A
oh yeah oh yeah yeah	3807	A
you know i was watching um i took the day off today and i was watching uh Donahue and he had uh	3807	A
past child stars	3807	A
yes uh he had uh Danny Bonaducci from uh The Partridge Family he had uh uh Jay North from- uh you know Dennis the Menace	3807	A
and he had Spanky McFarland	3807	A
and he had uh you know three or four others uh and they were talking about uh child stars and how they were mistreated as you know when they were growing up and uh	3807	A
yeah and they were talking about this uh Macaulay kid you know from Home Alone	3807	A
uh and they asked a real interesting question you know that- what if the kid	3807	A
you know all of a sudden said well i don't want to do this anymore	3807	A
you know and i guess his dad is the uh is also his agent	3807	A
yeah but- you know i mean if i- i guess i'm i- i kind of put myself in in his dad's shoes if if my kid was making	3807	A
you know twenty five million dollars a year and he came to me and said i don't want to do this anymore i mean what do you do what do you say you know	3807	A
yeah that's right so he- -he -he	3807	A
yeah so uh	3807	A
it i wouldn't think so you know i guess yeah i'm kind of sympathetic to the to the young kids that are involved in that and	3807	A
and uh but as far as shows uh you know my kids like to watch all the cartoons on Saturdays	3807	A
yeah	3807	A
yeah yeah uh	3807	A

yeah	3807	B
okay_1	3838	A
oh well actually i'm from California and before then i was from Utah so	3838	A
well i grew up in California and then i went to school in Utah and i got married there and we stayed there for a while and then now we're in Utah- Iowa	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
oh	3838	A
um	3838	A
well i crochet and i do water color and i um sew and i do fabric painting	3838	A
um i've done some cross stitching	3838	A
i haven't tried any needlepoint yet how about_1 you	3838	A
oh right	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
uh-huh	3838	A
oh God	3838	A
oh yeah well those take a lot of time i only can do things that are pretty fast because	3838	A
we just um got our baby last year and i just	3838	A
don't have the patience to just- you know be some uh-huh	3838	A
um	3838	A
um	3838	A
um our baby's quilt it was a pre	3838	A
like the design i just went around the design in the quilt i didn't piece it or anything like that	3838	A
but uh	3838	A
uh-huh and just-	3838	A
um	3838	A
i put it on the frame the quilting frame	3838	A
have you are you familiar with that yeah okay	3838	A
oh my God	3838	A
well i haven't done tons of them_1	3838	A
but um i used to do more before um	3838	A
before i had before we got our baby but	3838	A
uh-huh	3838	A
yeah exactly	3838	A
well one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just	3838	A
make a T-shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make	3838	A
um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with	3838	A
Heat and Bond or whatever and then paint around it and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first	3838	A
and then i paint around it so you can't see the stitching as much	3838	A
does- does that make sense to you	3838	A
so	3838	A
oh	3838	A
oh sure uh-huh	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
oh	3838	A
well	3838	A
yeah someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways and i've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even	3838	A
even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps	3838	A
and um	3838	A
well if you're from Iowa you must be very artsy-craftsy everyone i've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands	3838	B
i didn't know anyone ever moved from California to Kansas- Iowa	3838	B
i'm teasing only because i'm from Indiana i really liked i like the Midwest	3838	B
but i married a Texan and they have a way of dragging you back home	3838	B
anyway we're supposed to be talking about crafts do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands like knitting or	3838	B
oh you do a lot then do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching	3838	B
um actually i i'm pretty untalented i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um	3838	B
but i- i don't know somehow i- i don't have the time anymore	3838	B
but i have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their um bags some their most recent uh needle craft	3838	B
and in December everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings	3838	B
yes	3838	B
is this your first baby have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets	3838	B
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself or	3838	B
how- how did you make a quilt	3838	B
uh-huh	3838	B
but you actually hand quilted it yourself	3838	B
did did you need a loom or were you able- was it small enough that you could just hold it	3838	B
uh-huh	3838	B
but um	3838	B
my again my mother back in Indiana we had a quilting frame in our basement and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself	3838	B
um yes which i was always amazed i have one of them_1 um but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work	3838	B
have you think children you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children	3838	B
i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and	3838	B
are are wonderful and and they'll wear them_1 once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear your	3838	B
oh yes i think it's very clever it's uh funny that you said that for Christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful Christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely	3838	B
but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it so i had- i went and bought just some	3838	B
cloth glue and glued it all back and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable and i	3838	B
but it's so i'm familiar with that but i think you're very clever to um sew around the edges i think gluing alone	3838	B
certainly would if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges	3838	B
uh yeah something about the school system here	3841	B
well then i'll uh i'll walk softly	3841	B
yeah	3841	B
what school system does she teach in	3841	B
oh wow	3841	B
well i think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than uh	3841	B
than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program	3841	B
um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school	3841	B
because they've taken it the best teachers and the best students they've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district	3841	B
and uh put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult but once you're in uh they have they have self-paced programs	3841	B
and so you have students that wanna learn and uh you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically uh	3841	B
there's probably some discrimination if you wanna say that uh because most of the people that are in the academy system	3841	B
uh are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system	3841	B
and most of that's not all true but i'm saying a large percentage of them_1 are and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does	3841	B
and so there's i think that uh that's my justification for saying that	3841	B
the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it	3841	B
don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you	3841	B
yeah	3841	B
yeah i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the South Dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education	3841	B
level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed	3841	B
and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education	3841	B
uh including uh	3841	B
exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do	3841	B
uh database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can't function	3841	B
you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you	3841	B
unless you have the education and then education- and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself	3841	B
our topic today	3841	A
right and now i'm sort of don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage my wife's a school teacher so	3841	A
no you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too my wife teaches seventh grade	3841	A
and you know	3841	A
there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but uh	3841	A
for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs and course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even even in the seventh grade	3841	A
Plano School System but but to give you an example uh	3841	A
you know one of her kids will come in and he's	3841	A
you could tell he's just bombed out on drugs and uh she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it	3841	A
you're not allowed to send them_1 home you know if you do that then	3841	A
your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and just it's it's a numbers game i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and	3841	A
preventing other kids from learning	3841	A
yes	3841	A
sure	3841	A
sure	3841	A
oh yeah my son had such a tough time in uh	3841	A
the school he went to but there was through it wasn't all the school's fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in Richardson and that that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was	3841	A
but uh had to be done at least it	3841	A
took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something	3841	A
but i'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today	3841	A
yeah i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate	3841	A
you bet	3841	A
you bet	3841	A
well- it's different-	3841	A
sure well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just	3841	A
are always fighting the system i don't know if it's better than any you know we came down to Texas from the uh New York area we were only there for a short time but my wife is from New York and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and	3841	A
i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from and they they i don't know if they learn more but they certainly uh	3841	A
they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities	3841	A
so you have a child	3811	A
two years old in child care right now	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
uh	3811	A
yes our first and he just turned three months	3811	A
so we're just starting into hunting for child care right now both of us are students	3811	A
uh uh University of Southern Mississippi	3811	A
um	3811	A
she's	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
uh probably um	3811	A
actually spring semester a year from now he's gonna have to be in child care for- uh five days a week	3811	A
more than likely uh depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing her internship that semester it'll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing	3811	A
so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four six- anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point right now we're trying to avoid it but we just	3811	A
a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him uh i get out of class at	3811	A
certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class	3811	A
you- know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home so for about_1 twenty minutes- twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
uh that makes a big difference	3811	A
yes	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists	3811	A
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university's uh uh department of um uh well- their Home Economics- Department	3811	A
um they uh they have a subbranch uh American Family Counseling and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus	3811	A
but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list so uh	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
well- it's best	3811	A
yeah a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yes	3811	A
it's amazing how much good things like uh Sesame Street will do	3811	A
is uh	3811	A
yeah we have a	3811	B
two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh	3811	B
pretty reasonable price we think	3811	B
how about you do you have any children	3811	B
oh boy	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
are you where are you student	3811	B
no kidding	3811	B
i was a professor in a university here in California for a while	3811	B
yeah uh are you gonna uh put your son in child care in a a year or two	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
uh-huh	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
well that's a good experience i think and uh there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to	3811	B
uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found	3811	B
um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh that's more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier	3811	B
um facility um she goes to a home this is a um	3811	B
a couple uh emigrated from China early in in their lives they've been here probably thirty forty years they've got three daughters	3811	B
um and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them_1 in the afternoon	3811	B
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience i think- if it's good i think it's very good for the child	3811	B
and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year	3811	B
but um we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh	3811	B
just uh	3811	B
choose in the marketplace i don't know what it's like around uh Hattiesburg	3811	B
uh-huh	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
i'll bet they're involved	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah well that's uh i know it's it's a real uh hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities out here at Stanford they have a	3811	B
you know a a a real good facility and there uh is is quite a waiting list to get into that so it's uh	3811	B
you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and i think that it it really is buyer beware	3811	B
well it is the best way to do it interestingly i think that um my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that um	3811	B
private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn because i think what we're gonna go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that	3811	B
uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh	3811	B
pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for	3811	B
uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life	3811	B
it's it's phenomenal it's phenomenal the the programming	3811	B
the human operating system is my area-	3811	B
well uh as a former uh professor in a university and having been through college uh	3840	B
and graduate school myself i guess my own um	3840	B
advice would be to first try to assess the needs of the	3840	B
the kid um some kids do very well in large universities	3840	B
and other kids do very well in junior colleges and other kids do very well in residential college environments um	3840	B
and i think it really depends upon the individual the safest bet for most people who want uh	3840	B
uh a good quality experience is a private college where they're gonna get an opportunity to have more personal contact and uh	3840	B
where they're going to be forced by the circumstances to learn more than might be the case in a big university	3840	B
no i went to a big university i went um i went to Pitt as an undergraduate and i looked at small colleges and frankly um	3840	B
i think i had this sense that it would have been more difficult at small colleges and i think it would- would have been definitely i mean i	3840	B
i graduated Phi Beta Kappa summa cum laude and went on to do a PhD and i think that uh had i gone to a small college i might have learned a lot more but i don't think my grades would have been nearly as good	3840	B
i think you can get away with more in a big uh a big university uh what what kind of experience have you had in this regard	3840	B
uh-huh	3840	B
that's big yeah	3840	B
oh yeah	3840	B
well that's all right go ahead	3840	B
uh-huh	3840	B
no kidding	3840	B
um-hum	3840	B
right	3840	B
yeah	3840	B
what i think is one of the problems with with a kid going to a large university generally and this happens at Stanford at Cal out here	3840	B
i- i think that the the residential college experience is generally the best for most kids some kids are particularly- pardon me	3840	B
well i mean uh let me let me give you an example of a college that would fit that description	3840	B
um i would say that uh some of the best colleges in the country	3840	B
are small residential colleges like Swarthmore College like um Amherst Wesleyan Williams College	3840	B
um those are places that that in academia are generally regarded as the best places to get liberal arts educations	3840	B
on the other hand you can go to a big university and do very well and some big universities i don't know whether Bringham Young is like this but some have a small college feel to them you don't get a lot of foreign TAs you- i mean in other words that the people who teach really know how to teach	3840	B
and i think that's what important for a lot of kids uh in my case	3840	B
i went through uh between sixty eight and seventy two in college and it was just this big uh grade game for me	3840	B
and i learned some things and i just luckily stumbled in the right area	3840	B
um but i was years out of graduate school i had worked in industry before i ever came back and wanted to use my training as a scientist to um	3840	B
you know to get anything done and as matter of fact i'm i'm working on a book and a theory	3840	B
uh which has its foundations ultimately in theoretical physics and i'd never would have imagined myself wanting to do something like that i had such a negative-	3840	B
um Lee what advice do you have for someone choosing a college	3840	A
uh-huh did you go to a private college for your undergraduate	3840	A
uh-huh	3840	A
well um	3840	A
i went to a private university although it was a large private university it was Bringham Young University in Utah and that's uh has about twenty seven thousand students	3840	A
so it's it's pretty big	3840	A
but	3840	A
i enjoyed my experience there one thing i was thinking about this topic is um	3840	A
i would try and get a lot of input from	3840	A
from other students who had gone to the college in the particular program and see how they liked it for example i made well- i had a bad experience in graduate school	3840	A
and i think i would never have gone to the place had i have went and visited the place and talked to some of the students who were currently in the program for example i um started graduate school um	3840	A
in well i don't know if i should give specific names but uh it was	3840	A
um it was just in a physics program back east and um well it happened to be in Pittsburgh it was the University- it was Carnegie Melon University and	3840	A
the teaching assistantship situation just was not very good it turned out that um	3840	A
there were six new teaching assistants from the US who went we all quit after our first year of graduate school um	3840	A
it turned out that the undergraduates had thrown a big fit the several years before that they weren't learning from the foreign TAs and they had six new students from- foreign TAs-	3840	A
TAs also but the foreign TAs could not teach the classes and so there was a huge teaching burden on us the US um	3840	A
TAs and so it's we were really bogged down and	3840	A
you mean community college type or you mean by residential college do you mean	3840	A
oh i see oh	3840	A
oh yeah	3840	A
i i don't have a lot of things that invade my every- everyday privacy probably the the one thing that i feel is a is a bother is uh soliciting over the phone	3882	A
from uh either for donations for different things or	3882	A
in the local area uh we have quite a bit of this i understand there's a a law now where some companies are unable to do this after the first of January but i haven't i really don't know too much about that but	3882	A
i really- other than that i don't really have anything that uh i feel invades my- my privacy how about you	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
well that's- that's good uh i don't think	3882	A
yes i	3882	A
you bet and once you order something it seems like you get on their list and they send everything	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
that's	3882	A
uh-huh yeah	3882	A
uh that that's true and i don't know how you you stop that if you order anything at all	3882	A
and then use your credit card or get anything from any mail order catalogs or anything then everybody starts sending the stuff	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
right and i don't know what can be done about that but uh i'm sure that this is	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
well that's great that's good to hear i'll	3882	A
uh-huh well i have a son and uh	3882	A
hm yes well that that would be great i mean you know	3882	A
yes it is like you say we're paying for it one way or the other	3882	A
and the postage and uh and	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
we don't have a lot of that uh where i live uh very little but i would imagine that where you live in a larger area	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
well	3882	A
it really would be and and then the that really invades it plus uh you- you just trying to settle down to do something and then uh here they come and they had	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
oh	3882	A
oh my goodness-	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
yes oh wow yeah	3882	A
i'm sure we must have um well i'm i'm sure we have a law in uh in Brigham City on that because uh we very- very seldom	3882	A
uh have anyone coming around but once in a while somebody will come in and then uh the word gets out and then nobody in the neighborhood will answer the door but uh	3882	A
we don't have maybe oh two or three times a year so there's there's got to be something uh i'm sure that that	3882	A
prohibits them from doing that	3882	A
but uh	3882	A
all of these are really irritants and things that we really don't need	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
yes	3882	A
and uh	3882	A
that's true and then some of the advertisements on television some of the things uh that you might want or records or something i dare sent uh	3882	A
i dare sent order any of that stuff because then	3882	A
i feel that the mail is also it's the telephones and the mails that get me i think the mails all these ads and things that they send and there should be a limit on that also	3882	B
not only financially but it's costing me and us really in advertising we're paying for all that junk that we throw in the	3882	B
that's right and they have a and then you get your list there of privacy you know out of that comes the um and then then being able to use your name	3882	B
and that's invading your privacy to me now that is one of the biggest one another big one	3882	B
taking your name from lists	3882	B
i know it is it's outrageous how you get the piles of it and uh and then even- it even- even gets to the point where they um	3882	B
oh they can mess up your credit bad with it you know as far as your with your um	3882	B
when you get on all these lists and all they can invade that part of it	3882	B
and	3882	B
i know there is a number i think that or uh the post office you can send in a number and i don't have it myself in fact i thought of getting it my sister has it and said we she'd give it to me and she lives in Ohio	3882	B
and uh there is a number that you can send or a place that you can send to the post office and give them your address and tell them you don't want anymore of this and i just haven't done in fact she was just telling me about it recently	3882	B
so i thought i might check with her on it and get that number and	3882	B
and have a lot of that junk mail stopped because_1 i really that	3882	B
it's a big irritant to me but	3882	B
uh-huh we are	3882	B
and door-to-door soliciting can be another	3882	B
don't you	3882	B
yeah it's a it's as much as a phone call you know invading your privacy and we do hear in a lot of it in Richardson there's quite a bit of it	3882	B
yeah i did have to laugh though they had the um	3882	B
they had the invasion of privacy law uh for weekends now here in Richardson they signed me to see uh	3882	B
on Saturdays and Sundays there is no soliciting allowed- allowed	3882	B
and they even stopped the little Brownies and Girl Scouts from selling their cookies and that really got us and we laughed about it because with one of the um editorials on it was	3882	B
it was great the guy went on about how the little Brownie came or Girl Scout came to the door and the police arrested her for selling their cookies and it was kind of a cute	3882	B
pun against that part of it but you know where do you stop it's true	3882	B
really	3882	B
oh really	3882	B
uh-huh	3882	B
oh well that's good	3882	B
uh-huh	3882	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3882	B
now that's true and it is an invasion- and each time it's a breakdown of our system you know each one is a breakdown of our systems	3882	B
of your privacy- your own privacy	3882	B
that can be very irritable	3882	B
do you have kids in the Texas schools	3873	A
you know the way the question is worded it sounds like the person who made up the questions thinks there is something wrong the way they say is there something seriously wrong this- indicates that she thought that there was something wrong to begin with	3873	A
did you like the schooling	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
so they didn't grow up in Irving	3873	A
oh yeah	3873	A
yeah i sure do i have four uh well three of them are in school in the Plano schools and i really like the schools	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
yeah i think you're right	3873	A
yeah that's such such a hard line because parents want to have control over their children	3873	A
you know so they want don't want anyone to discipline them and yet they also want this same person who doesn't have the authority to discipline them to command respect and the two don't go hand in hand	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
not only that but so many parents nowadays work and that's a low priority you know that is just some place that the kids go while they work	3873	A
and so it's not like they have the time to sit and think about those kind of things because	3873	A
you know they have job career and you know and other things on their mind	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
that's right see my husband is the treasurer of the middle school that my daughter goes to and they're just always amazed at the lack of participation of the	3873	A
the parents and the things that they you know the programs that they try to put on and no one comes and they you know finally have kind of decided they're not interested and we i guess we shouldn't be either and that's kind of sad	3873	A
um-hum	3873	A
that's right	3873	A
kind of a job	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
yeah yeah that's that's exactly right	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
see i've noticed with my elementary kids also that they want them_1 to grow up so fast	3873	A
you know that they want them_1 to have it's good to teach them_1 responsibility but boy the punishment	3873	A
uh i don't now my children are all grown but they did go through the Texas school system	3873	B
uh yes but it was in a smaller town and uh it was in a town where i knew uh uh an awful lot of the people and kept track of them_1 and i think that made a difference i	3873	B
no they grew up in uh a town in uh north Texas in Sherman do you have children here	3873	B
well i think Plano has a fairly good system because uh well just looking by the uh uh some of the scores coming out	3873	B
uh my children well now we did not uh they did not go to school until uh uh junior high but they were in Sherman Texas	3873	B
and one of my cousins was the principal but some of the problems i see now is i think uh	3873	B
some uh as i said my children have been out for quite a while but a lot of my friends have children and i can see a difference from between when my sons went through and what their children are doing and it seems to me that uh	3873	B
they're they're spending less and less uh	3873	B
uh well my children had to have a lot more respect for their teachers than i think the- the- the students now days do	3873	B
and i think there is the uh	3873	B
that respect has has carried over and uh um they're they're not being taught respect	3873	B
uh	3873	B
unless and i don't know what you can do about it other than you know that is one of the the examples one of the examples i see	3873	B
no i think also too you're you're right in the fact i think parents there is a lack of participation among parents it's uh too often the school is used as a dumping ground	3873	B
yeah uh but you're right i hadn't thought about that but	3873	B
but uh well also you know	3873	B
they they don't go	3873	B
to the open houses to the the parent teacher you know	3873	B
there's just a very small minority of of uh parents that do that	3873	B
that is i think uh	3873	B
one of the things that i see course this is uh	3873	B
uh just- again an outsider view is too often that the school system is set up now uh based on the way it was for the last two hundred years on an an agrarian society uh culture	3873	B
and the life styles now like you said there are too many two parent uh working parents and uh a lot of them_1 work uh there is not your nine to five shifts there's a lot of shifts	3873	B
and it's a shame they cannot set up school systems that uh are not based on a Monday through Friday uh kind of you know a job	3873	B
or uh i wouldn't mind seeing evening you know uh utilizing- utilizing the schools uh opening up an evening uh	3873	B
you know a morning school and an evening school	3873	B
that way the the buildings would but now i am looking at other areas where they're having problems with over crowding and uh	3873	B
course you you'd have to have more teachers for that also but you could utilize the buildings just as well and it would be based on the life styles of their families	3873	B
so that's a you know that's just a possibility	3873	B
and again i think also a lot of times they they	3873	B
there needs to be more emphasis on some of your basic education	3873	B
uh reading skills especially	3873	B
oh yeah that's	3873	B
why don't you start because_1 i'm sure you've seen more movies than i have	3858	A
no have you	3858	A
no and i -like i heard some bad reviews on that	3858	A
yeah yeah have you seen any lately what about videos	3858	A
is it a new one with him	3858	A
it wasn't Hudson Hawk was it	3858	A
oh i haven't see that one	3858	A
oh even i mean Keenan Ivory yeah i guess so Ivory is his last name	3858	A
uh-huh	3858	A
uh-huh	3858	A
well i had a little more time to think while they were trying to find somebody and you know i haven't seen i haven't seen um any current releases my husband and i just don't get out to the movies that much	3858	A
um no but we we're lazy we like to rent and watch them_1 and be able to rewind them and say what he say	3858	A
we saw well we saw Flatliners i like that a lot	3858	A
yeah and um let's see Awakenings did you see that	3858	A
oh it was great it was real good it was kind of and it's a true story or so they say yeah about these people that that uh like	3858	A
near comatose i guess you'd say and they uh with medication they're able to wake them_1 up after- after like twenty thirty years and i mean it's not a real action packed movie but it was pretty neat	3858	A
ooh and did you like that one you did okay and	3858	A
you know i've been wanting to i every time i go to the movie store to rent that it's all rented	3858	A
yeah i mean i've been at least three or four times just to get that movie and every time i go i guess i must be going at the wrong times	3858	A
i did see Beauty and the Beast it's beautiful	3858	A
yeah just go to a matinee there's so many kids there nobody will notice- notice that you're not you know with a kid i said there's there's so many people you won't notice you're not they won't notice you're not with anybody	3858	A
yes	3858	A
hm yeah i saw that one too did you like that one	3858	A
did you that was pretty long one	3858	A
how many times did you see Dances with Wolves	3858	A
you did	3858	A
uh i did too it was so sweet	3858	A
yeah i wanna see that one too my husband kind of went hm	3858	A
so he wasn't real excited about going to see that one have may have to go with my mom	3858	A
oh really yeah i'll probably wait for that one to came up on video it has to be real good for me to spend the money	3858	A
which one	3858	A
oh i haven't seen that one either	3858	A
you cried in Terminator 2	3858	A
okay let's see have- uh did you say you'd seen Flatliners yeah okay what about let's see Edward Scissorhands	3858	A
i just loved that movie that was so sweet	3858	A
oh no i haven't either my in in fact we're supposed to get out to movies tonight but i don't know what we're gonna go see	3858	A
yeah well we might be going to a late one yeah	3858	A
yeah see we've got HBO and you they have to be pretty old to get on there	3858	A
well i think so i think they have a lot of the same ones run over and over again	3858	A
yeah that's what i hate is they overdo it when you know when they get a major release	3858	A
yeah is it good	3858	A
is it	3858	A
yeah well my dad is if you can believe that but i'm not a real Tom Cruise fan	3858	A
nah he's okay but i don't think i don't see uh what i guess all the young girls see in him	3858	A
i don't know um let's see have you seen John F Kennedy	3858	B
no i wanted to go see that one i was hoping my roommate went and saw it and she liked it what about um Hand That Rocks the Cradle	3858	B
it's supposed to be kind of scary well let's	3858	B
no well i mean	3858	B
um let's see	3858	B
well actually i have seen one i'm trying to think of the name of it um	3858	B
it's got Bruce Willis in it and um	3858	B
yeah but i can't think of who's in it but it was real good	3858	B
no huh-uh that was horrible	3858	B
um it's the guy that's- from In Living Color	3858	B
i yeah well- you you know who i'm talking about i'm trying to	3858	B
well i can't think of it but that was it was really i thought i liked it because_1 it was funny and they had so many it was i mean it was really action packed and it was bloody but they had a lot of um	3858	B
like one liners and stuff but i cannot think of the name i'm so bad with names of movies	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
do you have children	3858	B
oh	3858	B
i hear you well Leslie there's um a ton	3858	B
now what was that like	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
um-hum	3858	B
i remember the name of it's called The Last Boy Scout it was with Bruce Willis and i can't think of the other name the guy's name but yeah it was good	3858	B
i'm trying to think well- uh what about City Slickers since you watch um	3858	B
that's the same with same with me	3858	B
okay well um let's see	3858	B
well i want to go see that one but i'll probably wait for it- till it comes out on video because_1 i don't think i can get any my date to take me	3858	B
well- that's why i'm	3858	B
doing it well-	3858	B
yeah that's true well um what about did you see Dances with Wolves	3858	B
i saw that two or three times and then what's the other one Kevin Costner was in	3858	B
Robin Hood	3858	B
okay yeah i've i've probably seen it about three times um-hum	3858	B
yeah but i like Kevin Costner	3858	B
i only watched that once	3858	B
yeah and i cried	3858	B
uh i could probably tell you more that i wanna see than i have seen what about um Fried Green Tomatoes	3858	B
yeah well	3858	B
well a friend of mine went to see is it what's the name of it Father of the Bride with Steve Martin and she said that was real cute um-hum	3858	B
what about the one with um Arnold Schwarzenegger whatever	3858	B
Terminator 2	3858	B
well that's good i cried at that one too	3858	B
yeah at the at the end i won't tell you but i'll miss that	3858	B
yeah	3858	B
that i saw for the first time uh uh probably about two weeks ago	3858	B
um-hum that's cute then there're some what are some other ones i wonder	3858	B
i haven't really seen that many new ones because-	3858	B
now it's too late now	3858	B
no well- um trying to think what else i've seen	3858	B
that's even- i guess if i see them_1 it's because they come on HBO or whatever	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
well see now Edward Scissorhands been on there like every week now	3858	B
i'm trying	3858	B
and then well what about the one with Tom Cruise in it that's an old one Days of Thunder	3858	B
really	3858	B
it- it- it's okay probably have to be a Tom Cruise fan	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
well it was yes what do you think about the uh former Soviet Union	3864	B
yeah	3864	B
it seems that way sometimes you wonder if um an economic threat isn't gonna drive people to do things that would be more drastic than if uh they were a little bit more peaceful you know	3864	B
but i think it would probably not be a a threat to the United States if that was the case but probably to Europe other other areas of Europe there	3864	B
well that's what it seemed like even before they uh dissolved the Union was that it was becoming less and less of a of a threat to the United States uh more and more of an attempted	3864	B
uh you know relating on more or less normal bases	3864	B
are you involved in	3864	B
oh that's right	3864	B
that's for sure are you involved in any kind of uh political analysis or anything	3864	B
no not really we're involved in some of our company work in the Soviet Union in different places but not in	3864	B
uh any area of uh endeavor that would be of any interest to you know militarily or anything like that	3864	B
uh linguistics primarily	3864	B
and so it's interesting to see uh how things are going there and and their the people that are there are facing the same kind of	3864	B
uh economic deprivation that uh you know the Russian citizens are but not- it doesn't relate to much to the military uh situation	3864	B
yes	3864	B
yeah i read an interesting- an article in a recent uh	3864	B
Wall Street Journal uh interview with a family there and	3864	B
you know we think of uh how great it is to go to a you know free market uh sort of thing and and they're saying- facing uh something that most people are not even aware you know familiar with they wouldn't- they don't know how to deal with it and uh how do you	3864	B
how do you compete when you you're whole you know life has been built on uh working for the state and everything you know things like that	3864	B
yeah right	3864	B
you face the same uh uh bureaucratic uh headaches whether you work or don't work so- and so now they've you know so really it must be uh really traumatic time for the people as well as the uh	3864	B
lack of supplies or anything like that adjusting to the new way of thinking about things	3864	B
um-hum	3864	B
yeah right	3864	B
taught to understand that's right yeah	3864	B
well perhaps the uh if we give aid of some sort you know maybe it'll turn them_1 around if it's done done correctly you know economically-	3864	B
sure	3864	B
you mean in in our country or in	3864	B
sure	3864	B
yeah you can't that's right and well i hope you know just hope we don't wait too long and and uh you know	3864	B
that's that's a timely kind of a question isn't it	3864	A
i really don't think that i would consider them a threat any longer and i suppose that's primarily because	3864	A
their economy really won't allow them to uh expend a lot of	3864	A
resources on on war um if that were their primary concern	3864	A
and it'll be a while before they're an economic threat for sure	3864	A
um-hum um-hum	3864	A
do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they would be a threat uh that given their political changes they would still be a threat or	3864	A
um-hum um-hum	3864	A
right	3864	A
there there've been such drastic changes in their political orientation that it's	3864	A
hard to predict what it will look like in fifty years but certainly so far what we've seen is a turn around from where things were fifty years ago	3864	A
no no and yourself	3864	A
really	3864	A
uh-huh personal interests or business	3864	A
uh-huh	3864	A
yes	3864	A
yes yeah their problems are definitely at this point economic it it seems that the whole infrastructure is focused on you know organizational um	3864	A
skimming off the top you know especially the government but um it's gonna be awhile before the people adopt the philosophy that	3864	A
if you work harder you can also benefit personally and that	3864	A
um-hum	3864	A
um-hum	3864	A
and and almost um the philosophy has been put in as little as you can because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so why spend the extra energy	3864	A
uh-huh	3864	A
yeah	3864	A
i wonder too if their thinking hasn't been so influenced over the years that the Western way is bad that	3864	A
it would it's hard for them to look at some of the Western market place strategies as being good because they've been	3864	A
propagandized the other direction for so long	3864	A
i think that they're one economy that i feel that that's worth the investment you know there are some	3864	A
um places in the world where i'm not sure that the money that the United States is putting in is really getting the kind of return that that's gonna benefit both parties but	3864	A
um it seems that there's such an effort to make it work there that what they really do need is is the loans and the	3864	A
uh strategic assistance from other countries i'll i'll be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesn't seem as though that's forth coming right now um	3864	A
that	3864	A
yeah i think well i was watching something the other day a news program that that indicated um	3864	A
the concern on Bush's part is that if he puts	3864	A
great interest in that area now he's gonna be accused of not spending enough time on the domestic issues you know certainly foreign issues are his strength so it's a catch twenty two	3864	A
you say you a Steeler fan	3859	A
so did i no kidding	3859	A
yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterday's Super Bowl	3859	A
he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career	3859	A
well that's what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think that's the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people	3859	A
um	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
no	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
how about_1 Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
well i had- you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um they've certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadn't lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game	3859	A
but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end	3859	A
well Montana made a difference but as the analysts- analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday	3859	A
Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i- i frankly am surprised that	3859	A
um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays	3859	A
yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i mean- you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself	3859	A
because_1 they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal	3859	A
and uh	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
it it's it's it's nine years ago	3859	A
yeah it's been- been a while	3859	A
well it is it is a little disappointing and there's some it it's very interesting to see you know what's what's behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the the draft picks would uh	3859	A
you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference	3859	A
uh i don't understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didn't do anything uh Cincinnati they didn't do anything now uh Buffalo	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
well you know i think that's sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad	3859	A
i mean i just it's it's it's shameful and and i think that that once Pandora's out of the box you know	3859	A
so i don't know i- i- i- i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think it's it's reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call what-	3859	A
well there yeah there- there is that problem and- and- but uh i guess that that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid	3859	A
all right uh yeah not as much as i used to be i- i grew up in Pittsburgh and	3859	B
did you yeah i left there i went to school out that way that about forty miles east of Pittsburgh and then uh	3859	B
i left in the mid sixties and right after i left well a few years later they started having some good teams	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah he's looking good he's sixty i think and he just you know	3859	B
yeah for considering	3859	B
yeah they just uh i don't know what happened they just weren't getting any draft picks and weren't i guess they just weren't picking the right guy weren't right people	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
right	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
yeah they uh he was loyal to a lot of those guys that	3859	B
helped uh helped him win those Super Bowls in the seventies and uh stuck with him too long and then i think the	3859	B
the draft uh picks did fall on hard times and they just never were able to get back to where they were	3859	B
but uh uh we've lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years and i've never become a Cowboys fan in fact i don't i just don't like them_1 at all but	3859	B
i	3859	B
oh i like them better than the Cowboys i don't i just uh	3859	B
other than the Steelers i don't have a real a real favorite uh like the Eagles i like the Redskins but uh usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing for the most part you're a Forty Niner fan	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
hum	3859	B
yeah yeah they had	3859	B
yeah they weren't the same without Montana	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
oh was he calling the plays i didn't even	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah he had a	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
right yeah well couple of those passes a couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped some important uh passes too they it would have made might have made a little bit of a difference not much but uh	3859	B
i don't i- i just looked in the paper this this evening and trying to figure out when the last time the AFC won a game guess it was eighty four Raiders	3859	B
Raiders beat uh the Redskins i think as a matter of fact but boy it's	3859	B
i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because_1 i'm getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh	3859	B
right	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
yeah well	3859	B
Buffalo twice- well they did get close last year they could have won last Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants	3859	B
but uh just seems like there's a big gap in talent between the or maybe in coaching between the AFC and the NFC because_1 it's like i said it's been nine years or eight years since they uh since AFCs won a game	3859	B
but uh i guess they're gonna somebody was saying uh somebody- i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going	3859	B
um-hum yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
well	3859	B
um yeah i just don't like it it it delays the game it delays uh i don't know it it just kind of interrupts- interrupts the flow of things and uh i	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
-okay	3883	A
so how'd you just figure	3883	A
wow	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
oh huh uh	3883	A
well um	3883	A
i'm going to talk about when i was working as a teacher and when i was um what i'm what i'm doing now um when i was a teacher um in Utah	3883	A
i would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that and	3883	A
even when it um rained and snowed i just braved it and i wore heels anyways because_1 and	3883	A
oh oh yeah well i need all the height i can get	3883	A
oh yeah	3883	A
uh-huh yeah me too um if it was really- it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots but then i would change um into heels as soon as i got to my desk so um	3883	A
oh	3883	A
oh	3883	A
sure uh-huh	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
yeah	3883	A
oh huh	3883	A
oh well um	3883	A
yeah um	3883	A
the first two years i was in a room where they didn't heat it	3883	A
so i did	3883	A
yeah and the third year we um got heating so	3883	A
it was nice	3883	A
right uh-huh	3883	A
oh that's nice	3883	A
uh-huh oh nice well	3883	A
uh no we we moved to Iowa and um i'm working at a day care right now	3883	A
and so the way i dress is really different because i'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months	3883	A
yeah i wear uh tennis shoes and jeans and things that you know are sort of um not	3883	A
yeah if it doesn't matter if i have to wash it a hundred times or something	3883	A
yeah but i never wore jeans because_1 um i thought that was too casual	3883	A
for	3883	A
yeah really	3883	A
yeah that's how i feel too	3883	A
um oh it there's some good things about it that i've seen a lot of things i'm not used to yet um	3883	A
um we lived in Utah before and and i grew up in California	3883	A
well you know it depends upon our weather here you know today was a beautiful day it was like uh uh summer day it was seventy degrees so	3883	B
so i dressed in um uh a light weight skirt it's a uh ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan	3883	B
over it because i had some appointments at the office today some interviews and so i had to dress up anyway and then i wore heels you know	3883	B
but when it rains a lot which it has been doing here a lot lately uh very often you know wear uh pants and boots	3883	B
you know so how do you dress	3883	B
okay	3883	B
um-hum	3883	B
yeah i can- i can see i i've been a teacher so has my daughter and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring	3883	B
that's right	3883	B
that's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids right	3883	B
yeah i do too so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades uh older grades i had to wear heels	3883	B
um-hum	3883	B
well of course we wear uh an unlined boot you know it it has a heel on it that's the kind of boots that i wear to work	3883	B
and we wear them_1 you know they're a leather boot that you wear as i said they have a regular heel on them high heel	3883	B
and they wear them_1 we wear them a lot with shirts and things	3883	B
in Texas that you wear these boots they're not a cowboy boot but they're just a real pretty boot but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain	3883	B
as i have a private high school that i run here and so when i'm interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels	3883	B
you know and look like i'm a business person you know	3883	B
because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often you know	3883	B
of course you probably wear coats a lot	3883	B
oh my goodness so then you had to	3883	B
yes then things improved right	3883	B
but of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot	3883	B
you know you know and uh that's very seldom we it depends upon our winter we have a few days you might wear a coat winter coat	3883	B
you know but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much we often laugh about even when it turns chilly we're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that	3883	B
it's really different let's put it that way are you not teaching anymore	3883	B
i see	3883	B
oh so you don't wear heels anymore i'll bet	3883	B
yeah uh-huh	3883	B
more practical	3883	B
when- when you were teaching did you ever have uh uh a blue jean day or anything like that	3883	B
yeah yeah well i know that in some of the schools they have uh	3883	B
country western day or something like that when you know or tacky day and i always thought it was kind of out of	3883	B
got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too	3883	B
it's all right for the students they look tacky a lot but i didn't think teachers should you know	3883	B
yeah uh do you like uh uh Iowa	3883	B
where did you live before	3883	B
oh well that's quite a change from California to Utah	3883	B
well i guess we're uh	3887	B
forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that	3887	B
the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels- fuels are being experimented with ethanol and	3887	B
other types of fuels	3887	B
i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i	3887	B
i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from what comes over the border from us	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um	3887	B
do away with the CFCs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem	3887	B
again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was	3887	B
uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially	3887	B
well it is scary and i think it will uh	3887	B
continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively	3887	B
we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment	3887	B
i- i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that in Los Angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh	3887	B
barbecues gasoline lawn mowers	3887	B
um and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles and it's gotten bad in Denver and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky	3887	B
and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
well that makes a lot of sense i mean i- i hadn't thought about it that way but it it	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth	3887	B
which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a uh a whole	3887	B
set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a	3887	B
big structural change in the economy	3887	B
uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in- in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars	3887	B
and uh i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but	3887	B
i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure	3887	B
how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy	3887	B
is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell	3887	B
uh	3887	A
yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from	3887	A
or sources	3887	A
that's what i would think	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area	3887	A
uh any any industry that burns you know	3887	A
and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real	3887	A
into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick	3887	A
but i don't know if that affects outside	3887	A
you know i- i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it yeah	3887	A
yeah that's it it's kind of scary	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces	3887	A
i think it will	3887	A
uh-huh	3887	A
right	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah in this area too since you know in Texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh	3887	A
it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas	3887	A
and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in	3887	A
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets	3887	A
you don't have to have mountains there stopping it	3887	A
and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings and uh	3887	A
so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here	3887	A
right	3887	A
um-hum	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but	3887	A
uh well i guess we're not as bad as a lot of places but uh we're out here on the Great Plains so there's some place for it to go	3888	B
yeah	3888	B
yeah i've heard that	3888	B
um-hum	3888	B
yeah i think that's probably the problem with any of the coastal cities i think that's what New York has such a problem with	3888	B
you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast	3888	B
i don't think it's as bad yeah	3888	B
i know there's some because in my visits to New York i noticed that my i wear i'm a contact lens wearer and i noticed that i have to uh take out my contacts	3888	B
yeah i can't wear them_1 as many hours during the day as i can other places but you know i mean that's not just New York i mean that's also Europe you know Rome is the worst city i've ever been at	3888	B
course now i hear that uh you now like Mexico City is real bad for that	3888	B
and also places in Brazil like Sao Paulo you know	3888	B
yeah	3888	B
well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever	3888	B
so whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we have they just like fire away you know	3888	B
they control nothing i mean it's like it's like you know the situation- it you know Brazil even though there's there's in Brazil uh it- it's my understanding because i have some friends there that are Brazilian	3888	B
uh there's an upper-class and a lower-class and no middle-class	3888	B
and so you know the lower class is working uh in the factories which pollute the air and the upper classes make the money off of the factories	3888	B
and so pollution is a big problem for all of the you know underdeveloped countries because_1 they're not going to they're not going to start instituting regulations that are going to impede their whatever industry they happen to have	3888	B
which you know that's kind of going to be the end result you know Bush- i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory	3888	B
uh things right now that are going to impede business the first effect that it has had is the EPA had some new regs up	3888	B
for um congressional approval that had to do with making industries uh itemize uh different types of things that they were you know	3888	B
putting into the air you know part of the clean air act you know which is to help enforce the clean air act and so that of course you know the moratorium on new regulations has you know hamstrung that	3888	B
absolutely not	3888	B
not any profit driven industry because you know they're just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything that's going to take away from profits i mean we're we're living in the greed generation here i mean there is no there is	3888	B
sure i mean you know	3888	B
i mean i've heard- i've heard that before and i'm now beginning to believe it because	3888	B
you know what i mean i have some limited involvement in some in some what you would call i guess environmental type entities i'm an attorney and i write letters for a number of environmental um	3888	B
uh purposes and you know it it is amazing to me that people can sit here and look at the situation that we have globally and say you know what the hell	3888	B
because uh you know it's it's really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry you know are going away	3888	B
well how polluted do you think we are down here	3888	A
i think so	3888	A
uh-huh	3888	A
yeah i guess so and it's still a little bit flat around here and there's no specific mountains to hem it in	3888	A
uh we used to live in California and although we were not in the smoggy area of Los Angeles we used to visit down there and honestly you could	3888	A
you could you could see the smog hanging over the city it's just about uh	3888	A
yes we can and a friend of mine lives out in San Bernardino	3888	A
and uh uh just beyond San Bernardino	3888	A
is the desert and separating San Bernardino from the desert are some mountain ranges and when the smog gets very very bad in Los Angeles it moves out there and then is bounded	3888	A
it's a very very strange thing	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
yeah although you know	3888	A
um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
yeah	3888	A
i- i do think that's what's one of the real problems although i grew up in New York and i never noticed this kind of pollution as i- i saw in uh you know southern California	3888	A
and then um-hum	3888	A
yes um-hum	3888	A
oh	3888	A
clean them	3888	A
uh oh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
uh	3888	A
oh uh-huh	3888	A
oh i see well i've never been down there	3888	A
is that right well what are they doing down there that causes such a thing what kind of industries do they have	3888	A
i see	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
i see um	3888	A
oh i see um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um-hum um	3888	A
oh i see uh-huh um	3888	A
um	3888	A
profits i guess	3888	A
um-hum yeah uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
right	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
that's right uh-huh i- i know that	3888	A
a lot of the European countries and Mexico and the South American countries simply do not have the governmental regulations and i think that unless the government is uh	3888	A
on top of this or at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going to be done by private industry until they you know get that push it really wasn't done in our country	3888	A
you know um um-hum yeah uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
uh-huh the greed generation oh what a terrible thing to say uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
oh i see	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
oh i know um um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um	3888	A
oh	3888	A
no i don't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer	3801	B
uh	3801	B
uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something's happens on Mockingbird	3801	B
and then heard yells and screams and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house	3801	B
and they had stopped a uh a stolen car	3801	B
and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back	3801	B
by- on my house	3801	B
so i'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it	3801	B
it was	3801	B
i uh i kept hearing noises and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage so i got a gun- my gun	3801	B
and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure	3801	B
is Plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area	3801	B
that's too bad	3801	B
um-hum um-hum	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
well i was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen Plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
yeah	3801	B
well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway	3801	B
uh well it's further west of me	3801	B
i live over near White Rock Lake	3801	B
but uh uh it was really frightening to think that uh it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth uh i never thought about someone robbing those	3801	B
but apparently they do	3801	B
yeah it just doesn't seem possible does it	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
no	3801	B
yeah	3801	B
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see	3801	B
it it is convenient isn't it i didn't know what i was doing	3801	B
that kind of	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
well yes and i work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System and uh uh uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are	3801	B
uh no this is over near Lincoln High School	3801	B
uh just not far off South Central Expressway	3801	B
it is a pretty rough area we're over by Fair Park	3801	B
and uh	3801	B
you know you watch the people there are marvelous BMW's and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns	3801	B
and the kids see that and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
it surely is	3801	B
well i'm careful	3801	B
yeah it's uh a little scary sometimes and uh i manage the	3801	B
well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone you're in	3801	A
i'm afraid you're right	3801	A
oh my	3801	A
oh boy	3801	A
by your house	3801	A
oh my goodness ah aye aye	3801	A
oh my that's that's got to be a frightening way to spend- spend an evening	3801	A
oh boy	3801	A
unfortunately yes yes	3801	A
i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get	3801	A
the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there and i think uh	3801	A
you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek but uh we've been we've lived here sixteen years and	3801	A
now you you know you -can tell the change for sure	3801	A
yes	3801	A
well with all the uh	3801	A
Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the	3801	A
uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by you know and	3801	A
that's that couldn't be too far from you neither uh	3801	A
okay_1	3801	A
oh yes okay	3801	A
i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but	3801	A
it's kind of	3801	A
kind of stupid isn't it	3801	A
but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right	3801	A
i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too	3801	A
right	3801	A
right right just like the old alcohol idea and	3801	A
i think people uh	3801	A
i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are	3801	A
too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money	3801	A
oh boy where do you work	3801	A
uh yes i think i do that uh	3801	A
is that Amelia Earhart -Earhart School there	3801	A
okay	3801	A
that's a pretty rough area there isn't it	3801	A
um my goodness	3801	A
huh	3801	A
definitely that area that that's big time big time there sure is	3801	A
i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself in that area	3801	A
gee that's the worst neighborhood in the whole city- area	3801	A
okay	3847	B
uh no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's	3847	B
really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas i used to live in Arizona and it was very confusing- very frustrating because_1 i didn't have the	3847	B
watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough water automatically- you know naturally as well as have the automatic sprinklers and so it's a lot more rewarding	3847	B
so	3847	B
oh that's right	3847	B
um-hum is is that enough during the hotter times of the year	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah i- i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and-	3847	B
and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they'd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would	3847	B
come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting	3847	B
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so	3847	B
um i'm gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that	3847	B
you know feels	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah those are enjoyable	3847	B
oh did you	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
um those are nice	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
yeah yeah i haven't done much in in bulbs in fact i received as a Christmas present a a	3847	B
a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and	3847	B
it's just nice and green right now	3847	B
uh no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a paper- white paper flower or something	3847	B
and uh so i don't know	3847	B
no not really and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we had some	3847	B
some play yard last over but it's	3847	B
it's um you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's that's about the size of most of them_1	3847	B
and	3847	B
yeah	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
uh yeah	3847	B
yeah	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
oh do you	3847	B
oh	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
that's one part of gardening i haven't tried yet and i don't think this yard is a very	3847	B
-okay i pushed it	3847	A
so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it	3847	A
uh-huh	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
yeah right	3847	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3847	A
well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything but um our water supply right now is bad we need rain badly	3847	A
uh we can water here and Patterson i can water on Tuesdays Thursdays	3847	A
Saturday and Sunday four days a week	3847	A
so	3847	A
it was this last summer yeah	3847	A
uh now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know	3847	A
but um yeah we do our lawn- our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i	3847	A
do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers	3847	A
and uh	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
oh	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
yeah	3847	A
yeah we have quite a few roses i just uh we in fact we just pruned them_1 uh way down and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them_1 so i just bought that yesterday and uh probably go outside today and plant that	3847	A
but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long	3847	A
i even had uh roses on my table for Christmas dinner	3847	A
which was really pretty you know but um other than the roses i don't have too many flowers i plant gladiolas	3847	A
and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they they bend over so fast	3847	A
you know	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
hum	3847	A
um-hum well is it that one of those Amaryllis	3847	A
no huh	3847	A
oh okay	3847	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3847	A
do you have a big yard	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
yeah right right	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
um	3847	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum well that makes it nice	3847	A
well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool but we don't have one	3847	A
you know but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have	3847	A
so we do have a garden you know	3847	A
it's just a small one you know but we had a lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini	3847	A
uh it's amazing- it's amazing what you can get out of a little	3847	A
you know it's probably about twenty by	3847	A
i don't know	3847	A
twenty by six something like that and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there	3847	A
but it was nice a few cucumbers	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
why don't you tell me about your choir	3810	A
um-hum	3810	A
great	3810	A
um i play the piano	3810	A
and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano	3810	A
he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby	3810	A
uh my husband and my other son who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at Music Man	3810	A
yeah and it was lots of fun	3810	A
um	3810	A
basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions it was the Plano Repertory Theatre	3810	A
and so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band	3810	A
so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school and my daughter takes piano lessons too	3810	A
but uh we just really like music it's a i- i especially like it as an outlet when the TV goes off we get the TV off and and just have some nice quiet music	3810	A
um-hum	3810	A
um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki	3810	A
which is an auditory type learning experience you listen to the music and then learn to play it by learning- by hearing the intervals and things like that	3810	A
i teach uh	3810	A
like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano	3810	A
but he can't learn like that he's a delayed child he's only about	3810	A
i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things	3810	A
and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it	3810	A
uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do something- do something you know educationally	3810	A
so that was really fun my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though	3810	A
so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas	3810	A
um	3810	A
oh i think that's great	3810	A
that's really hard i think because especially if you start them_1 and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something and they go i don't want to do this anymore and you're like	3810	A
God- i really want you to do it you know so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when but	3810	A
i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it	3810	A
uh-huh	3810	A
that's like me	3810	A
well it can get expensive that's for sure	3810	A
i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out	3810	A
yeah so it's been good for our family	3810	A
i don't have any Suzuki students um	3810	A
something happening to me at Christmas time that that verified to me that i will always-	3810	A
oh okay well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing	3810	B
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh Plano Community Orchestra	3810	B
uh just you know different backgrounds it's been really kind of interesting	3810	B
so um	3810	B
oh yeah	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh they did	3810	B
how did	3810	B
how did they get involved in that	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh how fun	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah that's nice you say have your four year old taking lessons already	3810	B
and uh who do you have her or him take it from	3810	B
uh-huh	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
well because_1 my	3810	B
pardon me	3810	B
um-hum um-hum	3810	B
well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of	3810	B
just turning five because_1 she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is	3810	B
is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally she just	3810	B
so i wasn't sure when to start her i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
yeah yeah	3810	B
um-hum um-hum	3810	B
yeah i think she'd like to i just don't know if it's really	3810	B
knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so	3810	B
um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but	3810	B
um so yeah uh so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh that's good	3810	B
well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings from kids who come from a Suzuki method have you had any former Suzuki students	3810	B
i was wondering how they-	3810	B
uh creates some conversation anyway	3824	B
oh no i i think uh i think they're honest i i you know there are some exceptions i think for the majority of them are honest and uh i just think in uh especially in the federal government the thing has just become bigger than	3824	B
both of us all of us and it's just too big to handle and uh i think they look uh	3824	B
they look a lot- fairly incompetent at times and and i just think it's	3824	B
i think they mean well they have good intentions and i as you know as far as the topic goes we as far as i'm concerned they're basically honest people but uh	3824	B
oh	3824	B
oh i don't know what that go ahead go	3824	B
let me get this other thing here hold on a second	3824	B
hello	3824	B
okay i don't know what that was	3824	B
uh no i just think the	3824	B
the uh federal government especially is just so huge i mean problems are so big and uh it's so	3824	B
internationalized that uh i don't know it just i don't know what the solution is but uh i don't think they're in it for their own personal gain uh	3824	B
right	3824	B
well	3824	B
considering that they have to live up there i mean the living conditions up there i mean not the conditions but the private- cost of living is atrocious and uh	3824	B
uh i don't think a lot of them are making uh netting a whole lot of money once they leave up there	3824	B
but uh	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
right and they're just one of uh five hundred and thirty five and you're just talking about the Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
well i think anytime you've got a a Republican administration and a uh oh a so-so senate as far as uh the split between the Democrats and the Republicans and then the democratic uh House uh whoever's in power	3824	B
is going to have their hands full and uh	3824	B
no but uh it's too bad uh but i think it's like a lot of things whether it's a company or an organization of some kind or the goverment- federal government it's uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh	3824	B
you don't have the proper controls in place well then it's going to get out of hand and people are going to look silly kind of foolish foolish and silly when they're uh trying to operate that thing	3824	B
right	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
i know our state government gets a lot of heck as well down here and uh i don't know about of course about states- i don't pay a whole lot of attention to the state government uh we've got a	3824	B
a female governor and she ran against a real clown here a year or so ago and both of them neither- there just wasn't a whole lot to pick from	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
right	3824	B
uh Richards uh Ann Richards is the governor she won then Clayton Williams was the guy that ran against her and he was a west Texas uh rancher and so forth	3824	B
but uh they were both a	3824	B
couple of clowns	3824	B
well they	3824	B
they had a good time it was serious business but i think they enjoyed themselves and a lot of people down here just	3824	B
oh	3824	B
not really she i think uh they she's been in office just about a year now and uh	3824	B
as far as her public uh public opinion surveys i think they give her about a fifty fifty rating she she hasn't uh destroyed the place but the economy down here is in pretty bad shape and she can't do much about that	3824	B
but uh she's she's done okay that who's to say how he would have done he he's a business man he's been successful i i	3824	B
if i had voted i would have voted for him but she's done all right	3824	B
um	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
um	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
she a Republican	3824	B
oh yeah	3824	B
well you	3824	B
um	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
is that right	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
well she's going to have to do	3824	B
yeah yeah so what do you think do you think they're honest or they in for it themselves	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain they're probably	3824	A
they what was that your other line or	3824	A
yeah but they'd probably you know they'd stay in for ten or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a consultant for some of these private industries that	3824	A
okay	3824	A
sure thing	3824	A
it's still me	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah there's actually you know you think you know they get paid what a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand that's really not all that much compared to	3824	A
what	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
no	3824	A
oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty idealist approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is and	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
exactly	3824	A
well you look at even the President you know he's got to fight against all you know the other five hundred thirty five to get anything through anyway so	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah it doesn't	3824	A
not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
exactly	3824	A
yeah and like you say it's	3824	A
you know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing and the do- you know even mouth sometimes are doing- going the opposite direction so	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah well there was that was a lot of that was public- quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that Richards wasn't that her name	3824	A
gal that won	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
so are they doing any good is she doing any good or	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah did we just uh we got our first woman mayor up here in Salt Lake uh just this past election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but she's a business woman and that's what she was really pushing was	3824	A
business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because	3824	A
you know she's kind of a self-made i don't know if she's a millionaire but she you know got her own businesses and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so	3824	A
uh no she's Democrat	3824	A
which uh	3824	A
actually Salt Lake and the county around Salt Lake is quite a bit Democrat so it's not really surprising we've had a a a Democratic mayor for quite a few years	3824	A
uh the state as a whole is probably more definitely more Republican but	3824	A
yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's	3824	A
she's already stepped on a few toes i think she's making the changes but	3824	A
well	3821	A
credit cards	3821	A
i'll tell you what i i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because_1	3821	A
i uh tore mine up	3821	A
yeah uh i got in some problems with uh	3821	A
financial problems because of credit cards so i	3821	A
uh basically just got rid of all of them i i have a a couple i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and	3821	A
you know uh one that i use just for	3821	A
emergencies but	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
i know it	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
oh is that right that's a that's a good policy	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
yeah uh sometimes i wish i had them but in most cases i'm glad i don't because_1 i you know unfortunately i i-	3821	A
i don't have the control you have i wish i did but but i don't uh and it you know it i just don't want to get into that situation again so we'll	3821	A
oh that's it see and that's even with my gas card you know i find that i'll go in to get some gas and i'll end up buying you know	3821	A
candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and i'm thinking what did i get	3821	A
that costs so much	3821	A
and	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
that that's true but i can i can understand- certainly understand where	3821	A
you know	3821	A
oh yeah isn't it that's unbelievable how let me ask you this how how old are you	3821	A
thirty three	3821	A
okay	3821	A
you'll be thirty three this year	3821	A
you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh	3821	A
it's coming	3821	A
yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates it's uh it's unbelievable	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
oh jeez	3821	A
yeah and then you bet	3821	A
that's uh yeah i in fact i've i've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less	3821	A
uh rates	3821	A
and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know	3821	A
and i i guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh	3821	A
call you know if you've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating	3821	A
you can call your in you know your your card uh wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or i'll just go to somewhere else	3821	A
you know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good uh	3821	A
uh history with them	3821	A
they're more than willing to do that	3821	A
yeah in fact that's that's what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says that's you know he's tried it several- with several of his cards and he's just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank	3821	A
at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent	3821	A
it does not make sense for me to do that and if you won't drop my rates i'll just go ahead and send you back your card and i'll go somewhere else and get it	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
yeah	3821	B
is that right i i know people- i know some other people that have done that	3821	B
um	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
yeah i have- i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were	3821	B
they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies and	3821	B
they're still paying away to get out of debt	3821	B
but	3821	B
no i did just the opposite i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh	3821	B
parents' footsteps i have quite a few of them i use them continually	3821	B
but i uh i basically never charge anything i don't have the money in the bank to pay for	3821	B
and uh and i always pay them off totally every month yeah	3821	B
yeah and it you know i mean they they're just a convenience for me i don't have to get cash out of the bank and i don't have to to be writing checks and and uh	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
yeah uh-huh	3821	B
yeah i mean it it's easy i mean you- you know you don't have anything transferring just a little signature so what you know	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
right	3821	B
surprising	3821	B
yeah well you know but the i mean there are sort some inherent limits there you're not going to you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that right	3821	B
now i with- the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know not so much discipline i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly	3821	B
that i	3821	B
i'm uh thirty three	3821	B
thirty two excuse me	3821	B
yeah	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
you know i just that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest and and my wife recently uh	3821	B
decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off and she's from there and and uh didn't really have the money but you know she could pay it off and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards but she's paying it and uh	3821	B
i just won't do it i mean she's paying i don't know i don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money i'll go to the bank and uh	3821	B
oh yeah	3821	B
right	3821	B
right	3821	B
yeah	3821	B
right	3821	B
huh	3821	B
well i might	3821	B
um	3821	B
right	3821	B
hum i might try that because i i have one card that i've had for about uh	3821	B
i don't know nine or ten years	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
right	3821	B
yeah for me the big thing you know is the uh uh	3821	B
is the uh the annual fee and i just refuse i won't get any card now i've i've got a good rating and i've got you know and i'm not going i'm not going to pay an annual fee the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first	3821	B
something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didn't uh get too much built up on it that we didn't know it was out there but	3180	A
we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable	3180	A
uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off	3180	A
uh	3180	A
right	3180	A
yeah it's it's strange that that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine	3180	A
i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because	3180	A
that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent	3180	A
right	3180	A
the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of your- all your purchases back	3180	A
but they had a uh a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee	3180	A
if you use it at a uh	3180	A
a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so that would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh	3180	A
that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i- i hardly i never have that i know of	3180	A
um-hum	3180	A
yep	3180	A
and if you happen to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh	3180	A
the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's there's several opportunities to use the uh	3180	A
card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around	3180	A
and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them_1	3180	A
i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i- i guess i	3180	A
i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had	3180	A
hum	3180	A
yeah	3180	A
i guess that's the way they	3180	A
planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to uh	3180	A
i do seem to recall	3180	A
uh	3180	A
oh i- i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh	3180	A
gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places- places were closed it was after hours as it were and	3180	A
there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open	3180	A
which which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card	3180	B
yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have	3180	B
you know eighteen percent some of them_1 even higher	3180	B
and uh uh you know it it's some of them are almost uh usurious	3180	B
so	3180	B
right	3180	B
yeah it's like my uh ATM card	3180	B
if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and it's down in the lobby i've got a these automatic teller machines then it's very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there	3180	B
but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars	3180	B
for that transaction which i thought gosh	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash	3180	B
yeah that's- well that's that's not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that	3180	B
when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me	3180	B
and uh	3180	B
uh	3180	B
you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money before it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card	3180	B
uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been uh quite so expensive	3180	B
and hello there so i guess the question is do you have any pets what do you have	3122	A
a cat named	3122	A
Bounce	3122	A
Bounce the third okay	3122	A
and the name stuck with you	3122	A
okay	3122	A
very good	3122	A
a rabbit	3122	A
and i assume that now the rabbit doesn't get out right the rabbit's in in the cage okay	3122	A
one- now do you just have one rabbit in other words it never multiplies okay	3122	A
well i've i've had uh i had three Cocker Spaniels uh up until about	3122	A
um four or five- i guess about four years ago and they they were all very old twelve thirteen and fourteen- fifteen and they died and but i believe the a child must have a	3122	A
pet to grow up with so on my uh kid's fourth birthday his birthday present was a Basset Hound	3122	A
which as he calls it a basket hound but that's okay yes but uh anyway so yes we have the Basset Hound who is now two years old and in fact it just had the lovely uh	3122	A
yesterday i got to take the dog to the veterinarian for his shots	3122	A
that's one of the uh to me one of the things i don't care about having a pet about	3122	A
no he's an outdoor dog uh he's a very low maintenance dog uh we actually have a uh an automatic feeder and we have an automatic waterer so he always has plenty of water	3122	A
so i don't have to worry about going out there and like for example i'm going on this two week vacation he'll be fine	3122	A
no one even has to look after him although we have a neighbor who's going to come over you know say hello just to keep him happy but uh	3122	A
he's in a very well fenced backyard that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and chase the kids and he likes that	3122	A
claw	3122	A
now has it been declawed	3122	A
it has not oh you should	3122	A
have you ever thought of having it	3122	A
okay okay	3122	A
true true true	3122	A
now my wife would very much like to have a cat because_1 she she grew up with a cat then uh the cat lived indoors and the whole bit i just don't care for cats i don't know what it is about it but she- i guess because	3122	A
yes they are	3122	A
you can't say come here i mean it just doesn't you know	3122	A
hum	3122	A
well we have a humongous uh our back what do you call it the uh living room has nothing but	3122	A
one big window after another so it's all windows and we can look out in the backyard and we're always seeing the dog and the dog you know he's	3122	A
he he knows when we're in the room because when we're in the room and just come- walking down the hall whatnot he'll come and and look at us you know we'll wave at him he'll come back to you you know yeah	3122	A
yes he is he's very- most loving dog you've ever had i can't i can't really i cannot imagine not having a dog	3122	A
well what you have to do is have an indoor dog	3122	A
and they can be very nice too after- after they've been trained	3122	A
and they do require a lot of training	3122	A
now my dog he you know we've got him trained that we could bring him inside but once we bought the new house my wife said uh-huh no no he's not coming inside this house so	3122	A
um-hum	3122	A
and they do get the carpet uh soiled sometimes-	3122	A
yes	3122	A
well i tell you what i've got some uh carpet uh cleaner that uh you know it's some type of dog smell- smell away it works wonderful it really really does	3122	A
oh	3122	A
oh come on	3122	A
now this is from a cat or a dog	3122	A
okay	3122	A
because_1 yes dogs need training but cats usually don't even need any training seem like they automatically go to their little litter box they think yeah	3122	A
well in fact if we're getting ready to go on our vacation my little six year old now he's saying we need to buy a mother dog to take care of uh	3122	A
Copper while we're gone i said you don't buy mother dogs you buy little puppies	3122	A
and- and and my wife's saying uh-huh no	3122	A
well we had three at one time we had three in the backyard all at one time- and they played they also humped on each other all the time but you know they	3122	A
oh they did	3122	A
although i'll tell you what it really would scare me like now in the summer when this hot uh when they're playing that hard i you know it's i'm not sure if that was that good for them_1 or not	3122	A
but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a	3122	A
the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside and he is constantly chasing the kids and people walk in our neighborhood he's always and we're on the corner too so you know he has a lot of traffic going by and he	3122	A
hi	3122	B
yes we well we have a cat yes named Bounce actually it's Bounce the uh about third	3122	B
yeah uh that's because when i was little i had a storybook about a cat named Bounce and	3122	B
and the cat was um gray and white in particular had to be gray and white so all the Bounces have been gray and white we also have a rabbit	3122	B
named Coco Bunny	3122	B
right the rabbit is in a cage outdoors only year round	3122	B
one rabbit	3122	B
No that's for sure and uh that's actually all the pets we have at this time	3122	B
how about you	3122	B
um hum um-hum	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
right	3122	B
oh	3122	B
oh yeah cute	3122	B
uh-huh	3122	B
oh boy	3122	B
did-	3122	B
right yeah does he live indoors or outdoors- outdoor yeah that's kind of	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
um	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
ooh how nice	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
he's just in the fenced backyard and	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
well how nice	3122	B
yeah that sounds like a good situation that's about how i would like to have a dog if i had a dog	3122	B
see our cat is also um well outdoors and in the garage	3122	B
at one time she was an indoor cat and then she started to do things in the house that i didn't appreciate	3122	B
no no no no well-	3122	B
well no because_1 she's outdoors	3122	B
so if she's outdoors i don't want her declawed	3122	B
um but she um she was kind of a feisty- feisty- feisty little character when she was little and as she has gotten older because_1 she's about seven years old	3122	B
would she	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
yeah well they're so independent a lot of people don't i	3122	B
that's true it could just stand there and stare at you in a strange way in fact my cat right now is just rubbing up against the the wood on the door here staring-	3122	B
with a look of don't you want	3122	B
to feed me or to pick me up and love me <b_aside> yes you sweet thing <e_aside>	3122	B
um-hum um-hum	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
so he is sociable even though he even though he's outdoors yeah	3122	B
yeah my boys and um my husband have been talking recently about having a dog but we don't have a a fenced in backyard	3122	B
and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park	3122	B
and we just you know one reason we	3122	B
yeah i guess it would have to be and we	3122	B
yeah that's true	3122	B
yeah well that's right	3122	B
yeah yeah that's for sure	3122	B
uh-hum um well pets	3122	B
pets really are hard on houses i mean there's just no doubt about that we've my husband was in really estate for a while and	3122	B
you know he had more problems over pets um in both rental houses and houses that people owned and other people looked at it and didn't like the way it smelled and so so that's my main	3122	B
objection	3122	B
yeah i mean even- even the best trained one you know is going to have problems from time to time and you just can't really get that that smell out and	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
well that's good when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it and um we did not realize that there was a problem and after we moved in it was	3122	B
so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house	3122	B
and uh when they pulled the carpeting up it was so bad on the back there were so many spots you just wouldn't believe and um they- they we had to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete slab	3122	B
and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then got- took took that well actually both	3122	B
that- um took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that and we had to stay out of the house for	3122	B
you know ten hours or something and then we came back and then they put the new carpet down there moved the furniture back to that half of the house and had- had to do it again	3122	B
yeah no they usually don't yeah yeah so anyway we've had that that was a very bad experience well i don't really think we're going to have any more indoor pets	3122	B
so they'd have company right well it really is fun to have two pets together um-hum yeah	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
yeah but they must really have fun together it it's cute to see several- several at a time like that	3122	B
oh yeah	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
just the kids	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army	3104	B
oh lord	3104	B
that is an army i came from a family of six	3104	B
and i have only got two and they're one	3104	B
well i kind of decided that single single children that that	3104	B
that's not parenting that's a hobby but	3104	B
well don't tell that to all my friends	3104	B
they're into quality time i'm just into getting through the day	3104	B
well i- i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people's kids you know when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids	3104	B
that are usually in day care and you can spot them because_1 they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around	3104	B
yeah really	3104	B
it's not a problem for my two they're only eighteen months apart	3104	B
they can	3104	B
they can find things to do and mess around and and	3104	B
plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college	3104	B
well how did you go about selecting a college then	3104	B
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
how about_1 the other four other three who went	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
yeah i was i was making more than i was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired	3104	B
yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really	3104	B
there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there	3104	B
i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit um	3104	B
my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known	3104	B
how not i'm not going to say easy but how	3104	B
much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh	3104	B
scholarship to go anyplace else i think that i	3104	B
would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was	3104	B
taken out of my element you know the the the homogeneous Midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh	3104	B
different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me	3104	B
now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could	3104	B
i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already uh but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to	3104	B
you know them getting an education they really need a a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and uh	3104	B
an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you	3104	B
it's very different	3104	B
you shouldn't	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
oh yeah	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
uh well let's see	3104	A
five	3104	A
well any number is nice let me tell you	3104	A
yeah it's not as fair to the children either i don't think	3104	A
oh	3104	A
yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
you can tell	3104	A
how to just entertain themselves	3104	A
yeah yeah	3104	A
it's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being	3104	A
uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference	3104	A
uh keeps you busy	3104	A
yeah	3104	A
well that's great	3104	A
no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and	3104	A
well we didn't do it right all the time with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh	3104	A
right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in uh and take what they're interested in and then then start looking for schools	3104	A
no not necessarily	3104	A
and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Reynolds- Riddle and we talked him into going local here first	3104	A
and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that	3104	A
uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally	3104	A
and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines	3104	A
uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didn't want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess	3104	A
uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion	3104	A
because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted	3104	A
and our other uh two boys they went to Clarion also and uh did very well there	3104	A
and they've all really got uh	3104	A
they've all really got really good jobs	3104	A
and uh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college	3104	A
she said i- i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody	3104	A
but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life	3104	A
because if they get an education	3104	A
and are willing to go where the jobs are	3104	A
they can make a you know a much better income	3104	A
like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state	3104	A
you know that boggles my mind	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
okay did you go to college	3104	A
you did see it it makes a difference	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
uh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
someplace else	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
that's great	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
different life styles yes yeah	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
right	3104	A
it's quite a bit different	3104	A
see that's the way we are we're more of a rural type of a area	3104	A
and it does make a difference	3104	A
i they say you shouldn't look at the expense of the college when you are looking	3104	A
yeah not really because they say a lot of times you -can get more help	3104	A
with a more expensive college	3104	A
and so in the long run if it's really what they want	3104	A
you know they're better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school uh we we did all we could	3104	A
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go	3104	A
okay we're on	3114	A
so uh you're you're for no restrictions or	3114	A
uh-huh	3114	A
yeah	3114	A
right	3114	A
i what kind- what what kind of means would those be	3114	A
uh-huh in other words you're saying that it would be hard uh to get rid of all of the guns	3114	A
well doesn't it doesn't doesn't London have a ban on firearms	3114	A
England	3114	A
yeah don't they carry don't their policemen over there carry these billy clubs	3114	A
yeah	3114	A
well it would be nice uh uh to be able to take your family out uh especially when they're dependent on you and not worry about uh having to have a gun just to protect yourself and them	3114	A
well i have a couple of guns and uh one i always worry about somebody getting ahold of it that that you know won't know how to handle it	3114	A
and uh probably never will do me any good because_1 the bullets in one place and the firearm's in another	3114	A
and i carry one in the pickup uh and i worry about it being stolen and uh of course i'm like you i don't like to kill things	3114	A
so	3114	A
oh yeah and and there's a lot-	3114	A
the crazies are out there in numbers	3114	A
well you know i would love to see a ban uh on firearms and i'd have to rate myself as a number one however i worry that that the that the country could ever get to that point	3114	A
and then i worry about uh the fact that uh what if there was some sort of insurrection in this country- in this country	3114	A
then uh how would we as citizens uh band together and ever put down an uprising if there were no firearms	3114	A
i don't think we ever will	3114	A
yeah so somewhere- somewhere along the line then uh you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh oh what's the organization that uh	3114	A
that the rifle association	3114	A
the gun- the uh the gun association is is heavily for no bans whatsoever	3114	A
yeah well i think so too so i'd have to vote for uh uh maybe a five in uh and hopefully uh we could put some sort of restriction on the handling of firearms	3114	A
like like you suggested	3114	A
okay Betty well sounds good enough to me then	3114	A
well same here and uh one of these days that name's gonna come back to me	3114	A
okay sweetheart bye-bye	3114	A
okay well i just on on gun control i just always felt like that i think	3114	B
i don't think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that person out um	3114	B
i don't believe that most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe it's probably	3114	B
bought across the market and i don't think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all	3114	B
uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say	3114	B
if a criminal- if a criminal should go happen to go into a gun store i don't think it would hurt anybody to wait a week	3114	B
to go back and pick up that gun so that they can check them out	3114	B
and if it is somebody like that then no but i really think that most of the criminals in our city who have guns do not go into a gun store and buy them i think they get them_1 from other means	3114	B
oh i don't know like from each other you know uh	3114	B
i think so	3114	B
jeez now i don't know	3114	B
that's right nobody over there carries guns	3114	B
i don't know if we could get away with guns completely i guess	3114	B
that's right i agree with that i agree with that i we do not own one um	3114	B
and i don't intend to buy one and i'm not a hunter i guess those people feel a little bit different but i don't believe in hunting either so you know	3114	B
right	3114	B
uh-huh	3114	B
no i don't either well it is terrible when you have to ride down the street and think somebody could just shoot at you for nothing which has been in the news a lot lately you know no apparent reason	3114	B
right right	3114	B
hm	3114	B
yeah	3114	B
uprising	3114	B
you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms	3114	B
i don't either that's the problem not in this country	3114	B
right	3114	B
oh yes	3114	B
yeah well i think we ought to have some	3114	B
right i could go for that	3114	B
yeah i think that would i think that's the only way	3114	B
well	3114	B
i've enjoyed talking to you	3114	B
oh me- me too okay bye-bye	3114	B
right right	3183	A
i have been well i go quite a bit i travel about_1 forty percent of my time but my vacations my favorite spot is Las Vegas yeah	3183	A
really i are there any particular reason you're not into gambling or	3183	A
i see	3183	A
oh really in France	3183	A
yes	3183	A
uh-huh	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
no uh my in-laws have and i i stay- stay steer away from boats as much as possible only because i can't take it	3183	A
really	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
right right exactly	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
i yes everything i see that they brought back it i- i definitely agree	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
really	3183	A
oh yes yes	3183	A
i it's it cruises from what i understand are are really the way to go and someday- someday i will convince my or convince myself that i can handle it and i will surprise my wife and and book a cruise uh i	3183	A
much definitely prefer warmer climates than Alaska so i would probably head for the Caribbean	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
i've used those right	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
interesting interesting- i never i really never thought of that that's pretty good to know	3183	A
um-hum yeah	3183	A
yeah and this is one spot you know being in Ohio the New England states are not that far uh that is one thing that really has not interested us we do like the Virginias the Carolinas Carolina	3183	A
oh yes several times	3183	A
yeah and uh we next week we're leaving for New Orleans and i'm i i do prefer the warmer the warmer	3183	A
um-hum but uh and i loved Hawaii	3183	A
uh we had bought	3183	A
really it it's it's uh it's just beautiful i just	3183	A
i would be very happy staying in Hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isn't too far off which is something i might wanna consider but uh	3183	A
i you know i've i've been tempted i've gotten down as far as San Antonio but i've never gone down to uh really to the coastline	3183	A
yeah so	3183	A
uh-huh	3183	A
i love it yes i that	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
yes it is and you have to do that uh people that go and they only go to one area you have to see it all	3183	A
yes very good well it's nice talking to you okay um-hum bye-bye	3183	A
well we're gonna be talking about vacations i guess huh where have you been recently	3183	B
Las Vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting man- i've been there one time and i'll be honest i did not enjoy it no no	3183	B
i- i guess just because i'm not that type of a person i'm i'm a CPA and i i'm very conservative with my money and i just did to me that was not a vacation	3183	B
uh i now i'm a big world traveler i enjoy traveling the world i just got back from Hawaii uh this past July uh the prior year before that i'd been to uh Tokyo Disneyland	3183	B
uh i've been i've got a trip coming up next year i'm going to the EuroDisney	3183	B
uh that's gonna be in Paris France we're going there in July	3183	B
and at the same time we're also gonna go visit Norway i've always wanted to go see the Fjords of Norway i just love have- have- have you ever been on a cruise to um Alaska	3183	B
okay	3183	B
well i tell you what if i possibly can uh there's a spot that i would love to encourage you to go visit	3183	B
my father same way	3183	B
he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i don't like it	3183	B
the thing that is so wonderful about the Alaskan cruise it is on what they call the inside passage	3183	B
you're not in the ocean you are in a river almost	3183	B
only- only the only thing you have are cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right side and we're talking about five hundred foot thousand foot cliffs	3183	B
absolutely gorgeous and-	3183	B
and- and- and- and every yeah and every thirty yards here comes another uh waterfall which is nothing more than the melting snow	3183	B
that's just more glorious than the last one it is absolutely fantastic and with those cliffs the sunsets are just oh my goodness uh	3183	B
for me and my wife it was probably the most romantic one week trip i have ever ever taken	3183	B
and the food the food on we were on uh Princess Cruise Lines and the food was just out of this world	3183	B
well if that be the case-	3183	B
i was gonna say you can go to the Caribbean but the now the problem with the Caribbean though now you've got the ocean and i've been to the Caribbean three times now you got the ocean and if you have a motion sickness problem now they have these little patches you can put behind your ear	3183	B
uh you'd wanna use those but the same time though you- you're not going to get as pleasant of a ride as you would on that Alaskan cruise	3183	B
uh but and and and there there are parts especially when you get close to Cuba there are the water can get very very rough	3183	B
really can but uh otherwise as far as vacation i've i've course i see i guess i like the cold weather i i've been up to New England and i thought that was fantastic	3183	B
um	3183	B
now	3183	B
oh have you have you been on the Blue Ridge Parkway oh wow now that's fantastic	3183	B
see i'm a Louisiana boy so i know where you're talking about_1 there	3183	B
yes now that was my first trip i've ever been to Hawaii yes	3183	B
well stay away from the Texas coastlines Texas doesn't have anything for you	3183	B
yeah	3183	B
the the coastline yeah the coastline here is the pits uh there's- there's much better in Florida much much better uh other places Hawaii was wonderful that was great	3183	B
uh i thought Waikiki Beach was as nice of a of a beach as i ever wanna see and we went to four different islands we had a great time	3183	B
well tell you what i've got a i've got a phone ringing on the other line i better go answer it i've enjoyed talking to you though catch you later bye-bye	3183	B
well uh i agree that they have problems but i- i'm afraid i'm very much against universal health um my daughter is uh	3153	B
uh stationed in England right now and of course you know they've had uh group health uh over there for some time um	3153	B
i was over there last- uh a year ago when my granddaughter was born	3153	B
and uh she had some problems and uh i was horrified from beginning to end first of all they are about fifty years behind	3153	B
they don't have and their medical technology the doctors since they aren't responsible really to each patient don't feel they have to sit down and talk to you about the problems	3153	B
when they want to do something to a patient whether the patient is a few days old or eighty or ninety they do it they don't ask permission	3153	B
my daughter went um upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didn't even know they were going to do surgery on the baby uh	3153	B
yes it was it was really terrible that's why i went over there i mean she was she cried she called and was you know really you know upset um the day we were leaving the hospital finally	3153	B
um we were getting all ready to go home and finally you know the baby was okay and everything was fine and the doctor that had been working with her poked his head in the door and he said by the way he said in six weeks he want you to come back uh	3153	B
for a test- uh uh a test that we want to do on on her um for uh uh	3153	B
multiple sclerosis	3153	B
and he turned around and left	3153	B
and we just kind of looked at each other and said what	3153	B
uh for what and i i tried for fifteen minutes to find the doctor and he was unavailable	3153	B
well the the thing is these are the HMO's that they have now which are cheaper and you can in my daughter- my other daughter belongs to an HMO or they used to thankfully they've just changed um you don't	3153	B
you only get a choice of doctors that are in your area not necessarily of doctors that are good or not uh see i i've worked for i worked for Johns Hopkins for two years	3153	B
uh at the hospital there and i've worked for a private doctor for two years and um	3153	B
get him out of there she said well he hasn't done anything wrong it's just that he has poor judgment and i thought oh gosh i mean you're the doctor telling you this you know um	3153	B
some horror stories like that but then when with the HMO um the they sent her to a pediatrician that had one gentleman that was uh	3153	B
uh in his late seventies	3153	B
and an Indian doctor that she couldn't understand and that had no patience with children	3153	B
and you know it was kind of that was kind of a bad experience too so when they changed she finally got	3153	B
you know a good pediatrician but uh uh it it it's	3153	B
it's just a little scary when you don't have as much when you can't just go say hey here's a good doctor i'm going to go to this doctor you know um	3153	B
and i i fear that the doctors are going to not be as you know right now they're in a lot of fierce competition so they they keep up to date you know at least most of them the good ones	3153	B
um i- i i don't know i just fear that uh that it may go downhill if we do indeed you know change to something like that uh	3153	B
no it doesn't uh also	3153	B
uh we uh my husband was a civilian but we were uh stationed overseas for a while and so i had to go to	3153	B
myself and the children had to go do military doctors huh wow now that's another story you know so but it's the same	3153	B
same thing i mean these doctors didn't want to be here okay they were fulfilling their military obligations and you know they uh of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they uh	3153	B
well enjoy the field but um the- i have found	3153	B
uh through people that i know that have HMO's that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking	3153	B
i mean not speaking but like Indian doctors you can't understand them because of their their um uh accent	3153	B
uh or uh Chinese or and i have nothing against them in fact i went to a doctor for years that was a Chinese doctor but i could understand what he was saying	3153	B
you know so i just it just this is a bad subject for me to be on only because i've had some real bad experiences and i've known some people that have uh	3153	B
been	3153	B
right well i'll tell you now what you do	3153	B
is you go uh to the doctors and just meet them	3153	B
and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you give him	3153	B
i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um uh if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that uh	3153	B
is uh uh	3153	B
is usually pretty good but uh uh you know you- i'd try him out	3153	B
yeah oh it should- okay see that's it	3153	B
yeah so that's see that's what scares me about going into universal health	3153	B
okay i mean you could you could really be in serious trouble if you wait to see one of the ones that you feel are better if uh uh you know if we went to that and that was all there was	3153	B
um uh	3153	B
oh well they don't it would it would still be like it is now um the ones in your area	3153	B
you know and that would be closest to where you live uh and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume um	3153	B
but uh but also now in England how they work it is you go to see a regular MD	3153	B
if he determines that it's necessary then he'll send you to a gynecologist or a surgeon or you know you can't just go there	3153	B
uh	3153	B
yes	3153	B
um-hum	3153	B
yep	3153	B
um hum	3153	B
that's right and uh i mean you know that could potentially be um	3153	B
rather	3153	B
all right um how do you feel about the health insurance problems	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
wow	3153	A
oh my God what a terrible thing for her to go through	3153	A
ah	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
right	3153	A
right	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
oh	3153	A
ah	3153	A
right	3153	A
that doesn't give any incentive	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
i guess so	3153	A
i just joined an HMO i just got a new job and i haven't heard i haven't been i haven't even actually paid for it or actually started my coverage yet but that's what they have is HMO and	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
well what they told me at at work they told me that uh	3153	A
so	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
how would they decide who get's which doctor	3153	A
oh i see local	3153	A
right that the same for the HMO and and because the doctors work for the HMO the people i work with are telling me you know HMO's are great if you're generally healthy	3153	A
and you just go for the checkup every year or whatever it's just three dollars but if you have a problem then it's real hard to get the doctor to refer you to a specialist because they're told you know not to because_1 it cost the HMO money	3153	A
all right and and your occupation is teaching	3115	A
substitute teacher	3115	A
yes it is it is uh-huh	3115	A
right well i was just trying to make an introduction here	3115	A
but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now	3115	A
i've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron	3115	A
right i well not really i've got the every day i've got to uh read to kindergartners so i'm going to be down on the floor with them i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day	3115	A
for uh you know a half hour so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do	3115	A
because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses	3115	A
right	3115	A
well of course you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold	3115	A
but you don't know uh	3115	A
i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there	3115	A
subtract right	3115	A
i i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools that's one of things one of the things i ask about	3115	A
you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing	3115	A
and and i said well you know that was okay and i'm basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in the winter you know i just add a	3115	A
maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer	3115	A
that's about	3115	A
i don't i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and	3115	A
you know look really	3115	A
yeah	3115	A
right right	3115	A
and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you	3115	A
right right	3115	A
right on what Thursday- Thursday	3115	A
right right so that would kind of give you	3115	A
a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time	3115	A
of what's going on that so that's	3115	A
and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they gonna put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties	3115	A
and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh	3115	A
dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top and and uh	3115	A
i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they can- have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
right right right	3115	A
yeah there- there's a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others right	3115	A
right	3115	A
well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there	3115	A
there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if uh that teaches health or	3115	A
English- you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie i some of those male coaches that might really	3115	A
right and a T-shirt	3115	A
right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so	3115	A
whether	3115	A
change then well see that's what i would think	3115	A
that's what i would think	3115	A
right	3115	A
course we had had one coach one period he'd teach PE and the next period Health and then a period of PE and and that's hard you know so he just left warm-ups on but	3115	A
but uh no i think really probably they could they could uh	3115	A
really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and	3115	A
you don't think so	3115	A
well some of them yes they do and and it's not at some of the private schools but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
well i i think it would make a difference at school i i don't think we should be spending time	3115	A
saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts- too shorts too short or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know i mean	3115	A
it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we can't to that either i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear	3115	A
a button down shirt you know that would that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks	3115	A
and they could buy them anywhere they wanted and you know and	3115	A
and then the girls could	3115	A
right i don't no not in Plano	3115	A
they may get away- but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there	3115	A
Highland Park's thinking about going that route	3115	A
so it	3115	A
and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do	3115	A
yeah i agree with you on	3115	A
i'm a substitute- i'm a substitute teacher is is this Pat i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in	3115	B
oh okay	3115	B
oh	3115	B
well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that	3115	B
well	3115	B
what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater	3115	B
yes	3115	B
you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off	3115	B
and it's it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual	3115	B
uh	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
right and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week	3115	B
and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some	3115	B
sort of hat	3115	B
no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many schools on a particular day during uh	3115	B
i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which	3115	B
right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools	3115	B
yeah	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think	3115	B
but it i think it varies it it just so much anything anything can go	3115	B
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they're all pretty fancy	3115	B
but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other departments that aren't and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might	3115	B
might say	3115	B
right	3115	B
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them	3115	B
or you're going to be observed	3115	B
yeah	3115	B
right they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants	3115	B
yeah well at Vines the coaches don't do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
but they they don't look you know they don't wear their sweat pants or or anything they're they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in PE	3115	B
those i can understand yeah	3115	B
i don't think we'll ever get to that uh no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times- they've had uniforms for years i really- don't really know if they still do	3115	B
it certainly makes it easier to dress	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
yeah but i doubt that that would come about- that that will come about just i yeah i i i	3115	B
no not yeah	3115	B
well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but	3115	B
yeah	3129	A
exactly	3129	A
oh	3129	A
did- did- did you do the diagnosis or- or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
yeah i know uh when working with the uh flashers	3129	A
there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam	3129	A
diagram	3129	A
yeah i don't even know if my uh current cars have a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are uh	3129	A
things running uh while they're at the same unit like the little- the headlamp	3129	A
you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam uh requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse	3129	A
so that's a possibility	3129	A
is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for uh old imports	3129	A
who-	3129	A
um so it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that	3129	A
yeah have you found any uh uh reliable import service people in the metroplex	3129	A
oh yeah	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
i'll be darned	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
oh my goodness	3129	A
oh no	3129	A
well ours wasn't within the last year i guess it's been within the last two years uh	3129	A
Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new and it's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh	3129	A
i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort	3129	A
and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems it was	3129	A
idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that uh we park on a on a hill under our car port and	3129	A
when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you	3129	A
and the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit	3129	A
so we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place	3129	A
and asked them to check it out and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again	3129	A
i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around but the	3129	A
second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their uh service reports from region or headquarters whatever and	3129	A
and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part	3129	A
and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine	3129	A
for a a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don't- we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven	3129	A
well Tom just tonight i was working on my car out of necessity and i had uh	3129	B
uh had a long age old problem of my bright lights not working uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column	3129	B
and when i would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely	3129	B
which is even worse than them just not getting bright	3129	B
and i had to presume that it was the switch and uh this is uh an older car it's a seventy two MG	3129	B
so i had to mail order the part uh which i had done and tonight i went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch	3129	B
so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh and hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used	3129	B
uh i had	3129	B
done what diagnosis i could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car	3129	B
and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem i talked to one mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also	3129	B
uh but i've not you know i really don't know what the problem might be it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard	3129	B
uh it might be tied into the equation somehow	3129	B
but uh	3129	B
i i don't know i should look at that i don't remember seeing one in the uh	3129	B
in the the diagram but i'll have to go back and look at that	3129	B
uh-huh	3129	B
yeah that's a good idea	3129	B
what i've typically found when that uh companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all and i hope that that's the case this time	3129	B
right exactly it's out of uh Kansas	3129	B
somewhere	3129	B
no it's not i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car but uh it is not either it's uh obviously doesn't quite fit	3129	B
so it must be for a different year	3129	B
so i'll have to try to return that as well	3129	B
well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car because i've owned this car since it was new	3129	B
and uh but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area	3129	B
and i hadn't used him for some years and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of uh all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh German cars and	3129	B
German cars i'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on British cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it	3129	B
so uh uh i may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work so i'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out	3129	B
i've not had to- to exchange any other parts recently uh	3129	B
because they were defective now i've had had pretty good luck i just however did uh have to get a	3129	B
a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players	3129	B
uh repaired i'd purchased it at at Sam's and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty and i should have checked more carefully and and done a better job of saving the receipt	3129	B
because uh i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by uh some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play	3129	B
and as it turned out it had a full year's warranty and i could have gotten it repaired for free but i i had to to take it in while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost	3129	B
uh but it didn't do me any good because i had i had missed the window by about a week or two so i didn't even i didn't really uh even bring it up when i went in to pick it up	3129	B
but uh that's really my only experience in the past year where i've had to take a product back because of a defect	3129	B
good grief	3129	B
uh-huh	3129	B
huh	3129	B
my goodness	3129	B
huh	3129	B
yeah	3144	B
well uh it's funny when i tried to make the call the other days i thought i hadn't seen anything since Dances With Wolves but today i went to see Regarding With Henry	3144	B
it was really good we uh Jeff Warner just got out of the hospital and uh Jeff and Deanna went and	3144	B
another friend in the neighborhood and uh we all liked it we had uh both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and everyone enjoyed it and uh	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston uh	3144	B
and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought well i want to see this one too so we uh i finally it's my first summer movie	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
oh was that good	3144	B
uh well i want to see that and City Slickers both i love comedies but that's what i was	3144	B
oh was it	3144	B
oh	3144	B
oh well good i'm i'm glad to hear that because they	3144	B
uh-huh	3144	B
well i don't i don't know if you got to see Weekend um At Bernie's that was out a couple of year's ago they had a free showing at the Berkeley um United Artist	3144	B
and i don't know who was here or whether Jay just called a friend and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we'd try it you know free movie	3144	B
it was so funny and it sounds like uh what you were just describing Soapdish too i mean we just we hurt by the time we came out and the whole theater was hysterical and it's just it's just goofy i mean it's	3144	B
uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on TV i would think	3144	B
um because_1 it's it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way Soapdish was but with everyone laughing	3144	B
well i'm glad you did that before your surgery	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
oh gosh	3144	B
oh	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
yeah yeah	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
no that was one uh Jay got to see with a friend and so i i- and to try and uh	3144	B
try and find time it's hard uh	3144	B
with Jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go and	3144	B
um i'm holding out for City Slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group and because i think he he needs a comedy too um	3144	B
uh and that's what he would have liked to have seen Regarding Henry too but knew that	3144	B
uh we've we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful we're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing uh	3144	B
there's just not a time enough time to do it all and he said well realistically you know he knew he couldn't get them all in but uh Jay really liked Robin Hood um	3144	B
when the choir group went to see Backdraft and they thought that was uh	3144	B
it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know aren't real big but the the fire scenes and the drafts- you know that action part is fantastic	3144	B
but he thought Robin Hood was great it was real different then you'd expect but he- but he enjoyed it and so	3144	B
yeah me too and yeah i really uh like him a lot which is why Dances With Wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months but it was i uh	3144	B
in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again because_1 we really wanted him to see it too	3144	B
uh	3144	B
i just thought that was terrific and i really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see	3144	B
and he's very good in Regarding Henry that's not an easy part to play i i don't think	3144	B
yeah that's at that one won't hurt your sides um it was this the first time you got to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians	3144	B
uh-huh	3144	B
you ready okay what have you seen lately	3144	A
oh i'm dying to see that	3144	A
oh	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
oh my goodness	3144	A
oh well i am just dying to see it i went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a babysitter and we'll all go see Regarding Henry and i said ooh i want to see it so bad	3144	A
oh	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
oh my well let me see was it well we went to see One Hundred And One Dalmatians last weekend and that may be	3144	A
no right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on we're going to the movies and we won't well she goes all the time but i go maybe once every couple of months	3144	A
and when i go i go see two at a time so we went to see Soapdish	3144	A
and oh hysterical we laughed so hard it was just you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard	3144	A
yeah that's the other one that we went to see that night	3144	A
and my face hurt so bad from laughing because i love Billy Crystal and course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff	3144	A
so much of that was so true and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles it was so funny both of them were great	3144	A
oh they are are we just laughed so hard and like i said with City Slick i mean with Soapdish it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know just they just carried it off to the tee it was	3144	A
no	3144	A
how neat	3144	A
shoot yeah	3144	A
oh yeah	3144	A
yeah i think it is i think it is	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
oh gosh i never laughed and people were just screaming and applauding and you know it was just hysterical	3144	A
oh me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now i mean i'm getting around real good and i'm just still real sore and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after	3144	A
uh but see i don't have permanent work i right now i'm working with a temporary agency	3144	A
and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers because_1 you can learn all the software for free	3144	A
and so i went up to do WordPerfect because_1 that seems like that's what everybody wants	3144	A
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day and i said yeah and i went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that	3144	A
and uh i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week and	3144	A
so i went to my doctor's last Thursday and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh you're just healing really well i just can't get over this he says	3144	A
in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things if you want to play ball you can go play ball he says now i'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to and uh you know he was teasing me and	3144	A
he says yeah you'll be out there waterskiing i can just see it now	3144	A
and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks i said okay fine i i will i will whatever you call easy i'll do it you know	3144	A
but and i've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it	3144	A
and so i don't i'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when i was when i'm still sort of on the sore side	3144	A
but well what- what's your next have you seen Robin Hood yet	3144	A
uh	3144	A
oh yeah	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
oh really	3144	A
well i went course i am a Kevin Costner fan supreme	3144	A
uh-huh gosh was that wonderful	3144	A
oh yeah	3144	A
i do too i think he's really good	3144	A
i wouldn't think well my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night so i sort of think i may go do that	3144	A
good	3144	A
i have- my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age and we went to the	3144	A
does tend to get talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how they're collected	3177	A
is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does	3177	A
enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are	3177	A
uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and	3177	A
well i think	3177	A
i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right	3177	A
i	3177	A
no not uh not near to the extent that it was	3177	A
right	3177	A
right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good incentive- good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of	3177	A
uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way	3177	A
people	3177	A
well	3177	A
right but couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there	3177	A
and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make	3177	A
and then some	3177	A
so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing	3177	A
uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year you'd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing	3177	A
doing away with everything except for yeah all forms- all forms of it including	3177	A
well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent	3177	A
yeah so if you took the money out of one	3177	A
well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage	3177	A
if if	3177	A
well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money	3177	A
you know pays taxes or not but he's going to have to pay that percentage see what i'm saying	3177	A
well when a guy comes in to you know he's got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries	3177	A
he pays fifteen percent tax let's say	3177	A
and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax	3177	A
so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it	3177	A
and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased	3177	A
because_1 the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him	3177	A
whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong	3177	A
see so i'm saying there's	3177	A
right right	3177	A
so you you tax	3177	A
yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it	3177	A
yeah it it does seem	3177	A
it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they	3177	A
they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them_1 anymore	3177	A
so	3177	A
that's true that's true not being an economy major i guess they'd never ask me anyway	3177	A
oh	3177	A
right	3177	A
but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments	3177	B
but we don't have that anymore do we	3177	B
i didn't think so they've even cut you know who can have an IRA	3177	B
that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now they've cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair	3177	B
but they already tax us i mean where we live it's eight almost eight and a half percent tax	3177	B
oh and then some and then some	3177	B
are you talking about doing away with income tax	3177	B
i don't think	3177	B
well we're already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i don't think that would generate enough money	3177	B
oh i see what you're saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um	3177	B
off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period	3177	B
well if they're not reporting the income now they're still not paying it so what's the point	3177	B
no	3177	B
um-hum	3177	B
right	3177	B
right	3177	B
right	3177	B
oh i see what you're saying but if we had to have an income tax which they're never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay	3177	B
what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPA's and	3177	B
H&R Blocks would be out of of a job but uh	3177	B
yeah	3177	B
i never have understood why they don't do that	3177	B
no no	3177	B
i don't know i- i guess there's never a an answer nobody ever asks	3177	B
they don't ask me at all	3177	B
i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because_1 some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they don't pay anything	3177	B
and i question their i- i- i just think that they've made it almost a joke	3177	B
all the deductions in the the way you can send-	3177	B
okay um	3148	B
in Plano	3148	B
yes where do you live	3148	B
oh okay	3148	B
huh	3148	B
um i was trying to think uh something we were watching the other day and they were doing	3148	B
an overview of Los Angeles uh from an area that was up higher and you literally could see the band of smog that uh i've never been out there but	3148	B
it was it was quite evident that	3148	B
it was a real brown area and	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
yes well i know uh that's been the concern in Europe they hadn't uh we have friends in Germany and uh	3148	B
have family that live near the Black Forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we	3148	B
switched- uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars	3148	B
uh that's something that Europe didn't do right away and now they're doing that and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found	3148	B
that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there it's not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of	3148	B
um i guess from from something that the car was	3148	B
um	3148	B
was giving	3148	B
yes and	3148	B
yes yeah	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yeah i i get that sometimes um my line gets some static i don't know why	3148	B
well and i would think in our um we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and uh oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal	3148	B
oh i don't know what to usually it's the other phone i have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me	3148	B
okay	3148	B
i don't know what uh	3148	B
i i don't know what the problem is but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that uh	3148	B
there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days and and it yes it can be used and it can help but uh that was a problem that they were still	3148	B
working on but	3148	B
what-	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yes	3148	B
uh i hope so	3148	B
well i do think um i mean you've already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there's a problem and more people are interested in uh	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yes well and and for the future generations too uh	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
where do you live	3148	A
in Plano	3148	A
in Dallas	3148	A
uh the air pollution isn't too bad in our area so we're very fortunate but	3148	A
i know in some areas it's really it it really is bad	3148	A
i haven't either	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad particularly in the areas where there are industries uh	3148	A
where they are burning a lot of coal and oil up more up north i guess uh i think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution antipollution devices i think the	3148	A
air isn't as bad as it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area	3148	A
from acid rain	3148	A
i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid	3148	A
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time i think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots	3148	A
as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad	3148	A
what's interesting several years ago i took a course	3148	A
uh on uh well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and	3148	A
how much pollution there was and there wasn't from various kinds of of energy and uh	3148	A
at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh-poohed you know oh you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing	3148	A
and it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage	3148	A
so it's kind of interesting the change in	3148	A
perspective	3148	A
from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear uh i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use	3148	A
is not bomb quality and we're so strict with all our controls in the United States the chances of of an accident are slight and it doesn't pollute the air at all it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant	3148	A
many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants it's kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear	3148	A
so i don't know in Europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become uh bomb quality	3148	A
but that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there's some problem uh pollute the groundwater	3148	A
so i don't know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or uh fusion or something clean well we've got a problem on the line don't we	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
but uh	3148	A
solar of course would be the clean cleanest	3148	A
i can't hear you at all for all this static	3148	A
now i can again	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
oh yeah it it's still got a long way to go	3148	A
it's just you know a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways it may not in all ways maybe they'll come up with fusion	3148	A
you know control- be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but	3148	A
one of these days because that's perfectly clean	3148	A
it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isn't not at all and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so that's not going to work	3148	A
at least not now but uh	3148	A
who knows what the future will hold	3148	A
uh as far as energy goes i i think	3148	A
with solving some of the energy future energy problems we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well	3148	A
i do to	3148	A
i like to be optimistic i don't like to be pessimistic about these things	3148	A
we have one earth to live on and we got to take care of it	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth	3148	A
and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems	3148	A
i'm afraid	3148	A
i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't so many of them didn't people didn't care you know it's whatever	3148	A
you know recycle well if it's a problem forget that uh not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away	3148	A
how horrible you know now i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes uh and create-	3148	A
um my name's yeah i'm from uh New York where you from	3165	A
uh Brad LeMeaux	3165	A
Nola in Texas i i talked to someone from Texas yesterday where in Texas you say	3165	A
okay you have pets	3165	A
do you have pets	3165	A
yeah that's what the topic's supposed to be	3165	A
i got my New York accent	3165	A
yes	3165	A
that's pretty easy	3165	A
what the	3165	A
what type were they like sicklets and stuff like that	3165	A
i don't know if the	3165	A
i i had fish that were like they were called sicklets a type of family this is when i was a kid they they had um	3165	A
what are they called like oscars and uh i forgot the different names that they had but they would eat eat they would actually- they ate when they got big enough they would eat goldfish we would buy goldfish and feed them to them_1	3165	A
yeah i i agree with that i- i- i um	3165	A
and what did they do they they just took them_1 back	3165	A
yeah	3165	A
really yeah that's	3165	A
yeah that's what my friend used to do with his other fish he used to sell them_1 back to the store they'd buy them but uh that's cool that's	3165	A
that's easier	3165	A
do you do you still you still have guppies	3165	A
so you you stayed with the guppies	3165	A
great great yeah the- fish are fun	3165	A
no i- i used to have fish when i was a kid	3165	A
but i don't have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my parent's house i uh gave my fish to my friends and fish tank i think i gave to someone else	3165	A
um but i thought a few years ago- go and get one but i've moved around so much recently	3165	A
yeah they're not that easy but although it like living in New York City there's definitely no other pet that you would want i mean people- some people a lot of people have cats some people have dogs i mean i've i've even seen big big dogs in small apartments and i don't really see that	3165	A
yeah someday if i move out into the country i like it like a you know like a Labrador or something like that some you know bigger dog that could kind of run around outside and stuff	3165	A
but yeah you see these big dog- i mean i see this guy in my building with some i think it's like a golden retriever or something like that and he he's good though he takes him out all the time or her out all the time	3165	A
yeah this guy he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog so he probably gets in enough exercise	3165	A
but you know lot	3165	A
i'm doing fine	3165	B
what's what was your name	3165	B
oh i'm Nola and i'm in Plano Texas	3165	B
it's Plano it's just north of Dallas	3165	B
uh oh pets yes	3165	B
yeah i didn't quite understand what you said i'm sorry	3165	B
we don't have uh i grew up in New Jersey but it's been a long time since i lived there	3165	B
did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish that's it	3165	B
yeah it's uh	3165	B
uh uh neither my husband or i really wanted to take care of cats or dogs or anything like that so	3165	B
and the girls kind of wanted something we have four- uh well now we have four girls when we got the fish to start with we had two or three but um	3165	B
for some reason i just decided to start a fish tank and set up a ten gallon fish tank and	3165	B
it started with the some uh we had a real hard time getting it established tried the goldfish and they were just filthy could not keep the tank clean um	3165	B
eventually i took them back to the store and started- started all over again and	3165	B
i had another couple of kinds that ate each other so that bunch didn't work either	3165	B
um there were some neons and a couple of other kind i can't remember what they were	3165	B
but but they didn't get along very well whatever they were	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
huh	3165	B
well these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that but they were	3165	B
and uh they- i could see them_1 picking on each other	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
yeah anyway i finally got rid of those- those all killed each other off and i cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again and so- established and i got about half a dozen guppies from a friend	3165	B
and they just bred and bred and bred and they're uh there must've been a hundred guppies in that tank and i had- i took- i must've taken thirty or forty of them at a time back to the store two or three different times	3165	B
they took them_1 back and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time	3165	B
so yeah helped to buy fish food and filters	3165	B
uh-huh	3165	B
but- but- but uh then i i- i- i went for a while where um while i was pregnant with our new little baby we uh i- i just	3165	B
kept forgetting to clean the fish- tank and it was really dirty for a long time but those fish still lived in there and um	3165	B
finally i cleaned the tank out and most of them had disappeared um and i don't think i've got any males in there anymore so they're not multiplying anymore	3165	B
yeah yeah i need to get a new um	3165	B
algae eater though	3165	B
yep there's still there's about a dozen guppies in there right now	3165	B
so but that's the only thing we've got <b_aside> yes you may i know <e_aside> sorry and and so you have fish or do you have	3165	B
but you don't have anything right now	3165	B
yeah it's kind of a problem moving them	3165	B
you feel sorry for them	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
uh-huh	3165	B
you'd have to do it an awful lot though	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
um-hum	3116	A
yeah i- i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work	3116	A
so it's something that i end up kind of experimenting with with my girlfriends or maybe taking my girls out when he's gone and	3116	A
and so we end up usually finding something that's uh quick service and uh that's hopefully economical and uh	3116	A
certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre	3116	A
um as far as to really go out for an evening though i do like to have a place that's	3116	A
not real real formal but kind of on a formal side just because usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and it's real relaxing and then	3116	A
uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so	3116	A
um i guess my favorite kind of foods- foods would be uh the ones that	3116	A
well i don't know favorite is just going out for a good good hearty steak but	3116	A
i- i- i find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak houses it doesn't seem and i- i find that amazing being in Texas i'm from another state originally and	3116	A
i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state	3116	A
and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so	3116	A
oh really	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
huh	3116	A
huh	3116	A
yeah it's kind of an interesting approach	3116	A
so	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
yeah yeah	3116	A
um-hum um-hum	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah that's what we have too yeah and yeah you do have to kind of decide well are we there to get a good meal and and just	3116	A
be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesn't work with kids	3116	A
so what would make you go back to a good restaurant	3116	A
um-hum	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
and do you find that when you have children that it's it really makes uh you can really tell the difference between a good and a mediocre restaurant by the way they treat you with kids	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
um-hum	3116	A
oh yeah	3116	A
yeah we have a restaurant over here called Gershwin's that has a piano player always during your mealtime and it	3116	A
it just makes for a real classy feel and uh it kind of carries over the conversations next to you so you're not concentrating what someone else is saying next to you but i mean but you know at the next table but	3116	A
just within your own little group so it makes for a nice nice place to go	3116	A
oh yeah	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
well sounds good	3116	A
no i think we covered everything	3116	A
well thank you for being home okay bye-bye	3116	A
okay talk about uh what kind of restaurants we we like to go to and what uh makes us go back and i'll start talking about it so	3116	B
usually i just kind of like uh places that are family style kind of things because_1 it's a a casual atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff and and uh	3116	B
but we were in California recently and i went we went to a couple of very uh i guess expensive extravagant restaurants because_1 it was kind of the thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like	3116	B
and we got to get some real good food more exotic and uh we thought that the service was very good	3116	B
and uh that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even though it is expensive you know like maybe once a year or once every six months go to it or something like that	3116	B
but how about you	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
um-hum	3116	B
um-hum	3116	B
um-hum you know what we have around here too is uh a place where you uh you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself	3116	B
yeah and they they have everything else cooked you know but baked potatoes and all that but you you pick your meat and you know whether it's marinated or or just regular	3116	B
and uh then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself you know and then have all the stuff to put on it you know like if you want to	3116	B
i don't know butter on it or whatever or garlic and stuff like that	3116	B
you can you can do it that's kind of interesting it was really good	3116	B
yeah we we thought that was that wasn't too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these	3116	B
fancier restaurants and and i thought uh i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because_1 you know you see all these things like you see all these chef's chef's shows and stuff like that	3116	B
and uh and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if that's any good you know it looks kind of small but actually it wasn't bad at all	3116	B
you know when they have like seafood dishes uh but it's just kind of kind of sparse with different things put in it that that really uh	3116	B
that really taste pretty good you didn't you wouldn't think it goes together you know	3116	B
but uh but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family family type of things you know	3116	B
because_1 it's uh it's easier to go with two kids two young kids now	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
right right	3116	B
yeah that's true	3116	B
well i think uh some of the things that i liked were uh	3116	B
uh well i would see the food and whether or not it tastes good uh the service if they're you know courteous or if they just kind of are hasty you know if they just get your order and go and you never see them_1 again or they coming talk- you know talk with you a little bit or something	3116	B
yes i have we have we have noticed that	3116	B
yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when they're oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know	3116	B
to occupy them_1 you can really tell	3116	B
the other thing i've liked too is uh now this isn't you don't have this at at family restaurants but uh is some type of a like a a pianist or something	3116	B
that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
there was two places that we went to one in San Francisco and one in uh in Monterey California	3116	B
and uh the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you could- had a great view you know of San Francisco and everything	3116	B
and uh and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because_1 it was overlooking the water too	3116	B
so that was that was a couple things that we liked	3116	B
but	3116	B
okay you have anything else to say	3116	B
okay well thanks a lot	3116	B
okay	3116	B
bye-bye	3116	B
so it	3187	B
well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we	3187	B
sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore he actually died a few months after that and so	3187	B
as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he	3187	B
it was either you- know a nursing	3187	B
home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days	3187	B
um well the	3187	B
see uh well we	3187	B
he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list	3187	B
right we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into	3187	B
or we no actually no it was even Mennonite related i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly	3187	B
the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in	3187	B
uh what do you think	3187	B
um-hum	3187	B
yeah	3187	B
yeah yeah that's important i'd say	3187	B
okay	3187	B
yeah	3187	B
right so that	3187	B
right and that becomes difficult then	3187	B
um-hum yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life	3187	B
but he was essentially too proud and too	3187	B
independent so that even though his heart was	3187	B
getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he	3187	B
lived in	3187	B
his own house as long as he could though he was living alone	3187	B
had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the uh top without a great deal of pain	3187	B
and this eventually	3187	B
things just went too far and he	3187	B
he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home	3187	B
right well that's	3187	B
yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to	3187	B
help decide what's the right thing	3187	B
and	3187	B
um-hum	3187	B
yep	3187	B
how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home	3187	A
uh-huh	3187	A
right	3187	A
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him	3187	A
oh my	3187	A
yeah so the convenience	3187	A
right	3187	A
my grandmother lived with us um until August um and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia	3187	A
and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away	3187	A
so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one	3187	A
that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so	3187	A
yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room	3187	A
so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but	3187	A
when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and i've got little children here who needed me here	3187	A
um she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day	3187	A
so	3187	A
she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
uh-huh	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
oh	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
yes	3187	A
well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them_1 make decisions it sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now	3187	A
so	3187	A
well we enjoyed having her here but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her	3187	A
and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so	3187	A
it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because_1 she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair	3187	A
so i think she'll adjust	3187	A
i'll let you go ahead and start yeah	3198	B
you know i think that's changed just in the last generation just in the last little while because i know my father-in-law doesn't do that much of that	3198	B
kind of stuff but my husband is wonderful	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah yeah there still some that aren't cooperating but	3198	B
they're not accepting that anymore yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah well i feel like um	3198	B
to an extent that is really important you know that that um it is important for women who need to work uh or are in a position that they want to	3198	B
that they can do that um but i also think it is important for them to be with the children	3198	B
i- i think there there are some things that women just	3198	B
are designed to do better than men and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women i don't think it should ever be totally equal	3198	B
you know that's not uh we're not made like that that's right	3198	B
hm	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that	3198	B
and for some it's not a problem but there's more and more it's difficult for a family to make a living on one	3198	B
income it can be done but you make sacrifices you know and and it's um	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
-okay	3198	A
did you want me to go ahead	3198	A
okay well one thing i- i- i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality	3198	A
uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did um	3198	A
it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids versus um the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which uh they did everything they went to work and they took care of the family so	3198	A
exactly	3198	A
exactly yeah	3198	A
yeah that's the way my husband is too i mean it it doesn't uh doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes it doesn't bother him- him at all to do the laundry versus uh men from	3198	A
way back there is that well if you did that you were henpecked or whatever but	3198	A
men are starting	3198	A
yeah those are very few i think those men don't last very long in relationships because they think women know what they want	3198	A
right exactly and it's it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then	3198	A
kind of realize hey there's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all so it's it's kind of a	3198	A
a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households and i think that's even gonna get better	3198	A
even you know even more so i think it's just gonna be where men will do as much cleaning as women do	3198	A
and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this it will be	3198	A
uh hopefully for my daughter who i instill into it doesn't matter if you wanna drive a truck honey or if it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse it doesn't matter if you want to be	3198	A
uh the President or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor it doesn't matter it's what you want to be so i have always instilled into her and i think	3198	A
mothers um are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey	3198	A
you don't have to stay with nursing you don't have to be a secretary you don't have to be you can be whatever you want to be and whether it be a welder a trucker or whatever	3198	A
as long as you uh go to school for it and get the education so	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
if they want to right	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
i do too you know there's a certain part of me	3198	A
uh-huh	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
well emotionally i think uh women do a little bit uh i- i think that's the gap is coming closer as um	3198	A
what i've learned in uh just just	3198	A
being out there it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings and they get together and they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didn't have with their fathers	3198	A
are expressing more emotions learning what emotions are it may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves um	3198	A
i- i know of some mothers that uh i guess i'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more um	3198	A
low keyed more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised you know to develop whatever skills that they have and some of the men are developing uh	3198	A
very good too so it may come down to where it's	3198	A
it's individual basis where everybody's treated as an individual and not by	3198	A
sex if you wanna stay home and take care of the kids honey that's fine i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
on one income um-hum	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
yeah that	3198	A
kind of like what uh my husband and myself are doing right now my daughter's three even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with she's an only child i don't know if you've only got one	3198	A
hi Nancy well do you do a lot of dining out	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
well we do some- some dining out um i i do a lot of cooking so um	3146	A
mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and i i we don't go out too often as a family um unless it's like a fast food kind of thing	3146	A
but um but we do enjoy dining out one of our favorite places here in in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe i don't know if you have you ever been there	3146	A
um well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and uh	3146	A
have you the- now that's down in uh Highland Park it's Highland Park Village did you like it	3146	A
oh i love it	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
oh it is it's fabulous it really is good	3146	A
Atlantic Cafe is down on i believe it's on McKinney	3146	A
um and originally- originally the two the the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the- the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe and then they they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific	3146	A
and i loved them both i really do i think they're wonderful	3146	A
that's our favorite you know what we'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is Houston's have you been there	3146	A
it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in and	3146	A
as long as you know that it's okay but they have i think one just about the best prime rib	3146	A
um anywhere in the area i love it	3146	A
and my husband really likes their ribs so it's hysterical we go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't even look at the menu i know right away what we what we want yeah yeah	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
was it	3146	A
really i've never- i've i've been there for like you know lunch but i've never been there for dinner and it was good yeah	3146	A
oh that's great that's great another nice place for for prime rib is Baby Doe's	3146	A
Maxwell's nice have you been there	3146	A
oh and i didn't think we ate out very often Baby Doe's is nice and one place i'd never been that i would really like to go to	3146	A
uh is Lawry's i've heard that's real good Lawry's Prime Ribs	3146	A
i've i've never been there but i've heard it's real good	3146	A
yes yes actually they have one in Richardson that i've been to uh they have real nice lunches have you have you been there for lunch or yeah	3146	A
really	3146	A
really	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
the specials	3146	A
have you ever- been to Biffin's	3146	A
i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place	3146	A
over near Plano Super Bowl and uh i've i've not been there	3146	A
i've been there	3146	A
that was nice	3146	A
oh i've heard of it where where it's made it's like it's like a it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag and it's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something	3146	A
yeah	3146	A
oh	3146	A
oh	3146	A
oh	3146	A
oh i bet it was i bet it was	3146	A
the last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day and we took another friend with us and	3146	A
uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves and so we had they had uh like a	3146	A
berry assortment it was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom	3146	A
and you know they they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the	3146	A
plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it was really really relatively simple but oh it was good it was really good	3146	A
you can't find them yeah yeah yeah yeah you know i- i'm originally from Connecticut and uh	3146	A
i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and i was really amazed you know the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real	3146	A
real pretty	3146	A
but they lacked the service and they lacked the atmosphere- the just the i don't know the restaurants down here seem like they have uh	3146	A
i guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good	3146	A
and i thought i would really miss that	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it	3146	A
ooh really	3146	A
okay	3146	B
no um we don't although we enjoy it um we do it more when we have company come um what about you	3146	B
i've heard of that but i haven't been there um where about is that	3146	B
oh okay i i've been to Cafe Pacific	3146	B
right	3146	B
yes um	3146	B
before- before we moved to the area my brother uh lived in Dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and we all ate there and oh their seafood was wonderful	3146	B
now where is the Atlantic Cafe	3146	B
oh okay	3146	B
no um but i've heard that's really good too and	3146	B
oh	3146	B
oh	3146	B
oh okay but-	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
you know right away what you want	3146	B
well we really enjoy prime rib too and uh actually the the Steak And Ale out here um	3146	B
we've gone to uh	3146	B
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night and uh the time we went the prime rib was really good	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
yeah yeah	3146	B
oh i've heard about that too but no we've uh i guess we eat out even less than i realize	3146	B
oh	3146	B
yeah	3146	B
yes i'd i had heard that too um	3146	B
have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway	3146	B
oh okay	3146	B
yes uh primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes but uh	3146	B
during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup and- or salad	3146	B
entrees and accompaniments and dessert and uh the my husband and i like veal uh a lot and their veal dishes have been good we've tried	3146	B
different ones when they've had them	3146	B
as one of the	3146	B
um-hum	3146	B
i yes no	3146	B
right and	3146	B
i haven't either uh one place and i've only been there for lunch but um i went with a friend and we met her husband um down on Greenville down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's	3146	B
oh i we just we- it was and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but um	3146	B
and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert uh which was a chocolate sack i don't know if you tried but or something-	3146	B
yes	3146	B
it yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry	3146	B
uh puree and we shared one the three of us and it was plenty because it was very rich but uh i wished i'd had a camera it was beautiful	3146	B
uh	3146	B
oh	3146	B
oh	3146	B
yes yeah	3146	B
oh	3146	B
it sounds wonderful	3146	B
well that's uh one of the things the- that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant uh i love fresh berries and their	3146	B
uh their fruits are always exceptional i don't i'm know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market uh you can't find them like that and	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
i would too because well i guess because we don't go out very often when we do go out um	3146	B
in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess and uh it is it's a whole experience of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too	3146	B
yeah	3146	B
um that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful it's called Cafe Max and it's at Plano Road and Campbell	3146	B
they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three	3146	B
boy i- i i don't know that's a that's a a tough one uh uh and it's uh i suppose it's it's	3107	B
changes as uh as perception- my perception changes of of what uh i'm getting gypped on this week or this month uh uh	3107	B
uh we're just uh going through uh uh well there's a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh	3107	B
if i step back i'm not sure i'd i'd uh say that what what about you	3107	B
oh okay	3107	B
yes	3107	B
okay but but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
right okay	3107	B
and and yeah and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
uh yeah i it uh	3107	B
the that- that is- that's a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there it's uh if i remember right you well if they	3107	B
they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh	3107	B
two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i i'm coming up on i've been at TI now uh uh	3107	B
coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah that's a that that is a a a negative but uh	3107	B
but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
well that that yeah that's uh that- that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh	3107	B
that's the the the uh yeah that- that's uh why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour	3107	B
and uh and but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing	3107	B
uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh	3107	B
the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different but uh	3107	B
but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh the they've uh uh	3107	B
gone through a couple years ago here where they	3107	B
uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now they're in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that	3107	B
just routine visits uh ah they will	3107	B
compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah	3107	B
well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh	3107	B
to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to uh uh give you	3107	B
you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're you're not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh i'm not i'm not sure it my uh	3107	B
one of the phrases i use is that that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of	3107	B
always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides here it's it's uh	3107	B
yeah uh and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh	3107	B
idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i	3107	B
i don't know in in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh	3107	B
although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
yeah and	3107	B
there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary	3107	A
that week right	3107	A
um	3107	A
well um i uh right now i'm into a weird situation i'm a graduate student and uh	3107	A
uh i don't have that many benefits per se	3107	A
um	3107	A
sort of get	3107	A
yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um	3107	A
uh i think health insurance is real real important	3107	A
uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um	3107	A
a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance	3107	A
they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical they they force you to buy here now i'm covered by my wife's anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester	3107	A
for uh mandatory so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case i'd rather that that went to something else	3107	A
right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars	3107	A
sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're very- they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians	3107	A
so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um	3107	A
but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job i don't you know	3107	A
oh wow so that's the real	3107	A
yeah i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off they you know usually let her	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
oh really	3107	A
no	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
that's oh that's a	3107	A
that's reasonable i think	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
weigh are see such of things	3107	A
yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance	3107	A
and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so	3107	A
um-hum	3107	A
right	3107	A
at least us who decides	3107	A
right	3107	A
right you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that that's the	3107	A
well hi Nola this is Vic uh do you have any hobbies that uh that you really participate in	3132	A
oh	3132	A
is that right	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
oh	3132	A
do you have uh as part of your home schooling do you have any like uh handicraft type things that you've done with with your children	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
do you actually sew some clothes for them and that sort of stuff or have you before	3132	A
oh that's good	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
right	3132	A
um	3132	A
well that's nice	3132	A
something they can keep for a long time and enjoy later on	3132	A
keep them warm that's always beneficial too	3132	A
yeah	3132	A
well i think most of my hobbies are i don't really have any handicrafts that i can speak of i've done some woodworking type things but uh uh	3132	A
i don't really consider yard work a hobby either i guess it's uh	3132	A
yeah i do some of that and i i must admit that i do enjoy a certain amount of it i guess it's when it's a requirement such as mowing a lawn that it becomes somewhat less of a hobby	3132	A
yeah but um	3132	A
i'm interested in music so i do a few things in that regard	3132	A
well i uh uh my children are uh learning to play the piano	3132	A
and it's been ages ago since i played but i still like to sit down and and play around with the piano myself some	3132	A
and i have twelve year old daughter that's	3132	A
far surpassed any ability that i ever have had	3132	A
um	3132	A
yeah and uh also there's an instrument of all things called a recorder	3132	A
uh and i- i play that some just by ear i don't and music on that	3132	A
i used to play the clarinet and i still have one or actually recently just got another one and uh i play it from time to time as well	3132	A
well i am in a a church choir in fact it's that organization that uh it is doing this fund raising using uh	3132	A
uh the T I thing for that- for that- for that as a matter of fact and that's that's why i'm enrolled in this is our choir is doing it so that that i can pass a good bit of time and i do enjoy that a great deal	3132	A
um and i bike i bike ride i guess that's really the closest thing to a bonafide hobby that i have	3132	A
just a sort of combination between bicycling and exercise or hobby and an exercise so that's probably the extent of my hobbies	3132	A
um	3132	A
did you really well that's different	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
oh you had to play the	3132	A
yeah	3132	A
i bet that was	3132	A
that's very different	3132	A
uh	3132	A
well i'm not sure that it really matters a whole lot at all	3132	A
that's sort of been my interpretation of of these conversations um	3132	A
in fact i think we probably uh	3132	A
have talked long enough	3132	A
would be my guess so	3132	A
yeah oh i'm sure it's been adequate	3132	A
so i enjoyed talking with you	3132	A
and and good luck with your children	3132	A
all right bye-bye	3132	A
um most of my hobbies include three- three little girls	3132	B
they keep me pretty busy	3132	B
i uh we're home schooling	3132	B
so i um am real involved in learning how to teach and teaching and that kind of thing	3132	B
um i'm also we're expecting a baby in August so i've been trying to get some things in the house organized for that	3132	B
and have repainted a couple of chairs and repainted a dresser and some of that kind of thing um	3132	B
um yeah we do different things uh i sew so uh i haven't had a lot of time for it for a little while but um	3132	B
that's one thing that we do do some of um i	3132	B
oh yeah yeah um i	3132	B
have i can do lots of things and i enjoy lots of different things i don't have a lot time for most of them but when i do i like uh i like art i like uh	3132	B
the sewing um	3132	B
let's see what else	3132	B
i can do you know lots of different things like cross-stitch and different things but i just don't spend that much time on it uh quilting	3132	B
i've made quilts for the girls' beds and things like that um	3132	B
yeah something to cover them and keep them warm	3132	B
that's right	3132	B
um	3132	B
i think it could be i do a little bit of gardening	3132	B
yeah	3132	B
it's more tedious	3132	B
oh what do you do	3132	B
oh wonderful	3132	B
huh	3132	B
i would love for my girls to take piano lessons but we've been unemployed for a while so i haven't had a chance to do that so	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
oh	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
you're more interested- interested in the instruments then in voice	3132	B
the T I thing oh that's neat	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
uh-huh	3132	B
uh-huh i've enjoyed music too um i was in choirs from fifth grade on i think and	3132	B
and uh had just a little piano a little violin	3132	B
i even had a little bagpipe at one time	3132	B
yeah in in ninth grade our high school is Northern Highlands in New Jersey	3132	B
and they uh they- they just that year they began teaching bagpipe for the to put together group for	3132	B
it was fun it was interesting	3132	B
yeah	3132	B
but uh	3132	B
we all enjoy music too um i don't know if they want us to specifically to do more on the craft side or	3132	B
probably not	3132	B
yeah cause-	3132	B
i don't i don't know how long we've gone but	3132	B
okay nice to talk to you too	3132	B
okay thank you bye-bye	3132	B

i was gonna ask you could you go to you know nice places and	3186	B
so where are your places- what- what are places you- you know memorable places you've eaten	3186	B
oh Houston's uh-huh	3186	B
it's a great place	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
oh okay because_1 i was thinking well i- i grew up in Panama City i get it	3186	B
right	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
do you like Mexican do you like Mexican food oh	3186	B
well i mean there's so many places here you know they're just it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here	3186	B
but in the Addison well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area anyway	3186	B
i mean now there's a new Italian place called Sfuzzi	3186	B
that has a great i've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas and now there's one in Addison	3186	B
it's F S it's S F U Z I	3186	B
and it's on it's in Addison and it's a great place also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copeland's	3186	B
oh i really like Copeland's	3186	B
oh the yeah the i know no i don't like that place	3186	B
see uh uh yeah actually- actually when i went i thought the food was not good	3186	B
Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of	3186	B
see i when i went i thought the people drove me crazy first of all but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
do you like like Southwestern	3186	B
well now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill	3186	B
that's on Beltline that's close to Houston's a matter of fact and um	3186	B
it's great i mean they're they have i think sometimes i've been when i thought well it wasn't as good but i went there recently and i thought well this really is good	3186	B
so that's that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill	3186	B
and um	3186	B
a whole new dining experience	3186	B
well they haven't beeped us have they	3186	B
oh i thought sometimes they say you know this is three minutes or whatever	3186	B
okay	3186	B
okay well thanks for calling for helping us out bye-bye	3186	B
all right this is easy for me since i	3186	A
yeah well i travel i do about forty percent of my time is on the road	3186	A
i eat a lot of meals out um well i'm also married my wife is A1 cook but she enjoys eating out so i have to	3186	A
share it with her and uh actually it's very easy for me because i- i have a practice- make it a practice when i am out i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here	3186	A
so- so i look for just about anything and it's it's uh	3186	A
it's a lot of fun i don't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because_1 i you know	3186	A
oh sure yeah and it's it's really great i- i	3186	A
i like different types of food	3186	A
uh oh you name- okay you name it let's see you've got one down in uh	3186	A
down near uh Addison	3186	A
um there's two restaurants that i particularly like that i eat every time i get into Texas or i get into Atlanta Georgia i make sure i go and that's Houston's	3186	A
yep okay	3186	A
it's it's great there's a a restaurant in um	3186	A
right outside of Reading Pennsylvania it's called Alfredo's	3186	A
that does not look like	3186	A
a restaurant that you would really wanna recommend to a lot of people but it is fabulous- fantastic	3186	A
uh there's a restaurant and i don't recall the name of it uh in uh Panama City of course not too people wanna rush back to Panama City uh	3186	A
Panama	3186	A
the country Panama	3186	A
okay-	3186	A
no this is the country this is the country Panama all right	3186	A
and uh	3186	A
but i have gotten to quite a few and i go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there i	3186	A
you know and i know the locations and i know the places but i lot of times i don't remember the names i'd have to go back through some expense reports	3186	A
but particularly in down in your area i'm looking for some some more restaurants	3186	A
so i you know i don't know what's what's down there other the ones in Addison	3186	A
not particularly that's one of the few why which one were you gonna recommend	3186	A
uh-huh	3186	A
uh-huh	3186	A
right	3186	A
okay i have a	3186	A
okay let i'm i'm writing it down	3186	A
okay	3186	A
i've been there	3186	A
okay i've been there um one down there is the uh i think it's an old schoolhouse uh	3186	A
well i like the food but i don't care for the clowning around	3186	A
oh really	3186	A
oh i've had i	3186	A
that's it that's it i've had excellent food there	3186	A
true true	3186	A
uh-huh	3186	A
yeah all right well that's great uh no Italian that's fine i'm i	3186	A
make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's	3186	A
which is right down there in Addison-	3186	A
oh yeah	3186	A
all right	3186	A
really	3186	A
um-hum	3186	A
good	3186	A
well this is great this is gonna give me a	3186	A
some more places to go okay fine	3186	A
i guess our time's about up so	3186	A
uh well they don't always	3186	A
yeah i	3186	A
they've been doing that when uh the circuits are busy	3186	A
and uh other than that they you know leave you go about five minutes and then that that's about it i guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat so	3186	A
it was a pleasure talking you okay	3186	A
you bet	3186	A
bye-bye	3186	A
okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and and um trying to do go to school back to college again so it's	3193	A
it's uh exercise is kind of forget it	3193	A
they sure do yeah my daughter	3193	A
yeah yeah uh she's three so three with a i think it's almost like she's got this endless	3193	A
energy i mean it's no longer nap time that kind of thing so	3193	A
yes yeah so	3193	A
yeah	3193	A
exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of uh she's an only child too so it's it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's	3193	A
um-hum sure sure	3193	A
yeah uh-huh	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
um-hum sure	3193	A
um-hum -sure	3193	A
sure	3193	A
sure	3193	A
yeah yeah that's about what uh basically if we can get out and take a walk it's	3193	A
it's great but uh most of the time we can't so it's uh we're too busy doing other things but that also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah	3193	A
oh sure	3193	A
sure	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
sure	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
to loosen it up yeah yeah that's true	3193	A
so yeah-	3193	A
oh yes	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
so oh boy	3193	A
sure trying to keep up with the nineteen months uh sure they're into everything	3193	A
the baby hm	3193	A
oh he was cranky	3193	A
sure once you lose that sure that's very true	3193	A
it wasn't too long ago where i was doing the same thing and that uh totally gets your mental capabilities uh thrown off totally when they're	3193	A
uh tired and uh you wake up in the middle of the night and it's my daughter used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that so	3193	A
daddy just came home so the house is starting to liven up here now but uh that's about it that's kind of how my exercise is right now is just basically running after a three year old	3193	A
so	3193	A
um-hum	3193	A
um-hum	3193	A
it sure does yeah	3193	A
sure sure well it was really nice talking to you then	3193	A
okay um-hum thank you um-hum bye now	3193	A
okay-	3193	B
well it	3193	B
but if it well- if i remember back to when i had a child they give you a lot of exercise just what age is your child	3193	B
uh-huh	3193	B
oh she's given up the naps	3193	B
oh right and so many people work nowadays there you know there's not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either	3193	B
but well my main uh exercise the only one i've ever stuck to at all is walking	3193	B
and i try to get out and walk two miles	3193	B
most everyday but but it you know it fluctuates i'll do real good for a while and then i'll be off of it for a while just depending on what's happened but the last uh	3193	B
couple of uh years uh my husband is an accountant and he moved his office to the house and i work for him	3193	B
so that helps because we're at home and i can get out and walk a lot better than when i was working in an office	3193	B
so that has helped	3193	B
but anything else uh	3193	B
well we have a lake house and down there when we go down there some on weekends we get a different type of exercise you know just doing a lot of work and things down there	3193	B
but that and uh and walking is about it	3193	B
um-hum i will admit though when i	3193	B
do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and	3193	B
uh i really do uh and and i smoke and i can tell that it just immediately if i've been coughing or something you know it just immediately seems to clear my lungs up	3193	B
but um	3193	B
well i got a lot of exercise though the last four or five days i have two grandchildren	3193	B
three months and nineteen months and my daughter and son-in-law went on a	3193	B
well and the baby was sick so he wasn't good you know so it took- was one on one i mean i had to take one and he had to take the other one and it was busy	3193	B
and they woke up all during the night and i'm not uh used to that	3193	B
uh-huh	3193	B
um-hum	3193	B
um um-hum	3193	B
right uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep it also made me think of one other thing walking	3193	B
does for me when i do it it does help me mentally you know if i'm worried about something or whatever and i get out and do that	3193	B
walk it just i don't know it just sort of helps your mental attitude too	3193	B
so i miss that when i don't do it	3193	B
but	3193	B
well nice to talk to you	3193	B
bye bye	3193	B
we do actually we have a a Golden Retriever a dog and we have a cat and we have we just got two um	3137	B
Russian Dwarf hamsters which dwarf hamsters lucky us huh	3137	B
real small they're maybe about oh two inches long they're real small they're real tiny they're cute they really are cute	3137	B
uh my son's baseball coach uh had two and then had multiple hamsters that he was trying to get rid of	3137	B
and so that's that's where we got them from now we've been assured they're both males and they're in two separate cages so we don't want any	3137	B
we don't want to go into the dwarf hamster business	3137	B
how about you	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
uh-huh is- uh is- are they very small uh-huh	3137	B
oh uh-huh	3137	B
oh really yeah	3137	B
oh no kidding uh-huh	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
oh	3137	B
um-hum	3137	B
are you yeah	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
really boy that's real unusual for cats usually you just put down a litter box and that's the end of that yeah	3137	B
um-hum	3137	B
um-hum um-hum	3137	B
really really huh huh	3137	B
oh	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
really really hum	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
really yeah yeah oh that's too bad	3137	B
sure sure sure	3137	B
yeah yeah well we were real fortunate with our pets um when my husband and i were getting married we we had both been married before and so we were blending families and we had taken this blended families course through uh	3137	B
P I S T you know they how they have the effective- parent parent training effectiveness- -effectiveness training	3137	B
and uh so we took a blended families course and Linda Hitt the person who was teaching the course said sometimes when you have children on this side and children on this side	3137	B
and uh so we- i had always wanted a Golden Retriever i just think they're real neat dogs that that's a nice breed you know they're real calm and gentle and	3137	B
and whatnot so my husband thought well for Christmas he was going to surprise me with a puppy and he was looking around for a puppy and	3137	B
then um he saw he decided just on a whim i think i'll call the SPCA	3137	B
and he called the Dallas SPCA and he said you wouldn't happen to have a Golden Retriever would you and they said you won't believe it but we had one dropped off last night	3137	B
and he'd they said he's AKC registered he's two years old and he's going to go fast	3137	B
so we thought okay what's wrong with this dog who would give up a two year old Golden Retriever you know that's a nice dog something's got to be wrong with this dog	3137	B
nothing is wrong with it we have had him now for three years and just love him to death he is wonderful yeah he is he's a great dog he's he's	3137	B
he's he's great he's great we just- we think he's wonderful	3137	B
and our cat just kind of you know pays us the time of day when he's in the mood and otherwise	3137	B
we don't see him	3137	B
yeah he is he comes in and he goes out he's he kind of	3137	B
you know is just around we we don't really don't see him except for feeding time you know or when he wants when he's in the mood for a little affection	3137	B
he'll show up yeah yeah	3137	B
but so that's our family and we just you know uh everybody seems to get along real well the kids the dog and the cat so we're okay	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
the hamsters actually it's the dog that is enthralled with the hamsters because the hamsters are recent you know they were just last week	3137	B
and	3137	B
the first night we had them	3137	B
somebody knocked over the cage and we thought it was the cat we really did we blamed the cat and we thought the hamster had disappeared and had been eaten but we found him he he just he narrowly escaped with his life but he was found	3137	B
but since then we have discovered the dog sits and watches them for hours on end	3137	B
you know they'll get going in the little wheel and he'll sit there and just stare at them so i'm wondering now if it really was the cat who knocked them off the shelf it might have been it might have been the dog	3137	B
but the cat doesn't seem to be too bothered with them it's it's the dog that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters it's it's funny	3137	B
yeah yeah	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
really	3137	B
out really	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3137	B
but he doesn't seem to be bothered with them you know he's real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he's he's not too bad	3137	B
but so are you going to try again with another cat sometime	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
well uh Cathy do you have any pets in your home	3137	A
how nice um-hum	3137	A
dwarf hamsters	3137	A
how big is a dwarf hamster	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
my goodness where did you get those	3137	A
uh-huh	3137	A
well	3137	A
okay	3137	A
i was going to say that	3137	A
oh	3137	A
well right now we don't have any pets we've uh we've tried various things we you know obviously do have children	3137	A
and uh we tried a dog first and we had a a puppy a uh	3137	A
a what did they call him a Westie	3137	A
they're small uh-huh it's a terrier and uh that didn't work out very well	3137	A
and uh for a variety of reasons but the	3137	A
the dog was just all mouth and teeth it seemed like the only way it could of show affection was by nibbling you- on things	3137	A
yeah so it it never worked out and uh	3137	A
so we we have we gave up on that and then we tried cats	3137	A
and we ended up with a	3137	A
a bad set of cats if that's possible but i'm a i'm a big fan of cats i always had cats growing up	3137	A
and uh my wife on the other hand was not a fan of cats at all but we had these two that they we knew someone that uh uh you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and	3137	A
uh so we gave it a try	3137	A
and uh they were impossible to house train	3137	A
that's the end of that and these it was real strange and uh they were both solid white cats	3137	A
and uh one had blue eyes and the other had white- regular you know yellow eyed cats	3137	A
brothers and sisters and we had them declawed and we had them neutered and uh invested all all that money in it into it but uh we simply one of them in particular we just could not uh	3137	A
train to use we tried different types of litter changed it frequently and it was just unbelievable	3137	A
and so we finally found someone else that was willing to to to give it a try with them	3137	A
and sure enough it it worked- worked- worked for a little while and then they too couldn't seem to get them to use the litter box	3137	A
uh so they ended up finding someone else that was willing to give it a try and that's when i lost track of these two cats	3137	A
hum	3137	A
right	3137	A
right	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
good grief	3137	A
i'll bet yeah	3137	A
right-	3137	A
well that's great	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
is it primarily outdoor cat then or just	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
that's interesting	3137	A
he'll show up huh	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
great	3137	A
well has the cat discovered the uh the hamsters yet	3137	A
oh	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
oh my goodness	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
i'll be and my sister has tried that with both hamsters gerbils and small- birds	3137	A
and it's amazing what their cat has been able to do	3137	A
i think that pretty much over time has figured out a way to get those small creatures	3137	A
eventually to get them out to get the cage down from wherever it is even if it's the top of the refrigerator	3137	A
to get that cage down and into it somehow	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
well i would like to we shall see i want it to be a you know indoor outdoor animal next time	3137	A
and uh	3137	A
okay how's the weather been in Plano	3185	A
right- yeah this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city	3185	A
uh well i don't know about you but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks	3185	A
and i'm ready for it to come back	3185	A
well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty five when we woke up and sixty six	3185	A
and today and i when i got up the the temperature said more like of course seventy nine or eighty	3185	A
so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather	3185	A
you don't are you a summer person	3185	A
are you	3185	A
well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i- i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as the	3185	A
my husband's from Nebraska and they have more of the four seasons	3185	A
oh you're used to that too	3185	A
you don't like the cold well i usually like it about sweater weather and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long it goes from hot and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer and then it's cold	3185	A
and i wish it were several months of that	3185	A
no	3185	A
oh yeah	3185	A
well sure it does that kind of schedule you really need a lot more sunshine	3185	A
and also the evenings are going to be getting uh darker sooner	3185	A
because as it gets cooler	3185	A
but i did a walk last night and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler	3185	A
well i agree absolutely and you know it's all relative because i was from west Texas and it was very dry and so i thought Dallas was awful	3185	A
and i still think so but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week and it was so humid there	3185	A
that your um all your windows were were wet every morning they had to get the squeegees and clean them off and when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because_1 it's kind of like what you're used to but i agree with you the humidity especially for curly heads like me	3185	A
yes i do not like the humidity	3185	A
um-hum	3185	A
yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does	3185	A
so uh but i- i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like i guess my my best would be probably	3185	A
sixty eight when you wake up or sixty six and then probably seventy five during the day	3185	A
yeah yeah are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds	3185	A
yeah so	3185	A
yeah just keep it there	3185	A
yeah	3185	A
well i do too i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of	3185	A
negative on it but then we started thinking especially in Plano the weather is so hot in August that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow	3185	A
static here	3185	A
yeah	3185	A
we do too i think a lot of people agree the same	3185	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3185	A
uh-huh now there have been worse summers in fact this morning when they were talking about uh Harold Taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder	3185	A
of the summers	3185	A
and milder fall everybody seems to be you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because_1 they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're just	3185	A
melting and then you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings and we'll it'll be too cold and they'll say well those are the ones that like the cold weather	3185	A
oh yeah he did he did it was it was really a shame he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them_1 did	3185	A
it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes	3185	A
oh is that right okay	3185	A
oh good	3185	A
well good well then have a good day and i hope you enjoy the weather this week	3185	A
basically about the same as what you've probably had	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
oh you like the rain do you	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
oh are you i don't care for that as much i'm a summer person i like the heat	3185	B
yeah and i'm from Utah so i- i like the four seasons i just don't like the cold	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
the thing the other thing is the i don't like the rain either	3185	B
well we have several children that are in sports and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on	3185	B
so	3185	B
i like it better that way um-hum	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
the thing about when it gets hot here is i don't like the humidity that i really don't care for that	3185	B
oh really	3185	B
oh is that right well another reason well i guess i can't say that it	3185	B
i don't like the rain completely we have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden and you know even i don't know	3185	B
if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain or it seems they thrive when it rains they just really	3185	B
um-hum yeah	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
well	3185	B
well i like seventies i like seventies okay	3185	B
oh i don't like nineties you can give me seventies and you can give me eighties and i'm okay but when it gets too hot then it's that i don't like that i stay in the house because it's just	3185	B
it's just too hot	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
that's okay um i've i've thought about that too and um when we take our vacations we we do take them_1 in August sometimes so that we can be away from here	3185	B
it just really gets way when it gets way too hot it's	3185	B
and we've been here for several years and we've been here years when it's been hundreds	3185	B
and	3185	B
years um-hum	3185	B
yeah	3185	B
yeah he he always did such a good job i thought	3185	B
a good weatherman	3185	B
yeah	3185	B
anyway um	3185	B
i guess it's	3185	B
that's okay they say when you're done you're done so yeah i you don't have to wait for them_1 to say you're- cut off your time you just say have a good day or whatever you say you too	3185	B
you too	3185	B
you go ahead and start tell me how you'd you'd organize	3199	A
okay the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought first of all you needed to	3199	A
kind of about the same time every year like the same week of the the same month	3199	A
and and then you'd have to send out	3199	A
uh you know good flyers and then mail to all that you wanted to attend	3199	A
and of course food and fun are going to be your your	3199	A
ways to get people there um the ones that i've attended	3199	A
some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some of course just have lunch or	3199	A
um also like at Christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion	3199	A
and	3199	A
uh all kinds of events are usually held	3199	A
i've seen talents for mainly the kids that are there and	3199	A
you need probably information about your ancestors to tie that tie you together-	3199	A
well why don't you start because_1 you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind	3199	B
is uh kind of fun it's best done when you have leisure time and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now and	3169	A
i grew up in an area that uh it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had	3169	A
a variety of boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats	3169	A
um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer	3169	A
couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and	3169	A
got a new canvas sail for it and had a real huge- big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and	3169	A
we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice	3169	A
learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and	3169	A
um more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the storm- front blowing in and soon as the front came over	3169	A
it's it's a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess	3169	A
what are your memories of boating or current	3169	A
right	3169	A
it's true	3169	A
yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres	3169	A
and it was uh it had a lot of um	3169	A
turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go	3169	A
and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and snatched-	3169	A
pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and	3169	A
so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and	3169	A
before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up	3169	A
and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've i've uh	3169	A
done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i	3169	A
i- i know how	3169	A
you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess	3169	A
so life changes a little bit in that respect i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards i haven't	3169	A
craft- managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh	3169	A
yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of work-	3169	A
i'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something	3169	A
um about the only memories that i have of boating um my husband's family had a a motor boat um when we got engaged	3169	B
and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i- i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh	3169	B
driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting um	3169	B
you know they you they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the	3169	B
the laws were there and if you didn't obey them_1 uh	3169	B
you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but um i found the motor boating was real fun	3169	B
oh	3169	B
that sounds like a real challenge	3169	B
uh-huh	3169	B
hm	3169	B
well my son	3169	B
i guess that's all i do	3157	A
yeah	3157	A
um well i was thinking	3157	A
how the government has changed over in uh Europe and Russia	3157	A
you know	3157	A
all those countries becoming democratic for one thing	3157	A
um-hum	3157	A
i'm twenty seven	3157	A
um-hum	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
so it	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
and then i was thinking about how uh women's roles have changed	3157	A
uh	3157	A
i'm twenty seven by the way i was born in sixty four	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
okay	3157	A
okay	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
huh	3157	A
uh-huh that's true	3157	A
because_1 we might be liberated but now we all have to work and support ourselves and	3157	A
but uh it has it's pluses and minuses i guess	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
it's like a luxury now	3157	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3157	A
yeah it's hard work but it's like you have to have a husband that makes very good money in order to do that i guess	3157	A
uh-huh that's true	3157	A
well like uh my sister's younger than i am and i think that uh like they're all um	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh it's scary	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
yeah i guess like in the sixties and the seventies i was	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
the other way	3157	A
uh-huh i think you're right	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
unless they can get a cure	3157	A
unless they find a cure real soon	3157	A
for AIDS	3157	A
no i'm single	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
yes	3157	A
and uh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
can you think of any other social issues government um	3157	A
uh do you have any idea how long we have to talk	3157	A
oh i didn't even look at the clock did you	3157	A
okay	3157	A
same here	3157	A
nice nice meeting you bye-bye	3157	A
is that it	3157	B
okay start them off	3157	B
oh yeah	3157	B
well uh i don't know what your age is but i know when i was growing up that uh	3157	B
communism course the big threat of communism {McCarthyism} back in the fifties and	3157	B
and everything there we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to get us and now	3157	B
communism is no more	3157	B
so that makes a huge difference to us	3157	B
uh	3157	B
pardon me	3157	B
you were born in sixty four okay i'm older than that i'm forty four	3157	B
i was born in forty seven so i've got a couple years on you and i can tell you that things	3157	B
things have changed a tremendous amount for women in the world	3157	B
since i you know first started	3157	B
i'm not sure i i'm not sure they're better	3157	B
that's true	3157	B
yeah i feel sorry for women who truly do wish to	3157	B
kind of follow the the older tradition and stay home and raise their family take care of the kids and people say what you don't work	3157	B
well yes i work all day long thank you very much	3157	B
yeah the cost the cost of living has gone	3157	B
just sky rocketed	3157	B
what do you think as far as the	3157	B
social morals the morals of people today as opposed to	3157	B
hum	3157	B
i i i really do i feel you know i look back and i have two children i have a daughter who's fifteen and my son is twenty	3157	B
and i mean it's very scary because_1 they are living in a totally different time with totally different fears	3157	B
than i grew up in	3157	B
you know	3157	B
five years ago	3157	B
even ten years ago before the threat of AIDS entered	3157	B
uh	3157	B
i think things were people were even possibly more promiscuous	3157	B
because you know well it was live and let live and everybody have a good time and we won't even think about the consequences	3157	B
i think the seventies maybe even the well in the eighties we started getting a	3157	B
a taste of it uh and people started saying whoa wait a minute	3157	B
and i don't know i think there may even be a turnabout	3157	B
in the nineties not immediately	3157	B
but as people become more and more	3157	B
terrified of the AIDS virus	3157	B
uh i think they're going to pull back sexually	3157	B
i think they're going to pull back and we may find the pendulum swings you know	3157	B
back the other way somewhat	3157	B
i i think we it has to	3157	B
or our uh we we won't survive our our world won't survive	3157	B
uh	3157	B
do you have children	3157	B
you're single then you are in the midst of this	3157	B
yeah it	3157	B
it's a different world for us	3157	B
no	3157	B
just three minutes	3157	B
oh yeah it's been three minutes dear	3157	B
okay i've enjoyed talking to you	3157	B
okay bye uh-huh bye-bye	3157	B
uh oh	3157	B
yes i do	3182	B
china painting and ceramics	3182	B
i enjoy it um-hum	3182	B
i enjoy the china more	3182	B
and now that i have my eyes corrected to the point that i can see the delicate part of china painting i do enjoy it	3182	B
my husband kept begging me and he's been dead now for twenty years so you understand that this was a long time ago	3182	B
but he finally brought me the china the book the brushes and he said i have made arrangements for your lessons	3182	B
and i said i'll do it for three months and if i don't like it that's it	3182	B
well i painted an awful lot until his death which was several years	3182	B
and it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable	3182	B
self satisfying thing i've had i	3182	B
i have sold quite a bit i give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home and then i just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it um-hum	3182	B
i have just retired	3182	B
yes	3182	B
no it's not it's a great hobby but don't retire oh it's	3182	B
oh have you- well	3182	B
wow	3182	B
oh i see-	3182	B
oh um-hum	3182	B
well if my sister is the seamstress of the two of us	3182	B
and but she doesn't china paint so we both have our expertise sided	3182	B
um what part of Ohio are you in	3182	B
yep	3182	B
yes	3182	B
well	3182	B
if you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can i mean a large flat plate hm	3182	B
that way you can get the feel of you're not cramped on these smaller objects	3182	B
that's right	3182	B
in Abilene Texas	3182	B
uh she just taught china painting um-hum and	3182	B
and when then we had so much fun there i had a friend from Albany which is about thirty six miles away	3182	B
and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home because she did our firing for us	3182	B
and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies and it was just such a delightful time	3182	B
and then after i beg pardon	3182	B
i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had to go to work after my husband's death	3182	B
so i have put it aside for a little while but i'm i have just found me an instructor to get started again um-hum	3182	B
oh i know	3182	B
of course i just have one beautiful peonies- with peonies uh umbrella stand and i have two daughters and they're both	3182	B
do you have any hobbies	3182	A
what are yours	3182	A
ooh how great	3182	A
oh uh ceramic painting	3182	A
the china more	3182	A
how did you ever get into that that sounds so interesting	3182	A
how marvelous- i	3182	A
now do you do it just for yourself or do you do it to give as gifts or do you actually sell it	3182	A
oh that sounds marvelous- now do you work outside of the home	3182	A
uh don't retire well see i don't i never uh returned to work for the past- i have stayed home for about the last nine years	3182	A
we've transferred around and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake uh on Lake Erie	3182	A
so the lake life appealed to me and my husband's working and he left it up to me if i worked or not	3182	A
so in my spare time i love to sew there aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing	3182	A
but i do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home so i enjoy doing my uh toppers for my window applications	3182	A
and things like that but uh just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great	3182	A
that is excellent	3182	A
we're in the suburb- i'm in the suburb of Cleveland and i'm about um	3182	A
fifteen miles probably from downtown Cleveland something like that and Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie and prior to this we were fifty miles west from here so we were right on the lake	3182	A
and Cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard and you do find people uh into the crafts and the things that uh	3182	A
various things for spare time but i have never heard and i have actually never run into anyone into the china painting and i'm just intrigued with it	3182	A
right where you're getting into the delicate work now do you where- where did you first get your lessons from	3182	A
through a uh an adult ed or uh strictly a china type	3182	A
oh how marvelous	3182	A
oh and it's so nice it must be so nice for you now that you're retired	3182	A
oh isn't that great and you'll probably really uh regain- regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a a class again	3182	A
okay	3154	B
well let's see well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for	3154	B
glass and	3154	B
glass and uh plastics and uh we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full i guess we collect milk- milk cartons and	3154	B
whatever plastics- other plastics are acceptable	3154	B
no no i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet	3154	B
right well no i haven't seen any so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and i'm	3154	B
kind of anxious to see them	3154	B
oh right	3154	B
right	3154	B
right	3154	B
oh	3154	B
oh of course that they did you know actually we had milk delivered to our house	3154	B
in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house	3154	B
you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there so uh	3154	B
yeah	3154	B
right right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it it it stays i mean it's just	3154	B
to see stacks and stacks of newspapers	3154	B
just to the trash is just amazing so uh	3154	B
you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty well there's a pretty- pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics	3154	B
so that's kind of encouraging i didn't know you know i- i didn't know if we started to do that i didn't know what to expect	3154	B
right	3154	B
well i guess they will shortly i guess	3154	B
oh right	3154	B
yeah	3154	B
right do you know i saw in Tom Thumb yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small Coke bottles	3154	B
and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not	3154	B
they were glass they were the glass uh well let's see they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or	3154	B
six ounce or ten ounce	3154	B
sort of a small size	3154	B
sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack	3154	B
stick them down you know uh sort of of sort of a basket type thing with the divisions right right so i just hadn't seen that in a long time	3154	B
yeah yeah well	3154	B
no he doesn't like the paper sacks and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't doesn't just	3154	B
right right	3154	B
that's nice i guess they dump it the same place i wonder where they dump that the same place	3154	B
yeah yeah well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in they have this day now that it's you know separate from the other trash pick up	3154	B
um	3154	B
no	3154	B
are are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the	3154	A
other containers yet for recycling	3154	A
well maybe they don't i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were	3154	A
yeah the	3154	A
that's going to be interesting because it's uh we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is	3154	A
uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage	3154	A
so that i don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where uh	3154	A
uh it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people	3154	A
uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh	3154	A
growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery	3154	A
would candle them and package them	3154	A
is that uh in the fifties	3154	A
uh you could say we had	3154	A
the recycling going on then that we should have now	3154	A
which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got	3154	A
a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them	3154	A
oh	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
so uh you know i look back at	3154	A
at uh my	3154	A
childhood and i'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this	3154	A
uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
yeah well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper	3154	A
uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans	3154	A
uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh	3154	A
i don't have any habits there yet and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction but	3154	A
but it just seems like on the larger scale that	3154	A
you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if uh	3154	A
if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect	3154	A
uh than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so	3154	A
outside my little town	3154	A
we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
i well that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
the carton the paper carton	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
well i mean the you- you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood	3154	A
uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty four bottles and	3154	A
and uh	3154	A
uh i'm not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now	3154	A
well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh	3154	A
doesn't really like the paper sacks	3154	A
yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise	3154	A
uh oh i'm i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh	3154	A
Neal's a person who says i like to pick it up but i don't believe in throwing it into the uh	3154	A
the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us don't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh	3154	A
to do that	3154	A
uh so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on	3154	A
well there's someplace you know if it's because_1 really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty four hours	3154	A
uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh	3154	A
so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's	3154	A
it's certainly usable material	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
right	3154	A
but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when it's one thing to send grass there but i've trimmed trees and other things which uh	3154	A
end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly but it's still natural and i just don't know	3154	A
-TV show	3179	A
huh why	3179	A
um-hum	3179	A
i like silly ones compared to now i like um Perfect Strangers	3179	A

uh i don't know if you've ever heard that joke he's like uh he said that show is prejudice because they have like the dumbest hugest black women on that show and they run down and they're like	3179	A
and its just funny you just have to see him because_1 he's like grabbing himself and	3179	A
uh-huh it's funny	3179	A

hm	3179	A
well	3179	A
huh that's the news station	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
that's like Good Morning America i think if you watch it long enough i think they repeat at least like the headlines	3179	A
and	3179	A
so	3179	A
um-hum well at least you know the news real well	3179	A
and people think are impressed by wow how do you know all this stuff	3179	A
huh	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
huh	3179	A
um trying to think of some other shows do you like The Three Stooges	3179	A

uh-huh	3179	A
my sister loves anything like that Bugs Bunny or	3179	A
hm	3179	A

hm	3179	A
i like uh i used to like Pee Wee Herman before they took it off	3179	A
Pee Wee's Playhouse	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
well they said he might do something else now like branch off a different way like maybe more adult humor or something	3179	A
yeah uh-huh i like that stuff i mean he was always a pervert you know it didn't surprise me when he got caught you know doing that	3179	A
uh-huh yep	3179	A
huh	3179	A
yeah because_1 they're repeats now or they were repeats before they took them_1 off	3179	A
uh probably LA Law	3179	B
uh i don't know i like all the court cases and uh the romance between everybody uh what about you	3179	B

i like The Price is Right too but i never get a chance to watch it	3179	B
no huh-uh	3179	B
yeah i'm always gone at eleven	3179	B

yeah i used to watch it all the time though i never missed it	3179	B
no i never heard of that oh wait is that on like at nine or ten or something yeah yeah i've watched that before it's all right	3179	B
oh okay i never seen that	3179	B
oh so i'll have to watch it tonight	3179	B
yeah i usually have the TV on just for background noise all the time	3179	B
yeah i don't i don't think it's ever off	3179	B
yeah i just turned it off when the phone rang	3179	B
no i can't stand those	3179	B
do- oh wow that's that's odd two people actually don't like them_1	3179	B
yeah i think they're the stupidest shows	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah those all right Sixty Minutes is okay	3179	B
oh really	3179	B
oh that's a good idea so television's actually useful	3179	B
yeah it seems like we have cable and there's never anything on we just have more of nothing	3179	B
oh it comes with our apartment so you're not the huh	3179	B
no huh-uh	3179	B
i'm in Pennsylvania	3179	B
oh	3179	B
hm	3179	B
no we have to have cable because_1 we're up in the mountains and you can't get anything	3179	B
but there's nothing on TV ever hardly	3179	B
oh we we can't get anything we can get like one	3179	B
without it	3179	B
it's all right i don't think it's that bad	3179	B
but there's never anything on	3179	B
it's just background noise again	3179	B
oh	3179	B
right in the middle	3179	B
yeah Center County	3179	B
yeah we don't have any TV stations in this city so they're all from other cities	3179	B
yeah i guess we watch a lot of CNN too	3179	B
yeah but it always repeats like every half hour so we watch the same thing every half hour	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah after like an hour or so you just watch everything again and again and again	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah then you get sick of watching like man not this story again you don't pay attention to anything	3179	B
no i like Laurel and Hardy though	3179	B
yeah i never got into them much	3179	B
yeah i like the Road Runner cartoons	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah they're not on that often though	3179	B
least not around here	3179	B
yeah i guess no one will be watching that anymore	3179	B
yeah that's what he started doing anyway	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah i wasn't too surprised either didn't look like him though	3179	B
all the pictures	3179	B
yeah i've seen that show twice and it was the same one both times	3179	B
i guess i never will see it anymore	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
hi um	3175	A
basically i wear pants i'm a real pants person and um like when i'm at home since and- and i'll say i'm a homemaker	3175	A
since that's my basic thing um	3175	A
i wear a pantsuit most of the time not a pantsuit i guess pants and a shirt	3175	A
and um in the summertime i wear cotton tops cotton top shirts and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters i like sweaters a lot	3175	A
and so i do that but when i go out for meetings	3175	A
uh then i will wear either uh skirts or um a dress	3175	A
and i have a couple of pantsuits because_1 those are real in at this time but	3175	A
that's basically what i do	3175	A
oh	3175	A
um-hum	3175	A
right	3175	A
well that sounds nice	3175	A
um it said the seasons do do you change much through the season or	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
yeah yeah	3175	A
right	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
then maybe	3175	A
yeah	3175	A
um well i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway and so my note change dramatically over the years if i need something new i will go and buy it	3175	A
but basically i'm a a pretty much the same in the summertime i wear the light cotton and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters	3175	A
and so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either	3175	A
and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i	3175	A
i i enjoy that but it just wouldn't be um	3175	A
smart for me to do that in my home with my children	3175	A
so i have to um	3175	A
think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i don't know if they consider that a job i don't really get paid for that	3175	A
uh often but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike	3175	A
um but it doesn't really change in my clothing style	3175	A
yeah yeah	3175	A
oh	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
oh dear	3175	A
that's not helpful	3175	A
yeah i guess so well it's been great talking to you have a great day bye	3175	A
-hello	3175	B
well i think our tastes are fairly similar- similar although i'm i government worker i do tend to i'm um a scientist	3175	B
so that technically i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes but for the most part i don't i wear fairly respectable looking shoes and	3175	B
and a pantsuit of sort- one sort or another	3175	B
and um	3175	B
i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have some- have visitors or have to give talks	3175	B
right	3175	B
no actually i guess this summer i i wore some fairly nice jeans um more than i wore- have in previous seasons	3175	B
but um no i tend to to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer	3175	B
i don't know whether they think by	3175	B
right um yeah i don't i don't	3175	B
i you know i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends	3175	B
and i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of of secretaries was you know overdress overkill sort of and	3175	B
in a sense- uh in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries	3175	B
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public	3175	B
it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here	3175	B
you know i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up	3175	B
um-hum um-hum	3175	B
right	3175	B
um-hum um-hum	3175	B
um-hum	3175	B
exactly i mean you can look businesslike in in a pantsuit- uh the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things	3175	B
yeah i'm i'm really glad about that pantsuits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics	3175	B
and so i used to have a problem when when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash	3175	B
so	3175	B
right right but otherwise now i'm i i guess we're both pretty practical	3175	B
okay well have a good day bye-bye	3175	B
um a little bit during the school year we're um	3110	B
definitely expected to wear hosiery and you know things like that although we can wear slacks	3110	B
um during during the school year and of course that's a good idea because	3110	B
i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and	3110	B
you know so it's pretty important to um i also like very much the new split skirts	3110	B
you know because then you've	3110	B
oh that's oh that's true the old culottes that's right but those are just real comfortable and um	3110	B
you know allow you the privacy and all	3110	B
the only	3110	B
uh no i think it needs to be longer probably if it's split it it varies though between the principal- from one principal to another	3110	B
there are some like	3110	B
um some principals insist that you not wear um anklet type shorts	3110	B
i mean socks	3110	B
um that you have to wear hose- you know hose but i know of other schools	3110	B
where they wear um you know anklets and	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
how embarrassing i know i hate that you really have to check on the	3110	B
check on the length well we wear the knee high ones a lot too so	3110	B
do you wear um suits very much	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
yeah right	3110	B
um-hum um-hum	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
yeah	3110	B
i am too and i	3110	B
uh i've been here seventeen years	3110	B
but i'm from	3110	B
but i'm from Illinois	3110	B
that's right that's right	3110	B
that's right	3110	B
right all right that really is nice	3110	B
i um i'm kind of a pack rat especially when it comes to clothes	3110	B
and i i mean i still have some sweaters that i had you know from before i moved down here things that were were wool or just you know really nice things and	3110	B
and really very seldom get to wear them and should certainly get rid of probably all of them	3110	B
but like i said i'm kind of a	3110	B
at the beginning of the winter	3110	B
now that is silly isn't it	3110	B
yeah	3110	B
are you from here then	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
well the thing is that you know it it does get cold but it's just such a short season you know and you just	3110	B
can't wear that much	3110	B
oh how nice	3110	B
Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit	3110	B
huh where have you found them	3110	B
um but they carry them_1 at Dillard's	3110	B
hum i'll have to look at those that sounds interesting	3110	B
um-hum um-hum well you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and i i really do too i just i don't know i'm really comfortable in	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
um-hum i like that too	3110	B
that's real good very well	3110	B
that's exactly right	3110	B
oh well	3110	B
for work	3110	B
well you you work year round right yeah	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
um-hum that's true	3110	B
yeah that's true well i have more summer stuff i guess	3110	B
for that kind of casual because_1	3110	B
we do go on a um	3110	B
i go back to Illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husband's	3110	B
mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there so	3110	B
uh in fact i was thinking this summer that since i'm doing summer school i haven't	3110	B
worn hardly- very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them_1 all together so	3110	B
to take them_1 on our trip	3110	B
oh how nice	3110	B
well i took i went through my closet this spring and i	3110	B
i took some stuff out	3110	B
and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because i'm so tired of looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight	3110	B
but it isn't so much too tight i mean i could easily well maybe not too easily but i could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and you know and there are things that i really don't want to get rid of you know i really want	3110	B
to keep them because they're nice and so i thought well i'll put them_1 in there and then maybe i'll feel so bad that i can't wear them now	3110	B
but so far	3110	B
oh that's funny	3110	B
yeah that's right hey when you have kids you definitely have to have	3110	B
oh	3110	B
you think they're hinting	3110	B
yeah that's right	3110	B
ooh yeah you'll be glad believe me oh because_1	3110	B
um	3110	B
oh	3110	B
it's just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is	3110	B
um is when the kids get	3110	B
old enough that they really care what they're wearing	3110	B
my kids are twelve and fifteen	3110	B
on the other hand they can be pretty picky and you know	3110	B
i mean i could get away with	3110	B
you know with	3110	B
it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because	3110	B
they didn't care	3110	B
anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of	3110	B
certain kind of jeans and the the shoes are just about the worst	3110	B
uh	3110	B
gee um my son just came out the other day and he's his	3110	B
what is it i think they're Reebok	3110	B
whatever my other son has Nike Airs at the moment but these Reeboks	3110	B
and i was thinking he bought them in March	3110	B
it was early March he bought them and they are demolished	3110	B
i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them	3110	B
the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean that's how worn out they are	3110	B
and they cost- i bought them on a wonderful sale at Mervyn's they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars	3110	B
on that much of a sale	3110	B
and my husband and i were just talking you know it's	3110	B
i mean we're talking minimum of three of those a year	3110	B
that's a hundred and eighty dollars a year for his tennis shoes	3110	B
you know and my husband	3110	B
oh it's just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of of really good you know work leather nice	3110	B
men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes he said	3110	B
but i'll be- still be wearing them in ten years	3110	B
so anyway	3110	B
before we go visit grandma	3110	B
okay so uh during the summertime do you dress differently than than you would when school's going on	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
oh really	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
but those aren't that new i mean i have some that were way old yeah	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
yeah they're very nice do you can you get away with wearing the shorter ones style the ones that really look like shorts kind of	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses i when i dress to go to work my dresses are pretty long and um	3110	A
i couldn't find any hose one day but i found some knee highs so i put those on and the wind caught my skirt and he said what have you got on	3110	A
yeah it was real funny	3110	A
yeah it's pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so	3110	A
the one day that i did it and i got caught	3110	A
um no i really don't my don't- i work for a computer company but it's not uh real visual i mean it's not like an IBM where you have to wear your blue suit	3110	A
but um i can get away with wearing dresses a lot which i really enjoy	3110	A
because especially i mean you know it's nice sometimes in in a suit because if you're hot inside or cold or you know whatever you have your jacket but uh i'm more comfortable in a dress	3110	A
so but	3110	A
the best thing are you from Texas	3110	A
oh well you qualify	3110	A
oh well see that's what's so funny because_1 so many girls move down here from the north and they have these heavy wool suits and it's like God what do i do with that	3110	A
i said well that's the best part about Texas you can buy uh one dress that you can wear pretty much all through unless like it's the like- two cold months and winter- in December	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
um-hum	3110	A
yeah but you'd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale	3110	A
really hum	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well that's really weird because_1 last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so	3110	A
well yeah Oklahoma and Texas so i mean Oklahoma did get colder in the winter but um i guess i just didn't notice it because_1 i never really dressed very warm so	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well and i found a new dressmaker so that i just am crazy about the style of the dresses so	3110	A
i've been yeah i mean i go into every store and i i go do you have Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like i'm strange but	3110	A
it's called Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit and they are the neatest dresses they just are very flattering to your figure and um	3110	A
um i've been fortunate i've found them in in a catalog and then they're a lot cheaper than you can find them_1 at Dillard's	3110	A
so um	3110	A
yeah they do have them_1 at Dillard's and	3110	A
yeah i really enjoy them_1 i've gotten- i've and it's real funny too because i've had a lot of compliments on them_1 when i wear them so	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well i'm short and i've been told that if you wear the longer skirt it gives you it- it gives you more of an elongated look	3110	A
so um i've always been more comfortable in the longer ones	3110	A
so	3110	A
but anyway but i don't have any play clothes because_1 i spend all my money on clothes that i wear to work	3110	A
so on the weekends and	3110	A
yeah but it's just kind of frustrating because_1 on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes	3110	A
so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend	3110	A
put them_1 with my shorts or something	3110	A
um	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah well i've lost weight recently so i'm now getting to dig out the things that i haven't worn for a while so that's kind of fun	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
yeah well that's something my husband says what are we going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of those because_1 i i have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and it's like what are we going to do	3110	A
said well we'll have to get a bigger house	3110	A
oh i know and then plus- well my sisters have had their children and so now they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me	3110	A
and i'm like well what am i going to do with all this stuff	3110	A
i don't think it will fit my dog	3110	A
yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because_1 then i've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a boy and a girl	3110	A
so that worked out yeah	3110	A
sure i will be because_1 God- i was i was in Foley's the other day and i turned the wrong direction and i ended up in the little kids' clothes and i just picked up something for my niece and it was just it was like thirty bucks i thought golly	3110	A
oh yeah i can imagine	3110	A
oh	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
um-hum	3110	A
yeah definitely	3110	A
oh God yeah i can imagine	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
oh	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
wow	3110	A
on sale	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
maybe i won't have kids	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
wow	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
oh no	3110	A
i just can't imagine	3110	A
yeah really well my mother had three girls but i don't remember being that picky about my clothes-	3110	A
i'm Doug	3197	A
from Pennsylvania	3197	A
yeah okay so anyway now we're talking about drug testing an all that and you ready okay so what do you think about it	3197	A
right- right i agree with you basically so might be a boring conversation but um but anyway i agree that	3197	A
um only when there's any question of safety does the employer have a right because otherwise i feel that	3197	A
the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance whether you're able to do the job up to par and	3197	A
that and if that can be done it shouldn't matter whatever the employee might do in his private life	3197	A
okay	3197	A
yeah	3197	A
yeah that	3197	A
well probably at least on the average	3197	A
uh-huh	3197	A
yeah	3197	A
um-hum	3197	A
right certainly and certainly in any case people who drink alcohol a lot are probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs don't include that	3197	A
they're really interested in looking for illegal drugs it seems to be more for the purpose of law enforcement than for	3197	A
the purpose of the employer's best interest for the job	3197	A
yeah um	3197	A
well we're supposed	3197	A
uh that's Miles Davis yeah	3197	A
uh right exactly it's on the radio	3197	A
um so	3197	A
anyway	3197	A
right	3197	A
okay	3197	A
yeah i guess not and i think we've said about what we have to say sure thing bye bye	3197	A
hi how you doing Doug my name's Brad where- where you from	3197	B
oh okay i'm from New York	3197	B
right right	3197	B
yep okay	3197	B
oh i definitely i- i think it shouldn't be if it may be the only exception is when there's public safety involved you know bus drivers uh train train motormen stuff like that you know	3197	B
right	3197	B
uh you know but i- i- i think that uh i mean people think that they have an interest in in finding things like this out about their employers because it's	3197	B
probably and and maybe it's true that that if if you if you tested people and if they were drug users	3197	B
probably i mean i might even agree with you that they're probably gonna to be less productive employees um i'm not sure about that but i would say that that that may be that might be a good indication	3197	B
but but you could also you might be able to tell by a person's uh you know whether they're overweight or underweight	3197	B
uh you know you might make certain value judgments about that you can make value judgments probably about- about a number of different things that are clearly within the realm of someone's private ability	3197	B
you know private- you know private interest or or you know i'm trying looking for a word in other words you know maybe maybe uh heavier people uh	3197	B
tend to not be as good workers you know or maybe maybe extra uh uh ultra thin people tend to not be as good workers maybe people that smoke cigarettes aren't as good workers uh you know	3197	B
sure	3197	B
yeah yeah	3197	B
that's true that's true	3197	B
so we could talk about pets that was my last subject you know	3197	B
what's that music in the background	3197	B
oh okay a little tribute to him or	3197	B
ah	3197	B
that's a good background for this conversation all right well anyhow nice talking to you i- i don't think we have to stay on the whole time and we've we've agreed too much	3197	B
okay take care have a good day bye bye	3197	B
um-hum	3194	A
that's okay	3194	A
that's okay it it's more uh concentrated so they know where you are	3194	A
um anyway uh i know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are um Kroger and some of the other stores too have said	3194	A
if you bring your bags back to uh to the store to recycle	3194	A
then they'll pay you a certain amount of money and that's one thing that started in the community	3194	A
um-hum	3194	A
um-hum yeah i know Kroger will do it and i think Albertson's does it sometimes i'm not sure	3194	A
um and and yet i know that uh	3194	A
some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the	3194	A
the uh community like through the schools or things like that	3194	A
so um that's always helpful and i know that we have- we have the the can	3194	A
the can different can banks around the city	3194	A
that you can go to and do that	3194	A
um one of the ways i don't know uh if this would be helpful it said on the	3194	A
the computer what do i think would be helpful and i don't know if it would be helpful or not but i know on Monday the the garbage men pick up like just	3194	A
um	3194	A
uh any limbs or any extra trash that you might have	3194	A
and that might be an extra day to put out uh things that might be recycled if we had a a certain	3194	A
colored can to put them_1 in or or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
uh i know getting a newspaper everyday i know i could just you know	3194	A
do that	3194	A
because i have to pick it up and it just goes out with our trash and i guess i'm not as um	3194	A
recycling minded as i should be but uh that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled	3194	A
so	3194	A
did you	3194	A
tell me	3194	A
um-hum	3194	A
now do you have to take like labels off of those jars	3194	A
uh-huh	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
take them_1 off yeah	3194	A
soda both liter sodas can you do that okay	3194	A
right right	3194	A
i i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just um get it into different categories like that and	3194	A
i- i don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it i	3194	A
i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know	3194	A
okay_1	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
uh-huh	3194	A
oh	3194	A
all set actually i'm in Plano too i say Dallas area when i'm talking to people elsewhere	3194	B
yeah	3194	B
they actually pay you money for that hm um Brookshires up in Allen	3194	B
uh you bring your bags back you know they uh the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them_1 in the one of the receptacles there but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that hm	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
interesting	3194	B
right	3194	B
right	3194	B
yeah i think they already do that out east um they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go it's uh it's pretty bad all these years we've been	3194	B
especially in this country all the uh	3194	B
the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and uh so what i do is uh	3194	B
it's not bad you just have to have a place to keep everything but uh it you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it	3194	B
just put your paper in the same place every day and it'll start stacking up take your glass um you know pickle jars or or whatever um uh liquid jars you know and just	3194	B
rinse them_1 out a little bit and put them all in a place and uh plastics	3194	B
no from what i understand uh you can leave the labels on um although i rip rip them_1 off i don't i don't scrub them_1 or anything i just tear them_1 off	3194	B
throw the lids and everything out but uh put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs uh orange juice jugs things like that	3194	B
yes those also um and then of course uh cans Coke cans whatever	3194	B
but uh you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up there's a lot that we throw out	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
it's yeah it's not a big deal you get used to it one let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and uh	3194	B
and i said hey um i understand y'all are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them and they had told me that when they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there	3194	B
and they said well you know people come in and put anything in the receptacles and what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags Kroger or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them_1	3194	B
yeah and it's it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number like um bags from Drug Emporium have a four-	3194	B
okay um does is this something that concerns you	3143	B
uh-huh	3143	B
right	3143	B
yeah well i live outside of Dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year	3143	B
in Dallas and that worries me	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
yeah there's a little boy that just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is	3143	B
you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet	3143	B
that's really sad i've so you know it must be frustrating-	3143	B
frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that	3143	B
be so scary	3143	B
it really doesn't it's kind of scary i think that uh	3143	B
i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient	3143	B
i think that's part of the problem	3143	B
yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded you know let them suffer a little bit	3143	B
yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it	3143	B
yeah it- the other thing that worries me about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill	3143	B
people they i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
oh	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
seems like if they had immediate- more immediate uh consequences to their actions it would sink in faster	3143	B
really yeah	3143	B
yeah because_1 it seems like now even in the country you hear about	3143	B
bad things happening so	3143	B
yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools	3143	B
me either	3143	B
yeah seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that	3143	B
it seems scarier	3143	B
really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah that's scary it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore	3143	B
yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because	3143	B
they won't let them hire any new ones and they keep leaving	3143	B
huh yeah they figure what a heyday huh	3143	B
it really is well there's someone at the door so i guess i'll have to go see what my dog is barking about but it was nice talking to you	3143	B
well thanks same for you bye	3143	B
well i think it does um especially because i just moved to Massachusetts and uh they're having real problems because they have so many uh police layoffs	3143	A
and uh personally i don't live in a real bad section of town but uh just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car and there's a lot of crime within a few miles of me	3143	A
how about you	3143	A
yeah i uh	3143	A
yeah i recently moved here and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town and uh my husband was was what he his concerns were well not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just	3143	A
be an innocent bystander just to be in that location and i thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way	3143	A
but	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
yeah that exactly-	3143	A
exactly what happened down here	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime and it doesn't seem like anything is working	3143	A
but in in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes	3143	A
that's true maybe the punishment should be more severe	3143	A
i know it	3143	A
yeah	3143	A
exactly- exactly- exactly because they get involved in things so young that they don't really realize what they're involved in	3143	A
and uh some people prey on that you know they'll take uh kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen	3143	A
and uh get them involved in things because	3143	A
uh well i don't know i was watching on a movie on TV i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything	3143	A
so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial	3143	A
i think it would concern me even more if i had children which i don't but if i had children i wouldn't know where to raise them to protect them	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
it's true they uh and they they talk about too the gangs	3143	A
spreading you know like everybody thinks of them only in LA and New York but they spread out	3143	A
to cover more area and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in Texas do they	3143	A
that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group and i think that a lot of people that sort of control them	3143	A
control what they're doing are older you know business you know trying to control whatever you know	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
it's true and the weapons my God the weapons that people have are some people are more- seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
that's the other thing uh is	3143	A
it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday	3143	A
i	3143	A
uh	3143	A
yeah i just read an article yesterday um where this what used to be a nice town in this area	3143	A
they had a lot of budget cutbacks	3143	A
Massachusetts is broke right now and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well	3143	A
and so it's like	3143	A
this is a depressing conversation though	3143	A
okay i hope things look up	3143	A
bye-bye	3143	A
uh-huh	3142	A
yes	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
do you usually go out uh with the children or without them	3142	A
right	3142	A
yes	3142	A
yes	3142	A
yes	3142	A
well i	3142	A
no i-	3142	A
uh well uh we don't have any children so uh we tend to like to try all sorts of different things and uh we're very attracted to exotic food	3142	A
and uh we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and uh sort of gourmet Mexican and uh things like that	3142	A
as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and uh Chinese and things and and things of that sort now yes of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too	3142	A
and uh we probably go out one to two times a week	3142	A
and uh	3142	A
uh we're pretty much regulars at an Italian local Italian restaurant	3142	A
Momo's	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
i've heard about it i haven't been in there	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
that's- that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me	3142	A
i i like different kinds of food so when we go out i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican restaurant like something other than uh you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and	3142	A
fajitas now	3142	A
yes yes and once in a while things backfire i mean we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that and i'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try we'll try anything just about Ethiopian we've had Ethiopian	3142	A
and uh not in Plano of course but we really we really do enjoy going out and uh and i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires	3142	A
yeah i think that we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant how do you usually find a a new restaurant	3142	A
uh-huh so do we	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
right	3142	A
uh-huh we have found uh a number of restaurants either through D and the Friday paper and sometimes the the Observer which my husband usually picks up	3142	A
and also through coupons when a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons and you know when they say you know buy one get one free	3142	A
it's hard to resist so we'll go in and very often we'll find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they give they they no longer give coupons we'll we'll uh we'll stay there	3142	A
but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper- through the newspaper reviews	3142	A
i mean it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that	3142	A
it's very expensive to go out to eat	3142	A
so yeah that that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us	3142	A
yeah	3142	A
yes	3142	A
uh	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
oh absolutely	3142	A
and do the dishes	3142	A
oh yes	3142	A
oh my- my- my sister who also lives here in Dallas uh tends to uh chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty	3142	A
but	3142	A
what's your favorite restaurant	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
sure	3142	A
you know we've never been there and that's supposed to be wonderful	3142	A
um	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
ooh	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
i would probably like that one or two times in my life i've ever had venison i've loved it but you know just it's just not i don't know people who hunt so	3142	A
uh God that's that's supposed to be a wonderful place well- uh uh uh here in Plano	3142	A
well we tend to go to Momo's a lot- fairly often and uh	3142	A
sometimes we'll go you know we we also go to Chili's and uh Colter's Bar B Q and and uh	3142	A
we go to little- there is a little Thai place that's over on park that we go to my husband particularly likes that	3142	A
we go into Dallas a lot and because we're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently and uh we'll go down to uh Blue Mesa Grill for Mexican food and	3142	A
oh	3142	A
okay well i guess i enjoy eating out um uh here and there or	3142	B
it's it's a good change and good change from cooking and eating at home and i guess i like a variety of a variety of restaurants	3142	B
uh sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and	3142	B
and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal and sometimes	3142	B
it's i enjoy going out having a formal meal	3142	B
and uh	3142	B
sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad	3142	B
something you know	3142	B
well a variety i i like to go sometimes without them and sometimes i sometimes it's okay to take them along so sometimes i think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches so uh	3142	B
it just you know it just varies we do a mix sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet -without little ones at the table	3142	B
so uh	3142	B
i guess i guess actually on those those times uh we even there are times i even say oh please don't sit us next to a table with other children	3142	B
this is our night out so	3142	B
but uh anyway where do you like to eat	3142	B
uh-huh	3142	B
right	3142	B
right	3142	B
oh which one do you like	3142	B
oh okay well it's been a long time since we've been in there but uh but it's good there's an Italian restaurant over over by the mall over by uh Plano Parkway there past- oh is it Campari's or something	3142	B
well it's good i haven't my husband had been in there several times and we went in there actually we went in there for lunch one day and uh their pastas were great	3142	B
you're brave	3142	B
oh God	3142	B
right	3142	B
oh well even though traditional it can backfire	3142	B
uh	3142	B
well my husband's kind of the ethnic- he he's the ethnic fan so he's i don't know you know what we read we read the uh D magazine	3142	B
we we check that and uh the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there they often do ratings of restaurants so uh we've	3142	B
uh we've usually we often save those and adventured out on from there	3142	B
uh just for something that had a high rating	3142	B
okay	3142	B
that's	3142	B
that's right	3142	B
oh good oh good	3142	B
oh oh yeah we i guess we we use the coupons too that's true that's true	3142	B
oh right right	3142	B
right	3142	B
well i think that it's just that's exactly- sometimes i think going out to eat it's it's sort of a recreation	3142	B
so uh just a just a change of pace	3142	B
from uh	3142	B
eating at home so uh anyway i guess uh as far as as far as service when we go out gosh it's nice it's nice to have somebody come and wait the table and clear the table and	3142	B
yeah and do the dishes and uh actually it's kind of nice to you know i always uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive	3142	B
so uh we've had experience with that too so	3142	B
oh yeah	3142	B
gosh i guess just in Plano i Plano i like to go to Souper Salads	3142	B
uh Chili's Chili's is always fine	3142	B
i guess if we go to Dallas into Dallas we like uh	3142	B
the Routh is it Routh Street Cafe	3142	B
we	3142	B
well you would like it you'd like it especially it you're adventuresome	3142	B
it just we've we've taken people there several times and uh they have a good they have a good choice of of things that are very different sounding i guess it's whether you call it Southwestern	3142	B
but uh oh we had venison	3142	B
venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful	3142	B
and then i guess it must be seasonal and we've been back oh i guess it's in the winter season well they've never had it when we've been back so but uh well you ought to try that it's it's it's very good	3142	B
no	3142	B
oh that's good yes i've been there	3142	B
yeah i do	3136	A
oh really	3136	A
did you plant those yourself	3136	A
oh	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
oh	3136	A
that's nice oh i love blackberries and we we- uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i	3136	A
but i don't have any down here	3136	A
oh i think i know what they i can't remember what the name of them is- are- are either	3136	A
oh	3136	A
down here the grass	3136	A
well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and	3136	A
and i know they must think you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that	3136	A
that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees	3136	A
i know and she's eaten the bushes i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it	3136	A
and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad	3136	A
so i can't do anything back there because_1 she just she destroys it	3136	A
but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came	3136	A
i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i put- put out front and it killed those too so uh i'm i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything	3136	A
i yeah that that happened to us we have these	3136	A
i know	3136	A
oh i know ours don't	3136	A
i know we can't either but i've got pretty- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard	3136	A
and- and they're big and they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath	3136	A
where the leaves are shading the tree but	3136	A
toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's just it's a never ending cycle	3136	A
yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
huh	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
really and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front	3136	A
and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch	3136	A
so there's not really much i can do about that	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
i do too that's why i look at my neighbors yard i don't have anything to look at so i look at theirs	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
yeah it it's really a pain my husband works a lot so um a lot	3136	A
yeah i'm it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and	3136	A
and i just i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard	3136	A
yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself	3136	A
whether he likes it or not	3136	A
oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him	3136	A
that's why i'm help having him help me now	3136	A
okay i i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes i don't know how long you've been here	3136	B
but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we don't have any	3136	B
but we do have some blackberry bushes and and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them	3136	B
um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the kids- i had to the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries	3136	B
but uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot	3136	B
and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them and they're okay	3136	B
yeah um	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah uh we have some flowers that have they just are real hearty also and they're bulbs and they come up every year	3136	B
but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out	3136	B
and uh	3136	B
there a i don't know what kind of flowers they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of uh	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
no but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain	3136	B
and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um do that now as far as our grass it grows	3136	B
crazy it just keeps growing and growing	3136	B
and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it but it just is	3136	B
i don't i don't know i've lived in Utah my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green i don't know yeah	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
crappy i know we have that too	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
oh dear	3136	B
no uh-huh	3136	B
had somehow gotten in yeah yeah	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
the the other problem that we have well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived	3136	B
uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too	3136	B
they had no right to live but anyway	3136	B
uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them you know we just can't grow uh grass underneath there	3136	B
um-hum	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
right	3136	B
it's a vicious cycle isn't it it's really	3136	B
well i don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up um	3136	B
you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live	3136	B
and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the	3136	B
i think that's pretty much what we have decided now i have two long windows and i'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that	3136	B
so people can't see and hear too much it just	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
that's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um	3136	B
an office that my husband and i work in	3136	B
and so i i really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and that's where the front room is	3136	B
so that's not too bad but i like to look at the flowers they're pretty	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
but it's funny because_1 uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows	3136	B
everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and	3136	B
it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
i know it is it's not my favorite thing in the world either i'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
right exactly exactly	3136	B
uh what is- what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money	3195	A
oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it	3195	A
well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i- i manage	3195	A
no do you actually follow a budget	3195	A
well that's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown	3195	A
and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to	3195	A
and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses	3195	A
are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently	3195	A
and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to	3195	A
so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead	3195	A
and we do not buy used- ah new cars uh do you get into the car	3195	A
we do for us very much so in fact we	3195	A
are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said	3195	A
look you guys are all into car payments we haven't had car payments for so many years i love it this way	3195	A
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked	3195	A
and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it	3195	A
believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is it's the same color	3195	A
and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the same and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again	3195	A
i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five	3195	A
and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on	3195	A
this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably	3195	A
generally from dealers and uh it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual	3195	A
uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one	3195	A
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying	3195	A
don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us	3195	A
and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes	3195	A
well i we talk about it but i'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh	3195	B
um yes yeah	3195	B
i don't mind the spending it's just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so	3195	B
i see well i'm i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh	3195	B
well we pretty well do um several years we didn't and we found that we just weren't making the most of of what we had	3195	B
and so we we um set aside a certain amount each week that goes for	3195	B
things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then	3195	B
what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
right	3195	B
right	3195	B
uh-huh	3195	B
right	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
right	3195	B
well we had new cars um always until about four years ago my husband um owned his own company and it went under and so	3195	B
we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now it's just seems	3195	B
just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car um do you think that it's wiser to buy used	3195	B
right	3195	B
uh-huh	3195	B
oh no	3195	B
oh wow	3195	B
that's right	3195	B
wow	3195	B
right	3195	B
do you um buy from dealers or from individuals	3195	B
um-hum	3195	B
right	3195	B
right	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement	3121	B
uh in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time	3121	B
and so i was very much a part of all the uh you know what was going on there uh	3121	B
my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now we've seen you know uh black people have a lot more civil rights	3121	B
in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago	3121	B
there's still a lot to be you know to be accomplished but	3121	B
for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
yeah	3121	B
well that's true	3121	B
that's a good one right there	3121	B
right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family	3121	B
and so we were always at family in different people- family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that	3121	B
well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules are so busy	3121	B
mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work	3121	B
and so that means you know a lot of a lot of the social visiting and all was i think probably instigated by women at that time right and now	3121	B
that's right and now uh i mean my mother does not work and and she you know she's finds- finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women	3121	B
but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore	3121	B
there's a real	3121	B
right you know you don't want to you want to make sure it's okay or i guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever	3121	B
well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles	3121	B
and that- and most live within ten or or twenty so but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and	3121	B
most people didn't go away i'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state	3121	B
yeah there is in that area	3121	B
um-hum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social change- i use social change probably the job market has always- and the the economy has always affected uh social change	3121	B
probably	3121	B
well i think just also you know	3121	B
the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change uh people marry	3121	B
yeah people marry later	3121	B
i mean basically i think now again where i'm from in in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school	3121	B
but now out here in Texas where i am now that's very unusual	3121	B
most people get married- i mean get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to	3121	B
be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up	3121	B
right but probably uh you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change because it affects child care and uh	3121	B
but	3121	B
right	3121	B
well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties	3121	B
they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
where do they live	3121	B
well they're not too far though	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
well i live like fourteen hours from home in fact i'm	3121	B
i'm driving tomorrow- i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July	3121	B
no i can drive it all it's just me so i can make it i'm thirty five	3121	B
although it's it's it is pretty i don't know i don't enjoy it that much it's pretty much like get there and	3121	B
it's just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just don't like to drive that far	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
when you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it	3121	B
oh	3121	B
uh do you want to give a start on it	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-hum	3121	A
oh definitely	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
you can relate to that now see we didn't we don't have any of that because well like we live in the country	3121	A
in Clarion County and uh	3121	A
we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into	3121	A
so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh	3121	A
uh visiting habits of families and such uh uh	3121	A
yeah that there's less visiting done i think on a whole than there used to be used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not you went visiting	3121	A
and uh today you know people they do visit but it's not quite the same as uh what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
right	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
right right	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
the majority yeah uh-huh	3121	A
probably because when you work	3121	A
you don't really care to go out and visit as much	3121	A
and uh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
no huh-uh they don't do as much	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
you have to make arrangements or have an invitation or	3121	A
yeah yeah	3121	A
well that could be part of it i don't know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so	3121	A
we really don't have that even we don't yeah	3121	A
oh really	3121	A
oh that's pretty good yeah	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
well apparently there must be work available	3121	A
for those that are	3121	A
uh-huh because around here there's really nothing for the young people no good i mean there's jobs there's minimum wage jobs but uh to make a good living there really around here there just isn't too much	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
so well there's the main things i can think of i really	3121	A
tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really	3121	A
that	3121	A
yeah definitely some good and some bad	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
they'd rather get their life started first before uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of	3121	A
effort and concentration and if you're busy with school it's i think it's really difficult for a family	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
right right	3121	A
yeah i know my my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh she has two little boys and they they've been in day care since you know one's four and one's one	3121	A
and they've done well now i wouldn't want to do it that way but uh she's quite happy and the children seem quite adjusted	3121	A
and uh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
uh-huh yes uh-huh	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
uh-huh now i'm going to babysit my granddaughter she's just eight weeks old so this will be new for me	3121	A
so uh	3121	A
but the others i'm too far away to help them out at all	3121	A
uh well i have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh one in Maryland and one in Connecticut a son in Connecticut	3121	A
no but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and uh it's too far to you know really go too often	3121	A
Pittsburgh's not quite so bad it's just a couple hours	3121	A
Maryland maybe five hour drive	3121	A
that's	3121	A
uh-huh that's worse yet	3121	A
oh are you really	3121	A
do you uh stay overnight on the way or you	3121	A
you're young how old are you	3121	A
okay well you're young enough yet to	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
it's work to get there yeah yeah huh	3121	A
uh-huh now my son they they flew he rebuilt a Aranca Chief airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it	3121	A
and it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane	3121	A
but they enjoyed in thoroughly	3121	A
so	3121	A
i'm not sure but you have to change phones you have to call from another a different	3121	A
uh i work at TI and we have um of course started drug testing um random drug testing here and um i haven't gotten called yet but um	3174	A
i feel that it's probably pretty- it's pretty good	3174	A
if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs	3174	A
um i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at TI but i think our latest statistic- statistic said something like ninety nine point	3174	A
nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the drug- on on all the testing	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
right	3174	A
right	3174	A
right i at TI if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program and um you know you go through the program and then	3174	A
you're called like six months after you complete the program- program and if you test positive then you're terminated	3174	A
yeah uh-huh	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
um-hum oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people if they're if they're not uh you know fully functional	3174	A
mentally while they're doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to other- another people um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
oh yeah	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
so right	3174	A
right	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
oh yes um-hum	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
you know i think personally i'm for it there's	3174	A
several reason why i- i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it	3174	A
and yes and oh yeah it's very expensive and um um-hum it's not like a normal urinalysis it's very expensive to run them and um	3174	A
i didn't get a raise this year because nobody in our company got a raise	3174	A
but yet their they spend all the money on drug testing and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise so see there you know there's different	3174	A
i don't think that that's that i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem and i know that but then i have other views to it	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
right	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
their- their's might not run a thousand dollars our from what i understanding here at TI they run close to a thousand dollars an employee	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
but no for all the the	3174	A
oh it's	3174	A
do they feel that way	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
well i- i think it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to to the drugs i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it it's uh i don't know i don't really liken it	3174	B
to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think it's a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them_1 or get you off of them_1 because you're	3174	B
i don't know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them_1 into some sort of a	3174	B
program to get them off of drugs i would think that is that how they do it at TI maybe that	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
well	3174	B
you you have people out there that are responsible for certain things and you expect them to do their job and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job um as they might do	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that whatever they're taking at the time and and it would be uh	3174	B
you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the schools so i've you know had a	3174	B
they they talk a lot about drugs there and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools	3174	B
but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs you know and	3174	B
if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart and i don't know how many others are	3174	B
doing that and and i think that's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age and uh	3174	B
i don't know it's just a problem that problem- no one is sure just how to handle i think	3174	B
really it's that high	3174	B
oh	3174	B
i didn't realize it was that expensive	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
um-hum just lucky to have jobs	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
i just i didn't think it was that expensive because_1 my son was in probably a week and a half period and Sam's and Wal-Mart are are	3174	B
owned by the same people he took one for for uh Wal-Mart for job hiring and then Sam's called him and and he took another one and i you know i don't know why they both	3174	B
made him do that since it was so close together i can see if	3174	B
because you know if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted	3174	B
well maybe they run i don't know you know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health	3174	B
type program that it it it would catch a lot of things i- i just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them	3174	B
okay do you have you ever had to put your children in in child care Mary Dell	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh i see	3135	B
oh well i have uh a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool	3135	B
and uh we've just been real lucky i think anyway to not	3135	B
right like half day programs uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh	3135	B
oh my gosh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
right right yeah	3135	B
uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here	3135	B
you know to your lucky to have an art teacher and if you do you get them once a week or something you know	3135	B
oh is that right i had no idea	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to	3135	B
not going to change anytime soon	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten	3135	B
you know it's like wham culture shock it's just	3135	B
yeah yeah get the computers out and you know well that's hard it's so difficult for them um	3135	B
did you have your children did you say in home in in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home	3135	B
uh-huh so you were able to have somebody come there	3135	B
yeah yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you	3135	B
oh	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
oh	3135	B
oh gosh	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh i have uh a	3135	B
uh-huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the Home Show but they were talking about uh	3135	B
a new uh oh i can't even think of the name of it i was halfway listening while i was painting um it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children	3135	B
and they've now moved it to Washington DC and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there	3135	B
you know so um	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh boy that's great	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
right right	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
gosh it's amazing	3135	B
right right	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly	3135	B
why the government makes the decisions they do	3135	B
you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
right	3135	B
right right	3135	B
oh that's good	3135	B
that's good to know i got a couple of friends that have have found the uh	3135	B
you know a private- a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they	3135	B
usually you know you'll find a a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh too transit uh-huh	3135	B
and her surroundings too yeah	3135	B
oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now	3135	A
i worked even when she was a baby	3135	A
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist	3135	A
right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place	3135	A
so it worked well how about you	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
yeah	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong	3135	A
preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas	3135	A
but they were so seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it	3135	A
and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that	3135	A
the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there	3135	A
so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and	3135	A
real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that	3135	A
that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
or pay for it after school our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and	3135	A
you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools	3135	A
rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah	3135	A
well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes	3135	A
yeah yeah put the colors away which is too bad	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house	3135	A
and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so yeah-	3135	A
yeah	3135	A
well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money	3135	A
and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead	3135	A
so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so	3135	A
i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center	3135	A
um-hum	3135	A
um-hum	3135	A
yeah oh that would be hard	3135	A
well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or	3135	A
are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time	3135	A
for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint	3135	A
we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just wean- wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again	3135	A
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but	3135	A
i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast	3135	A
and for our age group it's too late too little too late	3135	A
but i i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
right yeah	3135	A
oh sure	3135	A
you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that	3135	A
well- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces	3135	A
so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area	3135	A
and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year	3135	A
and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to	3135	A
and well that's interesting isn't it yeah	3161	B
right	3161	B
what did you think about that idea	3161	B
hm they've not really given it attention either yeah	3161	B
right	3161	B
well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions they uh	3161	B
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because_1 they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing	3161	B
so i i would hate to have that responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address	3161	B
i uh	3161	B
i guess i it it frightens me to think of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer and	3161	B
many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other	3161	B
whether it's through	3161	B
prevention or or treatment or you know	3161	B
just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves	3161	B
so it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it	3161	B
just change our priorities-	3161	B
right just change our priorities a little bit and	3161	B
right	3161	B
the AIDS issue is	3161	A
is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how	3161	A
can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are	3161	A
on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending	3161	A
as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more people- mean more people than AIDS	3161	A
and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer	3161	A
so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh	3161	A
i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that	3161	A
whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh	3161	A
it's just one big PR campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS	3161	A
and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those	3161	A
well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded	3161	A
and uh having thought about that for a while	3161	A
well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i got- i got to thinking	3161	A
the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood antigen- antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood	3161	A
and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years	3161	A
so it's not really cure for- yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major	3161	A
uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it	3161	A
through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever	3161	A
how they fund whatever um illness they wish it's- it's kind of hard to	3161	A
to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or	3161	A
right	3161	A
right	3161	A
that's true	3161	A
you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh	3161	A
i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a	3161	A
a unfair advantage as they were but	3161	A
the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money	3161	A
uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but	3161	A
we have such an affluent -society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's	3161	A
yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but	3161	A
are they that enhancing for the masses- for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh	3161	A
had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else	3161	A
oh well that's we rent a lot of videos too um we saw i have two little babies and we saw one movie recently and that was um The Terminator movie um then which i didn't like after all	3155	B
well i don't either it on all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie he doesn't he maims them	3155	B
so	3155	B
um-hum he he uh i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part in the movie so	3155	B
oh i haven't seen that one yet	3155	B
uh-huh	3155	B
oh	3155	B
yeah well it's	3155	B
with all the commercials uh and everything i haven't that's one we wanna see i i wanna see uh Dances With Wolves but we haven't seen that one yet either on video	3155	B
yeah three that's what i heard too	3155	B
yeah we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it so we saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone Oscar	3155	B
supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy which was an interesting movie but not very funny	3155	B
unfortunately-	3155	B
did she	3155	B
well it was it was an amusing movie it just- i guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to uh at the house watching it with with no one else around so	3155	B
oh	3155	B
um-hum	3155	B
my son just turned two and so The Little Mermaid is now our favorite movie	3155	B
we've Little Mermaid and Peter Pan i think are are his two favorites that we've got	3155	B
so	3155	B
oh i haven't i didn't hear that was coming out	3155	B
well they just had uh The Rescuers movie that was a Disney movie wasn't it i think i heard that was just one was just out he's uh he doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet but he likes to uh	3155	B
to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the movie- in the movie so -that's	3155	B
well i well- tell you ever since- my my kids are just small babies and i tell you we we really want to go a lot and uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it	3155	B
sometimes	3155	B
so	3155	B
um-hum that seems to happen i noticed that Dances With Wolves was playing at the uh Granada Theater	3155	B
and uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie i thought that might be kind of fun to do	3155	B
and of course you need a babysitter for that definitely but uh you know i'd really like to get out to the movies more often course it's so expensive now too	3155	B
that you can't hardly afford it i i don't- know we get discount tickets	3155	B
where my husband works but other than that it just seems like it's so expensive and then the popcorn and everything else you almost can't afford to do it	3155	B
no matter what well we did actually get we went on vacation couple months ago and we got to go see What About Bob	3155	B
that was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray	3155	B
that was fun	3155	B
oh he's a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist and Bob is his patient	3155	B
and Bob follows him on vacation it's kind of	3155	B
um-hum um-hum	3155	B
um-hum	3155	B
yeah that's the one	3155	B
must have left an impression	3155	B
i really haven't seen any movies lately so when the computer picked this one i was a little bit surprised but i think i haven't been to the movie theater here in about oh six months but um	3155	A
you know the last movies that i've seen were probably on video	3155	A
yeah	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah now i haven't- i haven't seen The Terminator movie but and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it i don't particularly care for that sort of stuff	3155	A
yeah right yeah he maims them_1 pretty good doesn't he	3155	A
yeah uh-huh i- i saw uh Sleeping with the Enemy oh um i saw it uh oh couple weeks ago i rented it and um	3155	A
watched it and i was i was pretty disappointed in it because i- i was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense and i was pretty disappointed in it now it's- it's a good movie but i guess uh that they built me up too much	3155	A
for my expectations in it there	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah now i haven't seen it either but uh i've heard that it's real long that it's a good movie but it's long like three hours	3155	A
that's right that's right	3155	A
Oscar	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah i know my daughter saw that and she liked it so yeah	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
uh-huh and of course i get to watch all these movies like Look Who's Talking and Who's Look- Look Who's Talking Too and because_1 i have a ten year old so we we watch a lot of movies	3155	A
around that category you know that she that she can watch	3155	A
yeah we seen The Little Mermaid too	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
um-hum and there's some i think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video um Shipwrecked	3155	A
uh-huh yeah it's fixing to come out on video and boy i can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out but	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
right	3155	A
um-hum well i'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater	3155	A
yeah	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
that's right and then they go to the dollar movies	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah that does sound fun	3155	A
right	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
that's right	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
golly i don't think that i've ever heard of that movie	3155	A
oh that's the that's the one where they burn down the house or something the house explodes	3155	A
oh okay	3155	A
okay yeah another movie that i wanna see if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is um oh i just forgot the title of it um	3155	A
oh it's supposed to be a real scary one	3155	A
um	3155	A
darn well here here's another one that i've seen i saw um	3155	A
i can't remember the title of it either um yeah it really did it's it's uh	3155	A
okay well some of the things i like to do are i like to knit i knit sometimes and i sew	3158	A
and um	3158	A
i like to sew sometimes for my kids i- i sew clothes for them every once in a while and i make quilts so	3158	A
after a while cross stitch i think- i don't know i have to put it away and then i have to bring it back you know and and uh	3158	A
i don't know why that is i don't know if it's looking at the little things- little things every time	3158	A
yeah that might be it that might and yet there's uh	3158	A
oh do you	3158	A
oh	3158	A
oh i bet	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
yeah yeah	3158	A
um i've not really done any too much challenging um stuff i- i can do it with a a needle and thread you know	3158	A
but uh and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good but it's very long	3158	A
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group you're not finishing a quilt in a long time	3158	A
so uh	3158	A
so um i like to just mostly do the tie quilts that's so much easier	3158	A
but uh the other ones are very pretty they're uh we have a quilt on our bed that's uh instead of like yarn	3158	A
they tied um ribbon into it	3158	A
and it's real pretty that's real pretty	3158	A
oh wow	3158	A
uh-huh	3158	A
uh-huh	3158	A
now did you say you could knit	3158	A
oh	3158	A
well i was gonna say because_1	3158	A
because_1 if you could knit you could crochet it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to	3158	A
to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand	3158	A
and then you just use your right hand with the hook	3158	A
and that's not it's really not too difficult you could learn that i'm sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet it's not too difficult	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
isn't that interesting	3158	A
i think that's really interesting	3158	A
huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns	3158	A
that people do	3158	A
and i- i just think that um	3158	A
that's one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty	3158	A
and a lot of people don't do that either	3158	A
you know and so	3158	A
yeah yeah	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
yeah that's true you know and and i always think well i can do this while i watch TV or something you know	3158	A
and um it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else and then it doesn't	3158	A
quite work or	3158	A
yeah and	3158	A
you know i like to sketch i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that	3158	A
and that's nice and everything	3158	A
but you know it's funny i can't i can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing i wish i could and and yet i can't do you know like like uh craft uh on wood	3158	A
i can't do that painting thing and yet	3158	A
yeah me too	3158	A
me too i know a woman who's just wonderful at that and	3158	A
and i look at it and you know you look at those things and you wish so badly that you could do them_1 i guess	3158	A
if you wanted to you could take classes and learn i guess that's the only way i could do it	3158	A
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
oh wow that's the next project that i'd like to learn to do i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery	3158	B
and i'm i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch and was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt	3158	B
it gets boring	3158	B
um-hum um-hum	3158	B
well it just reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think	3158	B
but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from Plano to Dallas	3158	B
so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car	3158	B
i don't know that i could even think about quilting	3158	B
you have to have a pretty good frame don't you to do any kind of quilting work	3158	B
hm	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
oh i bet but it's such a lost art	3158	B
uh-huh yes	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
oh	3158	B
i bet	3158	B
there's so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother she had crocheted a full bedspread it's kind of a hobnail looking thing	3158	B
and when i look at it now she's been dead for a long time i think oh why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that	3158	B
people just don't know how to do	3158	B
no um-hum haven't tried that either	3158	B
i wanna learn to crochet i	3158	B
really	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
yeah yeah	3158	B
uh-huh	3158	B
it's funny when you were talking about sewing i love to do anything by hand with a needle	3158	B
but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine i never learned	3158	B
and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
well it's hard to find the time	3158	B
i- i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or	3158	B
just not sitting down at all	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
well and i'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary and so i find myself putting glasses on to	3158	B
to watch TV and then taking them_1 off to do needlework and i get frustrated doing that so just give it up	3158	B
ooh that does-	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
uh-huh	3158	B
yeah i'm the same way if i see something i can copy it but i certainly can't create i admire people that have that in their minds already	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
well sometimes even with that yeah- i- i think you have to have some	3158	B
um well i guess first of all i i could have asked that before do you have children	3133	A
no okay because_1 i i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt um what- what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
i just um	3133	A
i guess that's my	3133	A
that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and um	3133	A
i had opportunities in high school	3133	A
to work in some programs um	3133	A
and and i agree with what you said that it's	3133	A
uh it benefits the person doing it so much i don't think they realize and i uh	3133	A
i i think it gives you a better perspective on life and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world and and it would certainly help the country too uh	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
yes	3133	A
yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um	3133	A
my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful and then i wondered if people were unwilling but	3133	A
but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long um	3133	A
but i do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um	3133	A
they do still have opportunities	3133	A
but i i think that's a small uh	3133	A
number	3133	A
that could	3133	A
no um not since um	3133	A
not as much as i remember growing up and that was something	3133	A
uh	3133	A
i think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades	3133	A
but	3133	A
yes	3133	A
yeah where uh where abouts do you live what part of the country	3133	A
oh okay we're in Plano so we're not far apart one of the calls i'd gotten before was uh down to Austin and and i know	3133	A
a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area	3133	A
oh	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
well and maybe um maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if we've lost some of that and it it seems in the last decade or two um	3133	A
that's true maybe that's a way	3133	A
if if young people had to do it um	3133	A
maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things i always	3133	A
thought was a wonderful part of our country um	3133	A
is helping others	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
yeah i think uh	3133	A
i think it does help um even preschoolers you know they're um things even just starting around the home you know little ones can do a little bit to help the family	3133	A
and and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern there's always something no matter how young and then that helps	3133	A
develop that attitude um i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more you know i think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it but	3133	A
i wish ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um	3133	A
sometimes what Richardson and Plano both i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is i mean that's uh	3133	A
gosh i'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas and uh	3133	A
it's i know our church youth group um starts with projects young but they- they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year they've done this for fourteen years now	3133	A
um and it is it's um	3133	A
and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there and um	3133	A
it really every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective and	3133	A
and that's just the two- two weeks during during the summer so if two weeks um could have that kind of effect i would	3133	A
think uh	3133	A
well that's	3133	A
yes	3133	A
well i guess um	3133	A
did you have anything else that	3133	A
okay well i i enjoyed talking with you	3133	A
and i hope you have a good evening thanks bye bye	3133	A
okay	3133	B
no	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
i think it's a good idea i think everybody should should uh	3133	B
put in their time so to speak for the	3133	B
for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves i think it's uh would help everyone- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about	3133	B
did you oh	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
really	3133	B
yeah i think that's probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know they just they were they did things for people	3133	B
you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
yeah that's probably true	3133	B
you know but even- even through those groups- groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
yeah i think that's probably true	3133	B
i think it's probably more true still- still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities	3133	B
well i live in Richardson right now which is just	3133	B
right yeah okay sure	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
gosh i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're right	3133	B
yeah but i grew up in a real small town in Florida	3133	B
i mean a real small town	3133	B
and uh i think it was just	3133	B
of course it was back in the in the fifties and i think it was real prevalent back then i i think people thought more of others than they do now you know	3133	B
as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
yeah i do to i do to	3133	B
i'm not sure that that today's kids would go for it though i think you would have to start younger	3133	B
you know i i don't know how young you'd have to go but i think by the time they're oh early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now at least around here um	3133	B
right	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
uh yeah i would have to start in the families first because_1 if you don't it for your for your own immediate family your sure not going to do it for anybody else	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
that's probably true that's probably true	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
oh that's great	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
well that's that's great i'm glad that there are still some areas that	3133	B
that- that get the youth involved in that sort of thing you know like i said i think it does	3133	B
even- even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes	3133	B
well	3133	B
no i i guess that's about all okay	3133	B
well good talking with you	3133	B
you too okay bye	3133	B
they suggested some sort of a recipe uh for um company for entertaining did you have anything in mind that uh you'd like to share	3167	A
ooh	3167	A
uh-huh	3167	A
ooh that sounds good what	3167	A
um-hum	3167	A
i see	3167	A
one tablespoon of Worcester	3167	A
okay	3167	A
oh that	3167	A
how much chili sauce did you say	3167	A
like eight not eight ounces that would be a lot	3167	A
is it okay this would make a lot right	3167	A
and how much crab meat did you use	3167	A
one	3167	A
one can of flake oh okay have you ever used the uh imitation yet	3167	A
ooh that sounds i've tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation and then i found out i went back to the store and they said it is a fish product	3167	A
so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is you know	3167	A
oh that's a good idea whose was that	3167	A
uh	3167	A
uh Sam's right right	3167	A
oh oh that sounds good because that's great that must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant	3167	A
okay i i've	3167	A
right oh hey that sound	3167	A
right and it's something good to have on hand too it's frozen in the first place right so you can uh it is frozen isn't it	3167	A
and then you can refreeze	3167	A
hey that sounds great that sounds-	3167	A
oh do you and that's my favorite and i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it	3167	A
that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve i- i said i can make it in no time it's trying to think	3167	A
and then we just uh built a new home and i have one of these kitchens that the center of the house and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking which is funny	3167	A
but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months we've lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven	3167	A
with all the everything through ready to serve because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine	3167	A
you're right and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come in you know they'll come in the kitchen and i said	3167	A
out we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for for guests you're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen	3167	A
and it- it it has worked out but at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation	3167	A
oh we even have a better one now we decided that we all meet we have it worked- worked	3167	A
well i uh just had a Christmas Around the World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres and	3167	B
and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy it's uh	3167	B
it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon Worcester sauce	3167	B
and mix it and spread it out onto a plate and	3167	B
uh-huh	3167	B
and then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat	3167	B
mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuit crackers	3167	B
and that always goes over real well and it's real easy	3167	B
it's one of the small bottles	3167	B
i don't think uh it-	3167	B
well it's about eight ounces it it uh-huh	3167	B
yeah it would probably make well it- it doesn't make quite as much as you think but yeah spread out because you you keep the cream cheese kind of thin	3167	B
one tin of the flake uh-huh and drain it real good	3167	B
um-hum	3167	B
yes i have i used it uh last Christmas time uh what did i put it in	3167	B
i think i just served it by itself there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff	3167	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3167	B
right right	3167	B
that's very true very true i had bought a cheesecake uh and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be refrozen which i felt was real nice	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
it uh was uh Lawry's i believe or Lawler's and i got it do you have a Sam's wholesale warehouse up there it's real	3167	B
yeah okay that's where i picked it up and it comes out of Chicago and they're very good cheesecakes	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
yes yes and they have and they have the little papers between them_1	3167	B
and i think they're what about nine dollars and something	3167	B
yes yes yes	3167	B
yes it is frozen and i thaw it and then you -can refreeze it and uh-huh it was they're very good very good and that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts	3167	B
is it	3167	B
uh-huh it is	3167	B
uh-huh	3167	B
that's right and your mess	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
yeah- right right	3167	B
that's that's right	3167	B
correct	3167	B
sounds	3167	B
right	3167	B
well a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that we've known a long time like you they uh we all bring things and it sure makes it a whole lot easier anymore	3167	B
well basically uh did you wanna go first then	3184	A
okay right	3184	A
um-hum	3184	A
sure uh-huh	3184	A
yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a small residential area and we're out of the	3184	A
cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and uh it's just a typical um	3184	A
three bedroom type of home it's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know it's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home and um	3184	A
and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um	3184	A
there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's	3184	A
where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of um home so	3184	A
uh	3184	A
uh-huh oh really hm	3184	A
sure	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
yeah	3184	A
oh yeah yeah	3184	A
yeah	3184	A
um-hum so it's a rambler style	3184	A
um-hum	3184	A
yeah yeah it's kind of like what ours is uh our one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because_1 they are making	3184	A
anyway but okay_1 that sounds great and uh i don't know if we need to talk anymore or whatever	3184	A
the TI um yes uh about three times and- so i'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay	3184	A
no huh-uh no i'm out of state i'm in Wisconsin so yeah yeah so its	3184	A
um other than that sure yeah is this your first time	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
i'm the always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because_1 it's like i can get it done with i don't have to wait until somebody called me even though i have a feeling what's gonna happen is i'll probably get tons of calls you know so	3184	A
sooner or later	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
yeah yeah yeah sure	3184	A
yes okay well you take it easy Gail um-hum bye now	3184	A
uh well i can i i don't own my home um	3184	B
so i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we aren't sure we're gonna buy a house yet because we don't know if we're gonna be staying here	3184	B
in uh Texas so	3184	B
um-hum	3184	B
um-hum	3184	B
yeah well our home- our house we we're renting it from an individual who bought it and he lives in Korea and- and uh he's recently moved here and he's owns eight or nine properties	3184	B
uh near here and uh so but the houses around here there's five five houses on my street for sale right now	3184	B
which is just uh incredible- -incredible to me and they're not very expensive either it just seems like we we have a three bedroom house ours is one level only um but we	3184	B
yeah we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen and the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger so	3184	B
yeah	3184	B
have you done- have you done this before	3184	B
uh-huh	3184	B
oh have you	3184	B
yeah are you in Texas no yeah	3184	B
oh really oh	3184	B
sounds interesting	3184	B
no huh-uh i've oh i've gotten several calls um but uh	3184	B
yeah	3184	B
yeah yeah well they've i've talked to some people from Cleveland and i did talk to someone else who lives here uh in the same city i do so that was kind of interesting	3184	B
they're they're sure getting their people out so well it was nice to talk to you anyway and okay thanks bye-bye	3184	B
now then i think that are you there all right do you have any one that has been in a nursing home	3191	A
oh	3191	A
yes	3191	A
well what do you think can be done about that i mean what can we do	3191	A
well i can remember of course i'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this	3191	A
we did not have to call on on someone else and i feel	3191	A
yeah	3191	A
certainly did- i worked with an agency in West Texas that	3191	A
they it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels	3191	A
and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen	3191	A
my mother expired just just a little over a year ago and we had finally she didn't wanna live with either my sister or me	3191	A
but we be got found a retirement center for her and it was beautiful and they had all these they didn't even have nursing care there	3191	A
so until as long as mother was you know mobile and got her food- and she was with people with whom she enjoyed	3191	A
sure	3191	A
yes sir	3191	A
yeah	3191	A
being a widow i find that eating alone is one of the hardest things i have to do	3191	A
i have just recently retired and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to	3191	A
so uh mother had the little kitchenette and she could do all these fine things that she just	3191	A
had- had a microwave had to pop her popcorn now this is wonderful but when it came time for a full meal	3191	A
then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy it	3191	A
oh i think so too-	3191	A
well	3191	A
uh-huh yeah i'm here	3191	B
uh well uh we may um my grandmother before very short time um	3191	B
she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip	3191	B
because she could receive more medical attention but um that physical therapy was there and whatever but i think in visiting her there	3191	B
um it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in uh weren't there mentally uh she was probably the only person in the um	3191	B
whole nursing home that uh still had all of her mental facilities about her so that was uh that was very disheartening	3191	B
oh yeah it's really hard i guess i- i come from a family of um	3191	B
of uh take care of your elders i I guess um my my dad's mother is an invalid and she lives with my aunt and uncle and they care for her you know all around the clock though she's not	3191	B
uh she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed	3191	B
so i guess you know there's that family commitment um i know that my parents my mother's trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can	3191	B
um	3191	B
yeah	3191	B
right yeah	3191	B
yeah well probably i think as long as the person's able to um to understand what's going on around them and i think	3191	B
you know my grandmother right now still able to walk around and she's still able to um	3191	B
to do some things for herself though she gets Meals On Wheels which i think is a great thing because um	3191	B
it saves people from having to prepare her food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever though she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her	3191	B
hum-um	3191	B
uh-huh	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
um-hum right	3191	B
yeah that i think you know it's really funny i have two grandmothers still alive and my	3191	B
my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible she's like openly told people she's always been very good about knowing yes she's eighty nine and she said that she really would like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home	3191	B
but when the time comes um	3191	B
she and she can't do things and she has to be cared for or whatever she would prefer and she's actually said this to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment	3191	B
uh probably with like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette	3191	B
so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway	3191	B
uh to a room where there's a cafeteria and there's other people there and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
yes	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
yeah i think i think that probably until invalids- until they're really invalids elderly- the elderly are invalids	3191	B
i think that they should be able to interact with other people in- in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it i think um and see i know that	3191	B
my grandmother would like to stay in her house and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma actually says who she wants to live with she's pretty you know she lets people know	3191	B
so-	3191	B
hello my name is Nola i'm in Plano Texas	3140	B
not too far away	3140	B
i've had some from Plano too	3140	B
uh-huh	3140	B
okay um let's see	3140	B
social changes	3140	B
uh sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties i guess	3140	B
think we can handle that	3140	B
okay uh shall i go ahead and push one	3140	B
okay	3140	B
you want to go ahead and start	3140	B
that involves a lot of different areas i think	3140	B
yeah there is a a big difference in the uh economic	3140	B
um status of uh people although i think that has been true uh always um	3140	B
perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was	3140	B
um	3140	B
i think uh	3140	B
my- in my situation i have three children and we're uh home schooling so education you know things that relate to- to education um	3140	B
are things that i think about a lot um i think that and i think that involves	3140	B
social changes a lot	3140	B
uh for instance	3140	B
i think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that	3140	B
are happening socially in the world around them and in in to- because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather	3140	B
more not than are and children being put in day care centers from very early and and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the	3140	B
day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes	3140	B
because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn and they're not um	3140	B
they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have and they don't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and	3140	B
deal with the things in the world	3140	B
and uh i think we're seeing a lot of	3140	B
rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang	3140	B
gang things that are happening and and um	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
yeah oh	3140	B
that's really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and i i think that if they didn't that	3140	B
and- and it became more of the standard not to	3140	B
that uh i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
that's right	3140	B
it's already	3140	B
it already costs society much more because of it you know it trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know	3140	B
um there's and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of two parent	3140	B
um	3140	B
situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know	3140	B
rather than that she has to have the money particularly or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too	3140	B
you know	3140	B
home school	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
no we're i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way	3140	B
yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think	3140	B
home schooling's always been around but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems	3140	B
a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it it's really obvious	3140	B
to look at them and watch the way they act and things that um	3140	B
they've been raised in a day care center	3140	B
well i think it's going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base	3140	B
it's the basic unit	3140	B
and that's the where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better	3140	B
and educating uh you know	3140	B
i know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what	3140	B
family life is like and the uh you know	3140	B
and uh that kind of thing but um	3140	B
hello	3140	A
hi Nola i'm Steve i'm in Dallas Texas	3140	A
no that's unusual seems like usually	3140	A
oh yeah i think all mine have been East Coast people so far	3140	A
so	3140	A
social changes	3140	A
what's that mean	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah i yeah i definitely i mean there's plenty of things to talk about there that's a	3140	A
yeah sure	3140	A
uh i was hoping that you would but oh	3140	A
yeah social changes is that uh	3140	A
it seems to me that uh	3140	A
does uh	3140	A
yeah like a lot it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today	3140	A
so	3140	A
that-	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
it's like people are starting to give up hope and they start out	3140	A
very poor let's see that's a bad tangent to get on what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties	3140	A
and the nineties no	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah it seems so that yeah that is a pretty big change it seems	3140	A
even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like	3140	A
some of these even ladies that that'll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work you know well that that i mean that's very young for a baby	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah i mean they're going to like you said i mean there-	3140	A
there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah- yeah	3140	A
oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment	3140	A
huh is yeah is the thing how uh home study is that what you said home school is that uh is is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or	3140	A
oh is	3140	A
oh well you sound busy	3140	A
so you're teaching them completely huh	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
that's pretty sad because	3140	A
i mean	3140	A
i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
changing people's expectations	3140	A
well not so much personally but my um husband has a aunt who has been like a second mother i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such	3131	A
they live down in College Station where his parents do too and they put her in a home last year she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own	3131	A
so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year	3131	A
uh yeah although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point	3131	A
then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car	3131	A
uh	3131	A
well yeah when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the i mean it wasn't a very um strong stroke it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't quite herself anymore	3131	A
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself and she didn't eat she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it	3131	A
and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so	3131	A
um	3131	A
well she was almost ridiculous like she'd eat ice cream and cookies	3131	A
she'd	3131	A
didn't one	3131	A
oh really well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore oh that's too much trouble that's too much trouble didn't want to cook	3131	A
yeah	3131	A
although they've got uh Meals On Wheels which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat	3131	A
no i don't think there was um i know a little bit more from a a coworker her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in	3131	A
um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but	3131	A
i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House i think out in Arlington something like that	3131	A
and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items	3131	A
they	3131	A
they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half senile-	3131	A
hum	3131	A
so they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items very limited space waste but um at least they all seem to have some	3131	A
you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean	3131	A
very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but	3131	A
yeah i don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else	3131	A
uh-huh	3131	A
uh-huh	3131	A
yeah i have a um my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently and uh she lives in Pennsylvania they live in Alabama and they're saying hey we need you to be closer and	3131	A
you have uh women like that i don't know to men it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that whole i mean they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it	3131	A
um	3131	A
um	3131	A
but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that because i think- i think what do you have there it's a house it's walls and it's furniture but	3131	A
there's nobody there don't you want to be close to me	3131	A
i mean you know be with other people i just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house	3131	A
yeah	3131	A
that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family what does that house got attraction i never really thought of independence	3131	A
uh	3131	A
well when she got home who took care of her	3131	A
ah	3131	A
um-hum	3131	A
um	3131	A
yeah my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and	3131	A
there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here	3131	A
we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
so it was pretty much a physical decision	3131	B
um	3131	B
yeah my husband's family are reaching that point but it's it's so difficult was she in favor of it or or was she	3131	B
kind of opposed to it	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
so often i think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad i work with a lot of elderly people i'm a trust officer	3131	B
and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals	3131	B
yes well you know that's part of the aging process that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste it really is yeah uh-huh	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
and the portions people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals i do that right now and i'm not near nursing home age	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
so as a family you all just	3131	B
visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
oh yeah that's a given	3131	B
um-hum and sometimes the the help there does it i think	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
adapt yeah	3131	B
i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but	3131	B
the the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better	3131	B
as far as elderly people adapting they're able to move in while they're still independent and still social and and they do group things	3131	B
and then as health or or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and	3131	B
oh i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in it's really kind of difficult	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
well and it's the first step in in actually accepting that you are failing and and aging	3131	B
you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change	3131	B
they they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision	3131	B
and that scares me the the thought of forcing somebody to do something	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
not as independence	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3131	B
yeah and the quality of life really isn't there	3131	B
oh it's tough it really is	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
well they fear being dependent on somebody they they fear being a burden to to family members	3131	B
my husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation	3131	B
she'll let something slip and we'll say wait a minute and and that's it she just well i didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers	3131	B
yeah well she stayed she stayed in a temporary nursing home until she was okay	3131	B
you know it's just but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her she's down in Temple and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on	3131	B
so it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
well course my favorite team there is the Texas Rangers so i watch them all the time	3160	A
and who do you watch	3160	A
the Mets	3160	A
this isn't their best season is it	3160	A
well the Rangers are the few games behind Minnesota but if we could win the next oh i guess we'd win have to win most all of them we could still go to the to the race to do the	3160	A
well i watched the two games the last two nights so	3160	A
oh is that right	3160	A
pardon	3160	A
i think they're out six	3160	A
and so they have to still win almost every single game that they have to play to the end now	3160	A
or else	3160	A
yeah yeah	3160	A
i don't know Minnesota's won a good game they're they're doing a good job this year i don't know	3160	A
they really but i'm gonna watch tonight because Nolan Ryan's gonna pitch so i always like to watch him pitch	3160	A
yeah	3160	A
um-hum	3160	A
well uh we just traded Buechele and i really liked him but but- he's gone now so i i guess uh Sierra i like to watch him bat	3160	A
yeah he's he's really good Franco's good except that uh he's got injuries right now his hamstring's down in the bottom of his legs he can't run very well but	3160	A
yeah well they've moved him now since he can't move that quickly since it hurts him	3160	A
they moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into that area in that runs now in between the shortstop area and he takes second base	3160	A
um Sierra let's see yeah Sierra's into	3160	A
is he middle field or left field he's not left field he must be center field	3160	A
do you	3160	A
oh now what's that i don't know what that is	3160	A
oh	3160	A
oh	3160	A
oh	3160	A
yeah that's hard	3160	A
um no not too not too much i- i guess i just don't watch them that much um	3160	A
i like to watch the Oakland A's play they have a lot of good players too but i haven't watched them for a while so i don't know how they're doing too well this season	3160	A
um once every so often mostly Rangers games come on because that's our area but um	3160	A
every once in a while on a Saturday or a Sunday they'll put a another league on you know	3160	A
but it's it just depends	3160	A
how to you know how they fill the time sometimes	3160	A
anyway i um we got	3160	A
what	3160	A
oh is it	3160	A
oh well that's kind of fun	3160	A
yeah uh isn't it's a fun thing i think you'll like it it's a it's a old thing to do and um	3160	A
anyway we just uh if you get run out of things to say then you say good bye it was nice talking to you too	3160	A
and have a good day um bye-bye	3160	A
uh the Mets but i don't do that anymore because uh they're doing lousy i don't know	3160	B
no no	3160	B
i think you're uh definitely an avid fan huh	3160	B
they just i gave up on the Mets around August you know	3160	B
how many games out is Texas	3160	B
how many games out are they	3160	B
right right yeah i think Minnesota's got to get like three wins or or Texas has to lose three games or some combination of that well maybe next year	3160	B
yeah they- they are they are	3160	B
yeah who's who's who he used to be on the Mets a long time ago but who's who's who else is like Texas's big players that that uh	3160	B
right Ruben- right he's supposed to be good	3160	B
he's the shortstop though right Franco	3160	B
right	3160	B
and Sierra's an outfielder	3160	B
yeah i don't see i don't know the American League that well once in a while i watch the Yankees um but rarely and uh but this guy that i'm i work with is in this rotisserie league where they they choose	3160	B
well you choose players and you do stuff based on stats and everything like that so he's always talking to me about the American League	3160	B
like he gets points for every time uh i think he has Ruben Sierra on his team and every time he hits a home run or steals a base or gets a hit he gets a certain amount of points and then you get pitchers and stuff like that	3160	B
so he's always talking about the American League which is like i said because i watch the Mets i don't really know that much about the American League	3160	B
you're not an Astro fan	3160	B
no they're not they they were doing well for a while but then they kind of fell off do you get all the games out there i mean you get you get to watch the A's a lot and stuff like that	3160	B
right	3160	B
right	3160	B
this is my first conversation through this Texas Instruments thing	3160	B
this is the first time i've done one of these conversations yeah	3160	B
so i didn't even expect it i just i happened to have the uh i didn't even know what my um my personal identification number was i just happened to have the folder right in front of me i'm glad i brought it into work just	3160	B
okay well it's nice talking to you and uh be good thank you	3160	B
okay bye-bye	3160	B
do you have any personal feelings on on uh the subject	3105	A
um-hum um-hum	3105	A
so outrageous i know i know	3105	A
right	3105	A
well i i guess my concern is what we're reading especially in Texas right now with them letting out	3105	A
the people out of jail as soon as they're out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out they're back in crime and- and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriffs	3105	A
deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem with that	3105	A
i think so	3105	A
right	3105	A
right	3105	A
well	3105	A
doesn't have the right	3105	A
right	3105	A
right right and meanwhile the witnesses move and die and and- and- and and they and there's no one to face them_1	3105	A
right right well they can't get any if the judge is going to have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it	3105	A
it's it's really bad it uh i	3105	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3105	A
a a time limit too don't let it drag on for fifteen years	3105	A
right	3105	A
right	3105	A
uh do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the result this should be consequences of is capital punishment or or are are there some murders that committed that you think that- leniency should be shown	3105	A
um-hum um-hum	3105	A
okay	3105	A
right	3105	A
um-hum	3105	A
hm and and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are because they have had them they have had them killed when they've	3105	A
um um um	3105	A
oh	3105	A
that was their goal oh	3105	A
that would be premeditated	3105	A
uh	3105	A
they killed him	3105	A
um um um	3105	A
um-hum	3105	A
uh-huh	3105	A
no well that's right there's no reason for murder no- i don't care if you're poor or if you're rich or if you're ugly or if you're prejudice- or uh what there that that's just beyond the	3105	A
i think this giving excuses is pretty prevalent uh uh you- i work in the school district and the all these kids they've they've got an excuse for everything and i can see it continuing on when they're adults	3105	A
i just	3105	A
it's just a a a bad habit uh uh kids have got to learn from the time they're real little there's no excuse for for being bad or making bad choices deliberately or anything it's	3105	A
it's it's uh i- i i sometimes think if if i were on a jury and and had to make the decision could i and i like to think i could if like you if if especially- especially- especially violent	3105	A
crime where it's a serial type killer or where maybe a a child- a child has been deliberately killed or	3105	A
right	3105	A
uh-huh	3105	A
well uh capital punishment's a hard thing but uh there've been several	3105	B
there've been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to	3105	B
to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people	3105	B
there have been some things you know i mean there's things done that are just	3105	B
yeah that i i don't know how	3105	B
i don't really think there's any other way to deal with it	3105	B
yeah i think that that that that's a really	3105	B
yeah if it's a it's a it presents a clear and present danger i mean it	3105	B
but it's something that's really hard to deal with the way that our justice system is right now	3105	B
is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal they're the ones with the rights	3105	B
they have the right to uh you know i think i watched something last week um	3105	B
that evict uh i'm sorry the accused has the right to a speedy trial	3105	B
but the victim does not have the right doesn't have the same	3105	B
doesn't have the same the same uh emphasis on those things as far as they're concerned so now the accused can can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them_1 you know	3105	B
exactly- uh-huh uh-huh exactly a continuance- continuance	3105	B
they can get continuances on for years before a a thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more	3105	B
the	3105	B
yeah that too	3105	B
um	3105	B
i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone	3105	B
has gone through	3105	B
you know a trial- a trial i don't know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there	3105	B
there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been	3105	B
has- uh yeah when someone has- well even when someone has been convicted	3105	B
and i mean	3105	B
it's just so	3105	B
so abundantly clear that they did it	3105	B
that appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times	3105	B
to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that it's such a waste of time and energy and money	3105	B
and it just that's what keeps that's what's keeping all the the you know the the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this	3105	B
oh	3105	B
well i guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that um	3105	B
you know like i could- i could see	3105	B
uh a first time offender being you know maybe in in a in a robbery situation trying to hold up a a store and getting scared and you know firing a gun and accidently	3105	B
killing someone okay i could see that that might be a situation where uh the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and i'm talking about uh	3105	B
cutting people up	3105	B
you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever	3105	B
that those kinds of things and any any kind of violent assault rape included	3105	B
needs to be addressed in in in that context	3105	B
well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty	3105	B
and the thing that was the worst about it is that these	3105	B
that uh two of these individuals were uh well all of the individuals involved were very young	3105	B
one was technically a minor and so he was sent back to Mexico he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here and they had told their teachers that	3105	B
that i mean repeatedly uh during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to to graduate from high school and kill cops	3105	B
that was what they had told their teachers and so that's what they did and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely	3105	B
he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they	3105	B
uh	3105	B
several several things happened that night but they they beat him up and took his gun and shot him	3105	B
with it and it was	3105	B
it was really terrible i mean	3105	B
uh i'd seen him like three or four days before that	3105	B
we'd we've gone out uh	3105	B
with with he and his wife and that was really really disturbing	3105	B
you know that that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobody's that disadvantaged	3105	B
and there's just no reason- i mean	3105	B
no	3105	B
yeah i think so too and that's uh	3105	B
so i i do- i do feel strongly about	3105	B
yeah	3105	B
yeah	3105	B
um-hum	3105	B
the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decisions and still the people nothing ever happens to them	3105	B
you know they stay in jail they get off time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again	3105	B
well and	3147	B
kids in college and how to help them_1	3147	B
yes	3147	B
and you've been through three of those	3147	B
yeah well i've been through once so	3147	B
how did you do it with your three	3147	B
where were you living back then	3147	B
okay	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
yeah i i think there's a lot of that when you go to a school with two thousand kids there	3147	B
suddenly a college that's small seems i'm going backwards	3147	B
so	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
well i think it was	3147	B
well a little bit of	3147	B
she narrowed it pretty rapidly to eliminate the real big ones Texas and A&M	3147	B
and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh	3147	B
the uh quality of the program it it you know Baylor was kind of always at the lead there for uh for some time	3147	B
uh she looked at Austin College	3147	B
i think she applied at Trinity but she really wasn't applying at any of the state schools	3147	B
um accounting	3147	B
so it was a bit of of the major but not a whole lot there's a lot of campuses have business majors so that was not a big deal for her	3147	B
but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of we visited there and she visited some because her high school boyfriend's sister was there so she had spent some time there and	3147	B
felt pretty comfortable she she looked at Austin College but i think again it was the the size aspect it was just too small for somebody	3147	B
coming from Plano unless you you really felt you needed something smaller	3147	B
so its	3147	B
uh about uh eleven thousand	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
so it's uh it's sizeable but it's	3147	B
it's sort of in the not giant size	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
yeah in the case of your kids that i i guess with Jennifer it was more	3147	B
uh that	3147	B
she was making her own choice which i kind of feel is one of the keys if they're going to go do it they better they better decide where with uh	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
definitely	3147	B
yeah well it seems uh i don't know of a whole bunch of kids who uh really do what their father did there's some i think doctors may be a place where and i don't know quite why	3147	B
that sons often follow Dad	3147	B
into the profession and maybe that's some of it takes Dad's pull to get an in and other folks can't get in as easily	3147	B
but uh i don't have any kids who want to become engineers	3147	B
uh	3147	B
so uh	3147	B
you just kind of live with it	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
yeah well that's the key to it is that enjoying what you're doing and uh you know i think the folks i see having more trouble picking colleges are	3147	B
i got some friends who at Arco there who uh well they're from back east and uh	3147	B
and uh their kids are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools	3147	B
when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you	3147	B
start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want	3147	B
uh-huh	3147	B
but they're from back east and they got a lot of relatives there so it's uh	3147	B
some of them do that	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
yeah	3147	B
well	3147	A
let's see we're going to talk about uh	3147	A
kids	3147	A
how to pick one right	3147	A
well it	3147	A
uh three times yeah	3147	A
well if	3147	A
well with uh John the first one he wanted to go into engineering so	3147	A
uh	3147	A
he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at good engineering schools in relatively small towns like Purdue	3147	A
in uh Lafayette Indiana we looked at uh	3147	A
Clemson and VPI	3147	A
we were living in in north Alabama at the time	3147	A
and uh we looked at Mississippi State which was in a small town in Mississippi and uh finally settled on Auburn which was in Alabama in the small town of Auburn	3147	A
and uh	3147	A
we also wanted a school that had a uh coop program	3147	A
because uh he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time	3147	A
so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him for Brian	3147	A
it that was kind of funny because he first started out thinking uh	3147	A
that he wanted to go to a small school that's what he thought when we lived in Alabama and then he moved to Plano and went to Senior High	3147	A
he figured if i can go to Senior High i can go to school any place	3147	A
that's right	3147	A
yeah	3147	A
so he ended up	3147	A
uh i don't remember what his original major was because_1 he changed it about three times	3147	A
at A&M but he ended up going to A&M i think because of	3147	A
uh he just thoroughly enjoyed the uh the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip	3147	A
and uh he was sold on the place	3147	A
Jana i think wanted to to stick a little closer to home	3147	A
and really didn't have a major when she went in in fact	3147	A
i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as uh Brian and John's in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like Stephen F and	3147	A
North Texas and maybe UTA and uh	3147	A
she had some idea that she might want to uh	3147	A
do something with uh physical therapy and TWU was also up in uh in Denton so if she started at one she could move to the other and might not even have to move out of her apartment	3147	A
so it was kind of close to home and there were two schools in town that uh she could commute back and forth between the two	3147	A
how did uh	3147	A
your gal picked Baylor	3147	A
yeah	3147	A
oh what's her major	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
sure	3147	A
i see	3147	A
good one in Plano yeah	3147	A
yeah	3147	A
what is the population of Baylor i don't even know	3147	A
oh is it okay	3147	A
yeah yeah not like uh Austin and College Station	3147	A
yeah it needs to be a place they want to go	3147	A
uh if they're going to be successful if they think Mom and Dad picked it or they're going there because that's where Mom and Dad went and that's what they want them to do uh that's the wrong reason for picking a place	3147	A
that's kind of the way Brian picked his first major i think he	3147	A
without asking me he thought because i was in computer science that he should do the same thing and so he started out in that arena and didn't really care for it and finally asked if i would mind if he changed and i said	3147	A
not at all because you- you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your Dad does	3147	A
so uh	3147	A
he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
well that could be	3147	A
sure	3147	A
well and they they need to do something that they think they will enjoy	3147	A
and uh	3147	A
uh like i told Jana once she finally settled on a major she just did so much better in college than she did in high school once she found something to get excited about	3147	A
and uh whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is is immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it	3147	A
and uh so far i think she is	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
oh i know it	3147	A
that's right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an Eastern school	3147	A
uh-huh	3147	A
well they feel some uh some peer pressure from their peers the parents do sometimes	3147	A
yes yes	3164	B
i thought it was good as a matter of fact um i was the generation that i didn't think i'd like it	3164	B
because you know i had seen the original	3164	B
and i thought uh did you too	3164	B
well i just thought oh if i go and you know see this one i'm going to be disappointed but we thoroughly- my husband and i went and we thoroughly enjoyed it	3164	B
yes well did you know that the um	3164	B
what was it you know where they did the arrow through the	3164	B
air was supposed to be a promo	3164	B
and they had just done it to promote the movie for a TV ad and they thought it was so good that they included it in the movie itself	3164	B
yes	3164	B
yeah won several it was it was it was really good i'm impressed with Kevin Costner i really am	3164	B
yes oh he likes to show his rear he did that in um	3164	B
Dances with Wolves	3164	B
if he doesn't keep getting a tan he'll be in trouble	3164	B
no	3164	B
no those i saw Terminator one and my husband went on his own to see that one	3164	B
did it	3164	B
oh	3164	B
oh how neat	3164	B
oh how interesting	3164	B
where do you oh we can't talk about where you work	3164	B
uh	3164	B
i'm trying to think of what else i've seen	3164	B
no no no	3164	B
well see my problem is um i teach school and so those movies that by the time the kids finish telling me about them_1 i don't go see them yep	3164	B
uh i'm trying to think of what else i've seen um	3164	B
oh what was the one with the guy that had amnesia the lawyer	3164	B
um oh it was so good now it's my names escape me um	3164	B
oh gosh i might try to look through the paper and see	3164	B
oh let's see what we have	3164	B
it was about a doctor who had amnesia uh not doctor lawyer	3164	B
and he was a real {hustly} {bustly} kind of person	3164	B
and then he got amnesia and	3164	B
sort of slowed down and nobody was used to him he had servants at home and very very rich and	3164	B
when he went through his thing his whole personality changed	3164	B
and i'm trying to remember the title of it	3164	B
yes it was Regarding Henry	3164	B
okay yeah i thought- i'm pretty sure he was and he was like out for everybody's	3164	B
you know to get everybody and to swing deals and do things that were	3164	B
borderline he never did anything illegal but	3164	B
yes yes well he wouldn't defend a case because he knew they were lying	3164	B
and he was the one that set up the lie for them and	3164	B
i don't think so because_1 we you know doctors and amnesia case too and	3164	B
then i had seen something on television	3164	B
so i think amnesia was in this year	3164	B
what was that again	3164	B
yes	3164	B
yeah that was released- that was called The Doctor and that was released after Regarding Henry	3164	B
but i didn't go see that because i felt like i had enough of one theme	3164	B
i haven't seen any of the new ones though	3164	B
i don't know if we've gotten five minutes in i didn't look at my clock	3164	B
three let me check my thing bet she's gonna hate us when she has to transcribe all this	3164	B
okay let's see	3164	B
yeah well i'm looking at the paper and i don't see anything	3164	B
hm	3164	B
i don't i don't see it	3164	B
-okay did you see Robin Hood	3164	A
uh-huh what do you think about that	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
i haven't no huh-uh	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
good	3164	A
i just heard that the critics thought that that song at the end was kind of dumb	3164	A
um-hum that special effect	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
oh uh-huh	3164	A
um i think i heard it even won an award or something that scene	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
especially that one waterfall scene	3164	A
Dances with Wolves	3164	A
uh-huh i knew they were gonna show his butt in there somewhere	3164	A
and um	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
did you see um Terminator Two	3164	A
uh-huh that was pretty good	3164	A
hm	3164	A
um-hum i don't know if i saw the first one but the second one had real good special effects	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
uh matter of fact i'm working with somebody that helped work on that movie	3164	A
i teach and she's a art teacher and	3164	A
um she came from California	3164	A
and she helped with the special effects out there	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
personal stuff	3164	A
um did you see Problem Child 2 i'm seeing all these sequels	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
uh-huh because_1 they told you every last detail	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
uh i don't know	3164	A
a lawyer with amnesia who was in it	3164	A
okay that's a good idea i didn't have a paper	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
hm i have no idea	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
hum	3164	A
oh is that that Regarding Henry um-hum	3164	A
i didn't know he was a lawyer in the movie i didn't see it	3164	A
uh-huh huh	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
so did he change for the better after that or huh	3164	A
that's strange	3164	A
is that based on a true story do you know or	3164	A
hm	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
um um-hum	3164	A
is that what happened to that movie with William Hurt do you know	3164	A
that he's in now um is that his name or John Hurt	3164	A
isn't there some movie about a doctor that something happened to him is that the same one you're talking about did he get amnesia	3164	A
uh-huh did you see that	3164	A
hm	3164	A
already seen it	3164	A
um-hum	3164	A
uh trying to think what else	3164	A
uh-huh me neither	3164	A
long enough for the the thing	3164	A
oh is it five because_1 someone told me it was three	3164	A
uh-huh	3164	A
okay	3164	A
i'm still trying to think of something else i've seen but	3164	A
okay_1	3164	A
well Nancy uh as- as i was talking	3112	B
my brother uh his name is Ainsley and he was a conductor in New York City of a Goldman band and they did park concerts at the Lincoln Center	3112	B
uh during the summer season uh they were free concerts but he was with that group for like twenty one years and uh did both very traditional marches a lot of you know John Phillips Sousa and	3112	B
uh all of and Franco Goldman in fact the name of the uh the band was because	3112	B
one of the famous uh march composers of all time uh Richard Franco Goldman and his son Edwin actually i may may have those reversed father and son	3112	B
started the band like seventy years ago i think so it's the oldest organization really of it's type in the country	3112	B
and uh my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years	3112	B
so	3112	B
well i was able to uh to hear him about three years ago for the first time at a a concert there and uh it was quite enjoyable um	3112	B
in that uh he also had one of the composers- well actually there were two of the composers that he used were actually there at the performance also	3112	B
so i got to meet them and in particular i got to go to the rehearsal before hand	3112	B
and that was when i realized how good he really was was at a rehearsal as opposed to an actually performance of uh working with the musicians	3112	B
and- and one of his biggest struggles uh with the band was that this was all union musicians	3112	B
which didn't give him a lot of leeway once they were in the band	3112	B
uh he had a very difficult time replacing them no matter how they were performing at that particular season	3112	B
and uh he ended up with some very unusual characters in that that organization it was easy to tell that just from the rehearsal time	3112	B
but uh anyway what were you going to tell me about your dad	3112	B
oh	3112	B
uh-huh	3112	B
uh-huh	3112	B
oh yeah i- i was in the band in high school and that	3112	B
i played the clarinet	3112	B
and uh so i- i did that my all through high school and then i guess my first year in college i played but it wasn't a marching band it was just a it was a symphonic band	3112	B
and uh ironically in college the marching band was part of the athletic department rather than the music department	3112	B
oh	3112	B
right	3112	B
uh-huh	3112	B
a tuba- tuba	3112	B
right well does he bring the tuba home to-	3112	B
oh my goodness	3112	B
yeah just anything i have a niece that plays the harp	3112	B
and she found the same thing that uh she had i think what they call a troubadour harp for a while and that she learned on and trained on but then uh	3112	B
uh a harp became available which there just not very many instruments uh and a used harp became available in Colorado and they lived in in uh Missouri at the time	3112	B
and they actually drove to Colorado to buy this instrument but they first had to go and buy a full sized	3112	B
station wagon	3112	B
uh so they'd have room to bring it home	3112	B
and that's dictated their cars every since then just having one large enough for a full you know concert harp	3112	B
that she plays	3112	B
uh	3112	B
well i uh because of my brother's uh work with music for a long time he was a	3112	B
uh a critic for the Music Journal	3112	B
and as a result of that he	3112	B
well that was part of the reason he ended up with this incredible classical album uh library or collection which i have now inherited	3112	B
and um	3112	B
i- i don't listen to in nearly enough it's the same sort of thing there's so much music that i recognize but don't who is yeah who is the composer	3112	B
but i've	3112	B
based on just measuring number of inches or in this case feet of albums that i think i have about a a uh two thousand album classical record collection now	3112	B
so i figured that uh i could probably listen to a different album every day of the year for about seven years	3112	B
if i wanted to at this point	3112	B
but then it's hard to find a place to stack that much music	3112	B
most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room	3112	B
but uh	3112	B
anyway	3112	B
um	3112	B
well he really did uh i know that he was a critic probably in the early sixties in New York City he had um	3112	B
we were thirteen and a half years apart i think and he left home at like sixteen to go to Westminster Choir College	3112	B
and you know he did not finish high school he just went straight- straight to Westminster so i never really remember having lived at home with him	3112	B
and after he did get out of college it was not long he	3112	B
before he uh just moved to New York City knowing that that's where he had to live to quote unquote make it in the music world	3112	B
and um became a music critic and that probably puts us somewhere around the early sixties uh when he was doing that	3112	B
i've seen that date a good bit on the uh on some of the albums because_1 he would typically uh sign and date everything that	3112	B
my goodness	3112	B
you have one that's nineteen years older	3112	B
my goodness	3112	B
that is a wide spread	3112	B
well we were at the opposite ends there were two sisters in between	3112	B
but uh because he left home so early i think there was one summer i can remember him living at home and i was maybe six years old	3112	B
i mean other than that uh i don't even ever remember living in in the same house with him at all	3112	B
well it was it was thrilling	3112	B
um my mother was with me at the time and it was ironically it was the first time that we'd seen him conduct that particular group which he'd been with so long	3112	B
she had seen him fact she had seen him conduct in Carnegie Hall before	3112	B
um and i'm not sure it was probably the American Symphony Orchestra when Leopold Stokowlski was	3112	B
uh in New York City that was Stokowlski's orchestra and Ainsley was an associate conductor with him for quite a while and it at one point did in fact uh	3112	B
uh conduct there at Carnegie Hall so she got to see him there and i- i didn't	3112	B
oh	3112	A
oh that that must have been wonderful were you able to hear	3112	A
yeah sometimes	3112	A
oh	3112	A
oh	3112	A
well um actually that lead into a couple different things um my dad worked with unions um	3112	A
for placing so he could really relate to what you were saying but um	3112	A
my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um even as a child i got to go	3112	A
to a lot of different um	3112	A
kinds of musical events	3112	A
um i grew up in Detroit and so we had opportunities for a wide range of things um one of the	3112	A
regrets i have is that i grew up with a house filled with classical music and music that i really loved but i never took the time to	3112	A
find out um who the composers were or it it was just always there and there were certain things that um	3112	A
i liked so much but i still have trouble to this day sometimes i will recognize a passage but i'll have no idea what it's from or whose it is and um over the last few years	3112	A
and when my father lived with us um i made more of an effort to learn but um that's something that i	3112	A
regretted but um when you mentioned the band music my	3112	A
son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school but this was the first year	3112	A
with marching band and i really enjoy band music um it	3112	A
oh what instrument did you play	3112	A
oh i like that	3112	A
oh	3112	A
yeah	3112	A
what uh my husband Tim played a trombone in high school and he also played in a a band in college not marching band but	3112	A
symphonic and that was	3112	A
really the first time that i got to hear a lot of the um	3112	A
band music and some of the wonderful composers other than the traditional Sousa and things that everybody knows and	3112	A
so i've	3112	A
enjoyed this so much um with our son now doing that and he plays tuba so i don't don't get to see him when he's doing um	3112	A
yes uh	3112	A
we uh	3112	A
uh the tuba and the sousaphone don't fit in in every kind of uh car	3112	A
oh	3112	A
yes	3112	A
oh	3112	A
oh gosh	3112	A
God	3112	A
yes	3112	A
well he must have collected that over a period of years	3112	A
hum	3112	A
i was going to ask you and it seemed that there must have been a big gap um i also have a brother who's thirteen years older and one who's nineteen years older you- you don't run into that very often	3112	A
uh-huh	3112	A
yeah	3112	A
oh i'm glad you got to go and hear him in New York though that um that must have been	3112	A
very special	3112	A
oh	3112	A
yeah is that like Visa and and MasterCard	3170	B
do you have department store credit cards too or	3170	B
uh-huh	3170	B
appliances	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
right	3170	B
my my husband and i do basically the same thing but we we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise	3170	B
we still pay it off every month if it kills us but we do it mainly for you know the cash flow what is that	3170	B
oh float that's the word float and i often will keep track- track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already	3170	B
and sometimes just and keep a list and make sure i	3170	B
i don't go over a certain limit especially around birthdays you know	3170	B
oh	3170	B
if we go out to a restaurant oh just to float it or i don't know	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
yes my husband has a	3170	B
uh	3170	B
or anytime like a plane ticket or you know	3170	B
even if we have the i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it but	3170	B
the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that	3170	B
that thirty days or whatever	3170	B
we have a new one from AT&T and we have you know haven't used that one too much be interesting that's nice because you can use it for a calling card also	3170	B
it's a MasterCard too so it's kind of fun uh but you get a lot of junk mail about them_1	3170	B
yeah you're such a a wonderful person	3170	B
we'll give you five thousand dollars up front	3170	B
right do you have uh uh an annual fee on yours or do you get yours through a bank or	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
yeah i- i can't see paying an annual fee for it i mean i almost	3170	B
yeah	3170	B
good talking to you thanks bye-bye	3170	B
basically um my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases we really don't get into small little purchases if we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but	3170	A
other than that it's not something that we use a lot of um	3170	A
we may have only two or three versus um i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or uh up to a dozen credit cards but um ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh	3170	A
use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
uh yeah one Sears	3170	A
Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do um	3170	A
appliances and things like that and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that so	3170	A
but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate if you've got the cash to pay for something it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two three month period but	3170	A
if it's uh	3170	A
any large purchases um you've got to kind of think about um how much you're going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off so	3170	A
uh-huh	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
yeah yeah	3170	A
uh-huh sure sure	3170	A
uh-huh	3170	A
sure so you know	3170	A
sure	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
exactly exactly yeah-	3170	A
or if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it so yeah	3170	A
um-hum	3170	A
um-hum	3170	A
sure	3170	A
oh sure for the month or whatever	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
exactly	3170	A
so	3170	A
uh-huh yeah	3170	A
exactly sure	3170	A
sure yeah	3170	A
oh yeah and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh your credit is great so let's send you another credit card or it's preapproved for	3170	A
such such to entice you to get more credit cards	3170	A
yeah	3170	A
and so you know we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so	3170	A
uh ours is through a bank yeah we had it a long time ago through a banking system so yeah just a but	3170	A
oh you're already paying them uh if you're if you don't pay it off within that month interest anyway so yeah that's exactly it	3170	A
so okay	3170	A
okay all right thanks a lot by now	3170	A
okay did	3176	A
um all i the scale is from one to ten i think one being um no	3176	A
or i'm sorry is all- total control	3176	A
and then ten as being no control is that what it was	3176	A
okay_1 so that would be like less control	3176	A
i i'm confused but i don't really think it matters but okay more control okay_1 and why is that	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum i don't either	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
huh	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
gosh i've never done that	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum where it's a like cool down if they're just like in the bad uh-huh i agree um that's why i'm i guess i'm like five	3176	A
in the middle because	3176	A
because like if i like i say if someone tried to break into my house today i would wanna get a gun that day	3176	A
you know for- to help be protected tomorrow or whatever that night	3176	A
but i wouldn't want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says i'm gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so it's like a double-edged sword i guess	3176	A
so	3176	A
hm hm but i've never i don't know if i've ever shot a gun i don't	3176	A
oh you have to that's neat	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
huh	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
who but you wanted like slightly more rules like	3176	A
um like you're towards the conservative end	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum i was just wondering because_1 like since i've never shot one maybe it's different if you've actually shot one or like you said hunted or you know maybe if i you know had ever shot one	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
huh	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
hm what kind of hunting have you done	3176	A
hm	3176	A
hm um-hum	3176	A
hm because_1 like i have friends that hunt and um but they're like real careful they kill the animal with like one shot so they don't have like a injured animal running around and um-hum	3176	A
hm	3176	A
oh my God	3176	A
does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or some real super gun or	3176	A
hm	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
oh my gosh	3176	A
hm	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
oh my God	3176	A
did she die or	3176	A
hm	3176	A
um-hum	3176	A
um-hum um-hum	3176	A
hm	3176	A
gosh i'd uh wouldn't wanna live near a forest	3176	A
uh-huh really are you still in the service or	3176	A
uh-huh	3176	B
oh where would i be i would be somewhere around hm seven or eighth	3176	B
i think for control	3176	B
oh no um	3176	B
more on the uh higher end	3176	B
yeah	3176	B
oh well for one i think criminals um	3176	B
they uh i mean i'm all for people you know hunting and doing their thing although i don't hunt personally	3176	B
i don't uh i don't own any guns but um you know i mean i've i've shot gun plenty of guns uh target practice	3176	B
and um well i mean i've kind of gone out hunting a little bit you know with boyfriends but uh	3176	B
it's it's fun but you really have to have respect for the weapon	3176	B
and uh but the thing i'm concerned about is you know those people you know like a seven day delay is not gonna hurt those people it's no big thing um you know because it's it's	3176	B
you know recreation whereas the people who are going out to um you know for crime	3176	B
you know to rob somebody now i think that's good that they have enough time to check their record you know and it	3176	B
oh yeah it's for everybody's safety	3176	B
uh-huh yeah i mean i could be five too	3176	B
oh well i didn't think about that	3176	B
yeah	3176	B
um-hum	3176	B
yeah	3176	B
yeah it definitely is i didn't think about the other side huh	3176	B
hm well i served in the service so you have to	3176	B
you have to uh shoot a weapon and qualify otherwise you don't pass	3176	B
so to speak and uh so we had to zero it you know to your own eye each gun you have to kind of zero to your own eye and how you look at the sights	3176	B
and um	3176	B
oh well i'm kind of fifty fifty you know if- you know hearing your argument it got- i'm just right smack in the middle	3176	B
oh well you	3176	B
well you definitely need to you know have the uh respect for it and you can't just pick up a gun and expect to hit something you know you may be within let's say a foot- foot range	3176	B
i mean uh i don't know half a foot to a foot off	3176	B
um just because of your sights and how you look through a sight as compared to somebody else	3176	B
oh uh that was uh i- i think we just for small but it was quail i think	3176	B
i mean yeah that was just nothing not not anything like deer or rabbits or squirrels	3176	B
but uh	3176	B
um-hum	3176	B
oh well here uh actually about thirty minutes away there was a guy that fired and the bullet actually went through the deer and then hit somebody and killed them_1	3176	B
so it hit two different targets um and	3176	B
i don't know it's i'm surprised because usually when a bullet hits something it um	3176	B
it it compresses you know it loses it's shape	3176	B
but uh evidently they had bone fragments of both so um yeah it killed and and they've had several instance right here in Raleigh and it was national news	3176	B
and it was a real big thing but uh had several uh one woman was out in her backyard and she had a white glove on she was taking her laundry down and the guy thought it was the tail of the uh deer	3176	B
and shot her	3176	B
uh i think so yeah there was two or three killings like right one was a school teacher and of course all the school- kids uh were upset about it and it made the news so uh	3176	B
you know it's it hit pretty close to home i guess	3176	B
no and-	3176	B
okay	3149	A
all right well i guess you know i- i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem	3149	A
and if we you know and if it's not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're going to be	3149	A
well that's what i think and it's going to start affecting all of the population you know i mean right now yeah you know and it's just going to become such a huge issue	3149	A
and it's just so scary that there's just not much that can be done at this point so i guess	3149	A
yes	3149	A
yeah yeah	3149	A
right	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
well-	3149	A
well i think so too and so i guess i would you know personally i would be really in favor of that now i have had um i have two friends who've died of it	3149	A
and uh so and those have just you know it's just been real hard and i just hate seeing people you know go through this	3149	A
so and i keep thinking it's going to hit our church eventually you know it's like uh it's- it's real interesting to me that we've not had anybody yet but you know it's going to just start affecting i think everyone	3149	A
i know	3149	A
it is really scary you know i- i thought of that for myself for like for my children this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary	3149	A
because you know people don't know that's the thing there's a factor- there's a time factor in there	3149	A
i know	3149	A
i know	3149	A
well that's right and i think you know people give blood innocently enough assuming that they're okay i don't suppose anybody would give blood if they felt they i don't know i guess they might but	3149	A
uh you know i- i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing	3149	A
oh	3149	A
yeah really	3149	A
there yeah right well because yeah then what are they going to do	3149	A
um they have no other alternatives i suppose um	3149	A
well i i don't know i mean i just but then i think well uh yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because_1 that's going to sort of be the our only answer	3149	A
well and i worry you know the older my children get the more exposure- chances of exposure they're going to have i mean i can't imagine well even for you being a single person i mean i think gosh how scary you know to meet people and	3149	A
uh you- you know	3149	A
uh	3149	A
well you might you know eventually	3149	A
yeah that might eventually happen but uh	3149	A
i mean	3149	A
i mean really	3149	A
i know well it's just a it's just a sad thing and i don't know hopefully this is going to get taken care of at some point	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
oh this was your husband wasn't it that's right i've forgotten that you told me that but i'd forgotten	3149	A
uh-huh	3149	A
AZT	3149	A
hum	3149	A
well i know and and- you know and make it available to people that- that can use it i you know if i were sick i would try anything i think i mean what do you have to lose	3149	A
i mean that's what's that's what's so crazy i mean what's to lose at this point	3149	A
i would if it were me	3149	A
yeah i mean yeah you'd want you'd want everything available and then to think well it's available but you could- i mean you know you could only get it in Europe um	3149	A
would-	3149	A
would be a terrible	3149	A
that would be a terrible thing	3149	A
but um how long was he how long was Randy sick	3149	A
hum	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
hm	3149	A
so he was really susceptible	3149	A
that's awful	3149	A
huh	3149	A
um-hum	3149	A
um	3149	A
um	3149	A
well in some ways that's a blessing	3149	A
i mean it's such a	3149	A
awful thing to suffer through	3149	A
well my	3149	A
huh	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
yeah	3149	A
well i know it is well my two friends both one one lived a fairly long time with it i'd say Ken had it	3149	A
well he thinks he had he was HIV for ten years you know i mean he no he thinks he had it even back in the early eighties um	3149	A
and then he died in eighty nine	3149	A
so and then Terry-	3149	A
okay start us	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
right because it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse	3149	B
yeah-	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
it already has	3149	B
right although they are doing a whole lot more than they were five years ago you know they're living longer and and their medicines are a whole lot better so they're not having to go through as many of the as of the other diseases	3149	B
or so it sounds anyway as you know when when all of this first started out they they came down with every single disease that came down the pipe because they had no immune system and they suffered so much worse	3149	B
so you know at at least they're making progress but they've got to get it stopped they've got to find a cure	3149	B
so have i	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
well yeah	3149	B
well especially with you know surgeries all the time	3149	B
it's so scary	3149	B
uh-huh	3149	B
right	3149	B
right	3149	B
yeah and you know well with the time factor it could be up to ten years	3149	B
you know so that's what's so bad and and you may test negative this time but you may test positive you know two weeks down the road	3149	B
so	3149	B
the test is relevant for that very day but not necessarily forever	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
yeah and- and like when i went in the hospital you have to sign a paper saying that that you'll allow them to give blood if they if you need it otherwise they won't do the surgery	3149	B
so what do you do i mean yeah you're given the option of signing or not signing but if you say no i don't want the blood then they they may say well then i'm not going to do the surgery	3149	B
right right what- what can they do	3149	B
well yeah- that's right and they've got to do something about it they can't put it on the back burner	3149	B
and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because it's not there's no cure yet	3149	B
you got it	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
of course i don't have that problem	3149	B
slight chance you think	3149	B
uh that's	3149	B
oh it- it is it's like okay show me your papers	3149	B
then we'll talk	3149	B
yeah well they're doing a lot over in Europe	3149	B
with it	3149	B
and i know when Randy was so sick he was having medications flown in from Europe because_1 he couldn't get his hands on it over here and uh	3149	B
uh-huh	3149	B
yeah so he was he had a lot of medication coming in from Europe	3149	B
and then he finally was able to get the what is it AZT over here only because he had connections that was not open to the public at that time	3149	B
so	3149	B
i don't know but they've got to do it because it's it's everywhere	3149	B
to everybody	3149	B
yes-	3149	B
of course	3149	B
that's right	3149	B
there's nothing to lose so you may as well do whatever you got to do	3149	B
yeah or if it was one of my kids	3149	B
right no problem	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
little over two years	3149	B
little over two years and at that point he was the fifth fifth	3149	B
longest survivor	3149	B
but see that was almost four years ago	3149	B
and now they're living a whole lot longer	3149	B
so but he i mean jeez he had everything under the sun he had hepatitis he had meningitis he got throat cancer	3149	B
and he never smoked even a grapevine much less a cigarette you know um	3149	B
just you name it he he just oh it was horrible it was horrible	3149	B
yeah and then i had another very dear friend of mine die four months after Randy did	3149	B
and uh he didn't know he was sick he'd just you know had a cold that he couldn't shake all winter	3149	B
and kept getting sicker and sicker and finally went in the hospital and uh had pneumonia and both lungs were full and he died within about sixteen hours of going to the hospital	3149	B
yeah	3149	B
yeah yeah and his friend had died the year before	3149	B
and they swore it wasn't AIDS but i know darn good and well it was	3149	B
you know so	3149	B
ooh it's just that that's close to home	3149	B
you're kidding	3149	B
um my gosh	3149	B
uh-huh	3149	B
hello	3128	B
hi Leslie i'm Carol	3128	B
uh Plano Texas	3128	B
oh well we're right here in town then maybe we know each other	3128	B
uh oh	3128	B
Leslie who	3128	B
okay what choir are you from	3128	B
well of course i'm the little short one that sits on the end by Judy Dillon	3128	B
you're a soprano- well i well we can chitchat easily without any sweat then	3128	B
what a hoot i i'd forgotten about this thing i have been so bad oh good	3128	B
obviously it's working now i should-	3128	B
i will do better	3128	B
well okay Leslie- what are we gonna discuss Leslie	3128	B
fine	3128	B
well it i was hunting for all of my stuff and every time i pressed a button they were already talking by the time my phone clicked back in	3128	B
i have a cordless phone that doesn't do well	3128	B
great we can do that i don't care what you serve i'll let you go first you're in charge of the call you ready to press one	3128	B
go	3128	B
what kind of things would you put on it	3128	B
um-hum	3128	B
oh that seven layer dip	3128	B
okay	3128	B
okay you	3128	B
that's a wonderful recipe	3128	B
what would you use for your main course	3128	B
oh yeah	3128	B
that's an easy way to please everybody	3128	B
that way if there's something that they don't want then they can just simply leave it off on their own	3128	B
that's a good idea	3128	B
well i'm a very casual informal person so most of my quote dinner parties	3128	B
would probably be very laid back we'd probably do ribs or chicken or	3128	B
something like that on the grill put with corn on the cob and maybe a tossed salad fresh fruit that type of a thing	3128	B
i'm a i'm a lover of paper plates in the summer time and disposable plastic forks throw them away for an easy cleanup	3128	B
so i	3128	B
i'm afraid i'm not a real fancy sit down kind of use your best china	3128	B
dinner party kind	3128	B
well my life is kind of casual so my dinner parties would be also	3128	B
well what's a good potluck for eight to ten people what do you	3128	B
it can be anything	3128	B
it can be anything i i may just bring fresh fruit because i know everybody will eat that even though it's not	3128	B
you know someone'll bring a meat	3128	B
if not	3128	B
we go meatless i don't care yeah we don't we don't we eat too much too much meat at dinner parties anyhow	3128	B
i think they always go over well	3128	B
i think we've probably discussed all they need to discuss	3128	B
okay i've enjoyed talking to you and i if i have a Mexican dinner at anytime i'll do i think i'll run your yours by and have fajitas and bean dip and the whole nine yards	3128	B
okay i've enjoyed talking to you bye	3128	B
hello	3128	A
hi my name is Leslie	3128	A
hi Carol where you from	3128	A
oh you're kidding so am i	3128	A
yeah you're not from choir are you	3128	A
Leslie French	3128	A
uh Christ United Methodist	3128	A
oh okay i'm in the soprano parts	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
well i have too i have too and i	3128	A
oh i guess so i've only had uh one other chance at this thing and	3128	A
we're supposed to discuss food and cooking	3128	A
and uh did it describe it to you at all	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
okay well and it says uh which foods would you recommend for uh a menu for a dinner party	3128	A
and then maybe we can share a recipe with what they kind of what it kind of said	3128	A
uh yeah	3128	A
okay let	3128	A
i'm pressing one right now okay	3128	A
okay well i was thinking about if i did a dinner party right now i'd do a Mexican- Mexican fare of sorts because_1 that's about the only thing i'm creative at and uh	3128	A
well for appetizers i'd start with the you know the typical cheese nachos and uh melt the cheese over the chips and uh put some green pepper or i mean chili peppers on top of that for those who like it hot	3128	A
and then another good good um recipe for appetizers is uh bean dip i don't know if you've ever done that but you put just the uh refried beans and then a layer of uh	3128	A
of sour cream	3128	A
well it doesn't really have seven layers mine doesn't anyway and then i put like a layer of cheese and then some salsa on top of everything and then you just use it for dipping your chip into and	3128	A
yeah it's real good and then a	3128	A
probably go with fajitas	3128	A
uh season up some good chicken and beef and chop up a whole bunch of things so that they could kind of pick and choose what they like and	3128	A
yeah yeah	3128	A
that's right	3128	A
so i haven't done many dinner parties though lately i've just been uh	3128	A
um-hum	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
um-hum	3128	A
yeah	3128	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3128	A
oh	3128	A
yeah that's me too	3128	A
in fact we don't even have our dining table yet so i guess we've been pretty casual for most of everything so	3128	A
well speaking of dinner parties are we still doing this uh um	3128	A
yeah we	3128	A
you know what i was planning on doing i didn't know if it was needed but was a salad	3128	A
i mean that's i didn't know if it had to be a casserole of sorts	3128	A
okay	3128	A
okay	3128	A
yeah yeah	3128	A
that's right yeah it's kind a	3128	A
yeah yeah well that's that's my my love of if i'm not going to have a full meal is to make sure i get a good salad in there and a good you know thing of fruit and that that'll satisfy most anybody so	3128	A
yeah okay how long we supposed to talk on this about three minutes i hope	3128	A
yeah okay well then if we're done it's all we do is just say good-bye right well	3128	A
yeah i'll get	3128	A
yeah yeah sounds good nice talking to you bye-bye	3128	A
yes we're doing several different things um and i haven't kept up to date on what's happened lately but	3119	A
they have uh the igloos around and they have various places for different kinds of recycling	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
and uh uh i understand in the future we're supposed to uh	3119	A
begin a curbside pick up as well but that hasn't started yet	3119	A
how about you	3119	A
curbside would be wonderful i'm ready	3119	A
um they're also doing um a a recyclable bags to put the grass clippings in	3119	A
uh-huh so that they- you can't put them in plastic anymore	3119	A
and uh so that seems to be helping a little bit too	3119	A
oh	3119	A
that'd be great how- i am i'm not sure how a mulching mower works -does it just chop it up finely or what	3119	A
and you don't see the clippings lying around then huh	3119	A
well now do you recycle plastic also	3119	A
uh-huh	3119	A
i've heard that that's um something that can be started	3119	A
oh is that right	3119	A
right	3119	A
ooh that's a good idea	3119	A
oh that's great	3119	A
well no you've got to do that uh	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
oh how funny well old habits die hard don't they i mean it the whole issue of	3119	A
conservation and everything is i you know i i talk about it all the time with my kids i'm a teacher and i	3119	A
we talk about it a lot and yet um there are often times i find myself doing	3119	A
uh you- you know throwing- going ahead and throwing a way a plastic bottle instead of you know separating it and so forth i and i just forget	3119	A
so it's a it's a effort on everybody's part i think to begin to do this and keep it up	3119	A
yeah	3119	A
oh	3119	A
oh good	3119	A
that's right	3119	A
that's right and my kids help a lot my son um uh tried to or helped build a	3119	A
a little recycling center for us here at the house you know put to put the cans in and uh	3119	A
papers and uh plastic and so forth so we have a little place that he built out in the garage and	3119	A
uh so until we get curbside service we cart it all over every once in a while but they're real good about it um	3119	A
they're real responsible much better than i am really about um sorting things out so	3119	A
um	3119	A
so they've done a real good job	3119	A
oh good idea	3119	A
oh that's great	3119	A
and you can put it back in your copy machine and just run it on through can't you yeah	3119	A
uh-huh i bet	3119	A
huh	3119	A
well we just need to do more and more	3119	A
right	3119	A
more people doing that yeah	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
is that right	3119	A
huh	3119	A
i've never heard of that either	3119	A
interesting	3119	A
interesting	3119	A
well and that the other issue is disposable diapers	3119	A
um and i i guess some companies are beginning to do some things uh to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded	3119	A
um but we did an interesting thing in my classroom um calculating the number of uh diapers that were used for my class of kids just	3119	A
in the time that they would have been the age to wear diapers and uh the kids were just astounded	3119	A
and then we calculated according- according to the number of kids in the school and that kind of thing and	3119	A
so that you know that's a real eye-opening um activity to do because you you begin to think of the	3119	A
thousands and millions and billions of diapers that are still there oh it's that's incredible	3119	A
um-hum	3119	A
that's right	3119	A
yeah	3119	A
okay	3119	B
do you have yeah there's a recycle center in Plano isn't there	3119	B
oh really that'd be neat	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
that i would love i wish Carrollton would do that	3119	B
well i'm i live- fortunately live live pretty- pretty close to the Wal-Mart and there's a pretty good size recycle center behind the Wal-Mart so it's convenient for me to do it but curbside would be much more convenient	3119	B
yes i know	3119	B
oh really	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
yeah my husband is a landscaper and so they all bought the recycled- or the mulching mowers so that they don't they don't bag anything anymore	3119	B
so it was i i know it cut down on his work load but it's also being helpful	3119	B
yeah it vacuums it up and back up into the air several times and chops it up so fine that	3119	B
you know it really- it really is what from what i understand helpful to the grass and then plus you don't have the big bags of of grass every time	3119	B
yeah yeah so	3119	B
yeah we have plastic- at this center we have plastic glass aluminum and newspapers	3119	B
but uh the i noticed going to work the other day there's a warehouse or paper company and they buy like your office paper that you've used	3119	B
yeah and so i've started that in my office but it's kind of it's not as convenient because they want you to have a certain amount before you'll take it to them_1	3119	B
and i don't really care if i get paid for it i just don't want it you know i just want it out of my office and i don't want to waste it	3119	B
but i was reading in a magazine the other day and i hadn't even thought about doing this that um a lady mainly- mainly for cost cutting reasons	3119	B
has memo- sent out a memo to everybody in her company that says if you're sending out interoffice memos it's got to be on the backside of a paper that's already been used	3119	B
yeah and i hadn't thought about that so i'm going to make everybody start doing that they think i'm nuts	3119	B
well i know i mean i showed them_1 the brochure that the city sent out that you know explained how many if you	3119	B
recycle this many cans this much power's saved and all this stuff so i think they're beginning to get a little more aware of it but	3119	B
oh they all they laughed at me and brought me Greenpeace stickers and	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
oh	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
it really is	3119	B
i've gotten my husband kind of trained now because_1 it's real funny because_1 i would pull a jar out and rinse it out to put in the glass and he'd throw it away	3119	B
but you know i don't i don't have any kids yet and that's what they kept stressing in a lot of the brochures is if your kids are going to you know be able to survive at all without having mounds of trash around them_1 everybody's got to start doing this	3119	B
oh that's good	3119	B
well that's neat	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
huh	3119	B
yeah well i'm anxious to get it little more implemented into my office i've got the aluminum cans out and i've got the	3119	B
newspapers where everybody's- everybody's pretty much aware of that because_1 they get yelled at if they throw their uh	3119	B
but now what i'm going to do with this recycled office paper is uh just get separate trash cans and	3119	B
tell them to put their trash in this one and the paper that can be recycled in that one and hopefully hopefully they'll go along with it	3119	B
so	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
so i i don't know we'll see but um that lady said she was real surprised that she did get a lot of protest at first but she said it's cut down on their office expenses a lot and	3119	B
it's just recycling so anyway we'll see	3119	B
yeah but i mean i guess there's only so much they can do as far as recycle- as advanced stuff now but something else that i'd really like to get into more and i haven't is	3119	B
the like the Downy softener products and stuff that you just buy the concentrate	3119	B
i wish they'd get more into that	3119	B
yeah and even just the companies coming out with more things like that	3119	B
so i don't know i- i know a lot of companies are real dedicated to it i just got a brochure from my insurance company the other day and	3119	B
the whole thing was made on recycled paper and then something i hadn't heard of is they the ink was produced with with uh soy based oils instead of	3119	B
petroleum- instead of petroleum because_1 they said it was less toxic and i had never heard of that	3119	B
but i mean they made a big deal to let everybody know that whole brochure was recycled and can be recycled again	3119	B
yeah it really was	3119	B
oh yeah	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
oh my gosh	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
wow	3119	B
yeah	3119	B
oh	3119	B
well	3119	B
one of my girlfriends recently had a baby and she goes about half and half	3119	B
she uses the cloth diapers at home but she said when you're traveling it's just almost impossible	3119	B
so she says she feels like she's doing her part some because she's not using them_1 all the time	3119	B
but yeah that's something i kind of been thinking about because_1 we haven't had children yet and i thought oh God	3119	B
well we haven't traveled outside the United States that much um we usually take family type vacations we're looking forward to one in October to Disneyworld in Florida	3171	B
a have a nine year old when when both of my kids were much younger and this time we're gonna be going with just one daughter and she's nine so it ought to just be a ball	3171	B
uh-huh i think so too	3171	B
oh wonderful so you travel a lot	3171	B
uh-huh	3171	B
sure	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
oh that'll be fun too yes we went years ago we haven't been lately and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there	3171	B
uh-huh	3171	B
yeah if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there but that can be fun	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
no i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows	3171	B
yes be excited about all of it	3171	B
well not really uh we're doing the same thing tying it in with my husband's business trip and i just save vacation for things like that and uh just travel whenever we can	3171	B
how easy	3171	B
right	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
sure	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
um-hum so that's perfect what more could you ask for	3171	B
and then get to pick and choose the places	3171	B
ah	3171	B
uh-huh	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
right it's kind of shaky	3171	B
that's true it really is	3171	B
um-hum our last big trip we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and and uh	3171	B
back through Silverton and Durango and oh it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
right	3171	B
um-hum	3171	B
um-hum oh there's so- too much to see really you just	3171	B
where is your favorite place to go	3171	A
oh that's great have you ever been there	3171	A
oh that's a perfect age for Disneyworld	3171	A
oh that's great yeah so we've been there a number of times and uh we're going next year we have a business trip every fall well we go on a lot of business trips i	3171	A
i don't work well we do we go my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if i go along	3171	A
so it's great i just kind of join up when it's something interesting and uh Disneyworld is the one for a week next year	3171	A
and it'll be at this time of the year and this year we're leaving um uh matter of fact we're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans	3171	A
have have you ever been there	3171	A
well you know we went there once in fact we had been in Dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to New Orleans so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a	3171	A
it well and- and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned	3171	A
and i'm kind of anxious for that but um yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better	3171	A
did you know that next week there's several TV shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary	3171	A
well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind	3171	A
uh if- so uh well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go	3171	A
oh that's	3171	A
and really at our point of life our children are grown and um it has just worked out really well with this um	3171	A
position he's in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going	3171	A
whether or not i decide to go along but i do do like to travel and it's um i don't mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop	3171	A
that's right but if this-	3171	A
well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas um that i would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas um probably once every maybe year and a half	3171	A
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental	3171	A
uh so we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for	3171	A
just kind of a quick trip um when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas	3171	A
i think that's a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent	3171	A
now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the	3171	A
what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah	3171	A
and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great	3171	A
oh i- i think that's that's the way to	3171	A
all right well i am uh the product of uh	3103	B
i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone my mother uh we come from a my mother and i were uh really practice- first generation divorce in our family	3103	B
my uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty seven	3103	B
when i was seven years old and was i was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known to have a divorce	3103	B
of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States uh my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my father's side of the family and also uh	3103	B
uh	3103	B
uh we were uh ostracized by his family uh basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth	3103	B
and they all felt that there- there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce	3103	B
uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude	3103	B
so uh yeah it was too bad it was really rough	3103	B
uh so you know that's so you know changing some of the changing roles of women in that respect i have been a product of	3103	B
um i think that there are people that i think that uh i was a i was first generation going to college in my family	3103	B
uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession- profession in Des Moines Iowa	3103	B
she was a secretary to uh uh the judge- uh to a circuit court judge federal judge and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him so that was a really high high status position she made over thirty thousand dollars a year	3103	B
well yeah she a real hard lady- yeah hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know	3103	B
but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees and i am the director of music in a church um and but it's interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with	3103	B
absolutely challenges that have to do with my sex uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know at professions	3103	B
as many of the woman- as many of the men who are doing the same job i do	3103	B
and uh the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly	3103	B
they question my authority more uh than they ever would a man and i have experience with this because i work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man	3103	B
so i am pretty i am pretty obvious- pretty constant- i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church so basically that's that's well i am done talking do you want to talk	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
oh always	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
indeed	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women i i have never been able to understand that i guess it's fear i- i mean what	3103	B
sure	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3103	B
men have a lot of trouble with that though	3103	B
they in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals they are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower	3103	B
uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way and i do not know if that's i mean that's it's a militaristic point of view i guess you know somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but it's just really interesting to me i am married to a wonderful man	3103	B
you know who treats me very you know with a with as i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues	3103	B
it's never over you know it's always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and i am the you know and i am the slave and it those are the only only issues we ever fight about	3103	B
i think it's just i think it's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient	3103	B
um	3103	B
um	3103	B
um	3103	B
um	3103	B
hm	3103	B
huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3103	B
yeah it's true	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
um-hum	3103	B
uh-huh it would be	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
uh-huh	3103	B
okay	3103	A
yes	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
right	3103	A
oh mercy	3103	A
yeah that that's too bad	3103	A
um um that's sad it really is	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
that's that's wonderful	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
well that's wonderful that speaks well of your mother	3103	A
she had high standards yeah	3103	A
oh bless her heart	3103	A
challenges	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
right	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
uh uh-huh	3103	A
surely	3103	A
well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie and i can uh relate to that uh	3103	A
uh i think it's it's the image that the woman has and uh in the world as uh	3103	A
uh the lesser of the two	3103	A
and uh i think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to	3103	A
like it to take and uh i think we are progressing at a snail's pace but we are progressing	3103	A
so that's the main point is that we are going ahead	3103	A
and uh i think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve and uh	3103	A
men uh have a lot of them have uh come around and have seen the error of their ways	3103	A
but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change so we have to uh face that reality also	3103	A
it could be if they are after- they are not sure of themselves	3103	A
the one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves	3103	A
and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level	3103	A
and they do not have any uh	3103	A
ego	3103	A
uh problems that they are fighting	3103	A
and uh	3103	A
i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term	3103	A
uh	3103	A
and i what i would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes uh	3103	A
we each have our uh jobs in life and that we should recognize that and that we should support each other	3103	A
and uh i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other	3103	A
and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal	3103	A
uh-huh	3103	A
uh	3103	A
hm uh-huh uh-huh	3103	A
well uh i guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us and uh	3103	A
the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands	3103	A
and i believe that strongly	3103	A
and uh but i think that they should be in harmony	3103	A
with what they are with what the subject matter is	3103	A
and i think the issue should be settled	3103	A
before there's a conflict	3103	A
uh and i think that can happen in a very wonderful- wonderful way	3103	A
and if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves can you picture that	3103	A
i mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself	3103	A
and uh	3103	A
that's really the the divine answer and and the right answer so uh uh	3103	A
that would be a beautiful	3103	A
relationship	3103	A
and i think there are some people that	3103	A
have done that and i have seen it and it's it's just marvelous and i am just in awe to see this	3103	A
so how do you feel about capital punishment	3150	B
really	3150	B
oh i'm pretty much for it	3150	B
we'll have some interesting discussion i guess	3150	B
wrongfully yeah yeah	3150	B
yeah it would never be equal	3150	B
right	3150	B
right yeah	3150	B
well i guess	3150	B
you know i i guess i can see it from several different perspectives but	3150	B
you know when i hear about things like you know what they've what they've been reporting about in Milwaukee	3150	B
you know i- i- i to me i don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy you know maybe there is i don't know	3150	B
but you know and	3150	B
you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society he's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation	3150	B
i mean i don't know i just i really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko	3150	B
and you know for the things he's done i don't know i guess it's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life	3150	B
you know or or capital punishment i guess you know and	3150	B
it-	3150	B
uh-huh	3150	B
oh really uh-huh uh-huh	3150	B
right	3150	B
yeah well i can understand- i i mean you know there there is always that chance but you know	3150	B
i guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i don't i mean i don't know but uh you know	3150	B
that that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be	3150	B
you know you you you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really	3150	B
but uh	3150	B
uh you know when i when you find somebody just like that situation i mean it was disgusting when i read about it today and and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven	3150	B
i i'd you know i guess i have a hard time feeling merciful toward him and you know	3150	B
right	3150	B
right	3150	B
right and trying to rehabilitate him too and you know	3150	B
right exactly you know and nobody wants that you know know everybody would be just be scared to death	3150	B
you know we've we've had a real problem here in Texas with uh prison overcrowding and they've been releasing people left and right and you know they've committed murders and rapes and everything else and	3150	B
you know you just think you know where's the justice here i mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving	3150	B
oh really	3150	B
uh-huh	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
uh-huh	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
right exactly yeah well you know that's exactly i mean	3150	B
i'm i'm not saying i i think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know and i i think there's a a shadow of a doubt	3150	B
you know like like with this this guy in in Milwaukee i mean it he pretty much confessed to it i mean they you know just everything i mean cannibalism and everything else uh	3150	B
i- i really would have a hard time especially if i was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed yeah	3150	B
because_1 i mean that's just awful	3150	B
right- right and well i have a hunch- i have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either i mean you know they i don't know from from what i hear about jail life is not any- any way to live but uh	3150	B
i don't know it's just	3150	B
and i	3150	B
um-hum	3150	B
really	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
yeah	3150	B
that	3150	B
yeah well you know especially- especially like repeat offenders it it just appalls me that they can be out	3150	B
you know they even get a a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years	3150	B
you know that's that's scary because you know i'm not sure	3150	B
i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not	3150	B
right	3150	B
and it it's it's really scary i mean- you know i i don't know what the perfect solution to that is but i know that especially with violent crimes where you know you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else you know then	3150	B
i don't know i i guess	3150	B
i i just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee you know for instance i mean that's just i could see capital punishment in a case like that	3150	B
and you know for for other people too that do things like that	3150	B
but uh when uh my wife and i are both participating in this survey and she picked up the phone and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment so she was uh	3150	B
yeah well luckily it was for me because_1 they won't uh they- they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other	3150	B
so she tried to enter her number and it wouldn't work so she said whew it's for you so	3150	B
but uh you know i don't know i i struggle with it but i i really think that in	3150	B
in terms like this i	3150	B
i think that it that it might not be such a bad thing	3150	B
because i don't know that anybody would- in i don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community you know i i i'm sure- you'd have to be scared to death	3150	B
well it's i am pretty much against it	3150	A
yeah how about you	3150	A
oh good we can have a debate	3150	A
well like um	3150	A
i don't know i can't- think that i one of the reasons that i'm against it is that uh um i'm afraid- afraid of someone losing their life for something- um wrongly	3150	A
right and another reason one- one of the arguments that really i really actually- actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really uh uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh	3150	A
you know someone said to me once well imagine if- if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldn't you want to see them killed	3150	A
for the punishment but then i thought about it and i thought well the loss that i would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them	3150	A
how about you	3150	A
yeah that's true	3150	A
um-hum	3150	A
right well you know that's true because uh my- but a lot of um these conversations i've had on this program this	3150	A
these telephone conversations have revolved around um	3150	A
criminal	3150	A
um-hum	3150	A
right especially when it's so far removed if it's no one that i know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life	3150	A
letting him out again	3150	A
um-hum	3150	A
uh-huh	3150	A
that's true you know i just recently moved to Massachusetts i'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but uh	3150	A
and i guess they said you know should- do you think it should be restricted i guess if it were if if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment i guess violent crimes would be the	3150	A
crimes where i can see it making the most sense you know violent crimes with no uh with just malicious intent	3150	A
yeah	3150	A
hang	3150	A
and what is he going to do in prison to the other people	3150	A
right	3150	A
well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back she was off drugs and everything but she said you know	3150	A
in prison you can get anything you can get any drugs you want there's you can- it's just like being outside you know people find ways around and and there's a power structure that you have to bow to and	3150	A
and it really isn't for some people that- who have been there uh for over and over and over it really isn't uh as bad- i mean there it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect	3150	A
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation and	3150	A
maybe that's why one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it's not so scary anymore	3150	A
right and what they're going to be doing when they get out	3150	A
handed it to you	3150	A
oh oh i see	3150	A
well maybe if they could um if they had more money or more more resources to work more on rehabilitation i mean deep down i think every every human	3150	A
it seems to be a a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two	3156	A
and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break	3156	A
i um wasn't raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they they tended to wanna	3156	A
grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and	3156	A
we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out and they weren't worth anything anymore	3156	A
and we it took us um	3156	A
almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion	3156	A
of Dr Pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in	3156	A
uh at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about_1 a dollar	3156	A
it just really wasn't worth it yeah so they they realized you know well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that wasn't uh that was a big deal but	3156	A
we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it and then um	3156	A
TI started keeping up with uh cans there so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them_1 in there	3156	A
least it gets back into the system but um as far as a habit at the house uh	3156	A
i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up	3156	A
have y'all got the individual containers yet	3156	A
hm	3156	A
right yeah it seemed like uh if if i recall it's been a long time they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just gonna have a bin	3156	A
and all sorts- different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed it it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly	3156	A
and that at at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well	3156	A
uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses	3156	A
um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so	3156	A
they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than	3156	A
than having a household try it but i- i don't know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house	3156	A
yeah yeah	3156	A
right	3156	A
that's true	3156	A
right	3156	A
yeah	3156	A
they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them_1 but	3156	A
uh they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day and	3156	A
yeah just a little bit of begging will	3156	A
right	3156	A
well i wonder if	3156	A
yeah	3156	A
right yep	3156	A
where do you take your cans	3156	A
um-hum	3156	B
and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying yeah	3156	B
no i read in the paper this week where maybe i don't know if it was- was i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them_1 up is outfitted in time	3156	B
but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that	3156	B
uh i'm not sure all what we're gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything	3156	B
um-hum	3156	B
oh well	3156	B
um-hum	3156	B
well it'd get messy too	3156	B
i- i- i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot	3156	B
and uh which we're not in the habit of doing i was brought up uh you know long time ago that	3156	B
they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the the grocery store and you'd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they don't seem to still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but	3156	B
i guess this day and age they don't	3156	B
um-hum	3156	B
um-hum yeah and they uh people- i- i think kids don't	3156	B
appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care they can get more somewhere else uh for a good many	3156	B
to care that that much about a small amount of money	3156	B
but now we we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety nine cents so i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before um it was just easier	3156	B
to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat	3156	B
well as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer we i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't taken- oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them_1 to a	3156	B
a recycling place probably at one of the	3156	B
libraries-	3156	B
okay well having uh personally uh helped uh two children attend or or to select colleges one of them not very successfully	3117	A
i'm not sure if i'm any authority on this topic at all	3117	A
well our daughter uh went to the University of Virginia that was a good selection she	3117	A
yeah really is and she was she was very very happy there and very- and very successful in what she picked to do so uh she's just graduated from there so that was a good selection	3117	A
uh our son has this kind of you know he's	3117	A
well he started out going Stephen F Austin and that turned turned into you know flunking out because of of of uh too many parties going on then he stayed out of school for a while then he went to Richland for a couple of years and then he went to	3117	A
to DePaul in Chicago which would have been great but uh it was so expensive so now he's now he's back	3117	A
well in in that case with him uh he kind of made the selections by himself and i think that we should have given him more direction and	3117	A
he was our first you know so we we didn't have quite the insight that uh that we would have had if he'd been our second like we did with Karen so uh	3117	A
but i i think you know i- just in terms of of what happened i think that first of all i'd i would know the reputation of the school	3117	A
and uh for more than just academics but you know if it's a party school or not although i think every school is a party school to some degree personally	3117	A
right	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
right	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
right	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
yeah i've heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma	3117	A
yeah and uh when i was there it was maybe eleven or twelve thousand people which was just a great size i thought it's it's	3117	A
oh gosh is awful	3117	A
uh-huh yeah	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
yes that that's true it makes a lot of difference and uh	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
you went to school there yeah right uh-huh	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
sure oh yeah yeah well our daughter chose uh Virginia because she didn't want to go to school in Texas i mean she just sort of didn't want to go to school here	3117	A
uh-huh	3117	A
yeah same deal	3117	A
yeah and uh in fact she was accepted at two schools in Texas uh Rice and Trinity but she decided she wanted to go out of state and uh	3117	A
Virginia was uh you know in the east it wasn't a you know it wasn't an Ivy League school but it was well it's further- quite a bit further east and it was uh	3117	A
of the state schools that she could have gone to it was but one of the cheapest yet one of the best too- you know with the the academics and the tradition and everything that is there uh she made a really good selection we thought and	3117	A
so uh uh she pretty much made that herself- herself but she did have some others in the wings you know there's another school that she she would've have have gone to if she hadn't been accepted there	3117	A
so uh i don't know i think it- it really depends a lot on the child because our daughter is was just a lot more levelheaded about her process- the process	3117	A
yeah so uh but you know i guess you have to really look at your finances and uh Texas has such a bargain in education i mean	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
i know i know	3117	A
uh that's something	3117	A
uh	3117	A
oh wow	3117	A
my gosh	3117	A
that was a shocker	3117	A
no i'll bet not	3117	A
yeah yeah yeah i know how that is	3117	A
you you did pay yours good yeah my husband went to school on loans too and and we he was able you know we paid his off after we were married but uh well i'm at the university of Texas at Dallas and as a graduate student and uh	3117	A
you know i have to say that uh it's a real bargain i mean for as far as i'm concerned it's been a real bargain of course you know living at home makes a lot of difference if i had to to pay room and board somewhere that would make a lot of difference uh in	3117	A
uh i think uh on a yearly basis i'm trying to think i would just make it a rough figure of about	3117	A
uh with with the travel expenses and so on although she didn't come home that much actually i would say between twelve and thirteen thousand a year	3117	A
it's not when you look at the you know the school and the fact that she was	3117	A
uh no on the lawn no no that's that's an honor that's bestowed on very few and she didn't get to do that although she knew people who did live there but yeah that's that would have been neat	3117	A
well you know the graduation takes place right there on the lawn on on that in that big fat grassy area and uh	3117	A
they had four thousand graduates this spring and boy that was quite an event i'll tell you	3117	A
oh yeah	3117	A
yeah	3117	A
that's a great place to visit that really is yeah	3117	A
yeah well they're just so it's just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know they're they still talk about Mister Jefferson you know i mean the founder of the school of course was Mister Jefferson- Thomas Jefferson and they and and a lot of	3117	A
right uh-huh and and a lot of the of his traditions i mean for instance they don't call the students freshmen sophomore junior senior they call them first year second year third year and fourth year because Mister Jefferson felt that one's education never ended	3117	A
and to you put those four designations of freshmen sophomore and so on on the person's education limited them	3117	A
and he felt that you could go on to school forever you should just have the number of years that you were there attached to your name if you want to do identify someone so	3117	A
i had to be very careful about talking about seniors or fourth year students you got to get the terminology right	3117	A
yes	3117	A
all righty	3117	A
yes it certainly is i got to go make it here	3117	A
well i i this is my last one you're number ten of ten that i i	3117	A
well which colleges did they go to	3117	B
that's a beautiful school beautiful school	3117	B
well i guess the question then becomes how did you all make the selection or did you just let them do them by themselves	3117	B
well that's true of course uh you know i- for me my son he's only six and but i had the experience with my sister going to school and she was i treated my sister almost like my daughter because she was nine ten years younger than i was and	3117	B
she ended up going to the University of Oklahoma	3117	B
i can say that because it was a big well known school it had a well known education and it was a wonderful education but yet it was a small school	3117	B
whereas i went to the University of Texas which was you know a million people go there	3117	B
i think that for me it's going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big	3117	B
it's way too big	3117	B
yes yes i'm i'm quite aware	3117	B
Texas only had fifty five thousand when i was there	3117	B
and- and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction between uh students i knew everybody within my dorm but that was it	3117	B
because the school was just too big and whereas my sister when i went to visit her she knew everybody on the whole durn campus	3117	B
so uh course now we're we're already telling our son you know Texas- uh Oklahoma's good and Arkansas is good now of course Texas is good only because you know	3117	B
i went- because i went there of course but uh	3117	B
we're going my parents let me choose on my own and i want to pretty much allow him to choose on his own but i kind of keep an ear open as to what he's doing	3117	B
well i was when i was in Louisiana in Shreveport i would go to any school except LSU i did not want to school in the in the same state	3117	B
luckily i still have twelve more years to worry about it	3117	B
right now they do now if the uh legislature has their way about it they gonna to uh raise tuition- tuition in in double	3117	B
and see back when i went to school there when i first entered the school it cost me two hundred dollars as an out as an out of state student	3117	B
but then i was there for about two and a half years they then switched it to forty dollars per semester hour so almost overnight i went from two hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars	3117	B
and i have to admit uh	3117	B
i wasn't i wasn't quite ready for that one	3117	B
it took me only about twelve years after i graduated to finish paying off the bill but that's	3117	B
but at least i was one of the good guys i did pay my bill off in full yes i did yeah	3117	B
yeah	3117	B
well what about the University of Virginia how much did it end- end up costing	3117	B
that's a long way	3117	B
uh that's not too bad	3117	B
now did she get to did she get to live in the dorm on that uh very front row you know that goes up by the rotunda	3117	B
when we went to visit it we didn't know what it was and my little kid he was opening every one of the mailboxes looking inside to see what he could find	3117	B
yeah	3117	B
yeah we went on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year and we went to visit that was the very last thing we saw was at the tail end of the Parkway we had we had a blast	3117	B
it is it it i can see why you want to go there that's	3117	B
uh-huh and of course you've got to go to say hello to Monticello yeah yeah	3117	B
huh	3117	B
well i tell you what i've enjoyed talking i'm going to go ahead and hang up on this end because it's just about time for supper so	3117	B
actually it it was a fun conversation i enjoyed it	3117	B
congratulations- well congratulations-	3117	B
okay	3109	A
all the goodies	3109	A
an Oldsmobile had you owned Oldsmobiles before	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
and you what just the memory of that made you go to Oldsmobile again or	3109	A
oh yeah	3109	A
um-hum um-hum you are you still driving that car	3109	A
how old is it now	3109	A
eighty five are you going to be looking again soon or how long do you normally keep cars for a long time or	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
was it still under warranty or	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
you put a lot of miles on a car or	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
for what almost six well six years huh	3109	A
um-hum um-hum	3109	A
well we don't we don't buy new cars that often we drive them_1 you know until they get	3109	A
maybe seven or eight years old and then	3109	A
we'll what we'll do is sell off we'll have one about seven say and one twelve or thirteen years old and we'll get rid of it and then we'll	3109	A
buy a new one and and uh i guess right now we have a	3109	A
a seventy eight Chevy wagon and then a a four year old uh Crown Victoria that i love and	3109	A
uh-huh well my husband's my husband got to chose choose the make and then i got everything else	3109	A
he he he likes Fords and my youngest son still lives at home he's in in college but he drives an old Ford seventy seven Ford pick up	3109	A
that he loves but	3109	A
no i this was the last year they made the big Crown Victoria and before they started chopping it up and making it look ugly so i it look- i- i guess some people think it looks boxy but	3109	A
always like to to have a room in a car i'm not into compacts i like	3109	A
something you can relax in	3109	A
right	3109	A
well that's not that's a good choice for a child i think to start to start to drive in	3109	A
our oldest one started in a old Datsun of ours but our second one	3109	A
not well just for safety's sake	3109	A
and i don't know i- i look at the new ones on the market now and the the bodies are so	3109	A
sleek i guess for wind resistance you know and and uh they just don't look like they're roomy inside i guess they are i haven't been looking at them to	3109	A
oh really	3109	A
uh-huh is it supposed to seat six	3109	A
uh okay	3109	A
a lot of knee room in the back or	3109	A
um-hum	3109	A
yeah	3109	A
right right	3109	A
well i even- even in our car i know like when my husband and my sons and sons-in-law all have long legs they're tall people and so if one of like my husband's driving then he soot scoots his seat back	3109	A
and so we can't put a we can't put a tall person with long legs behind him	3109	A
so it	3109	A
oh my word yeah you're like my son-in-law yeah	3109	A
fine back there but you couldn't put a a real long legged person back there comfortably	3109	A
right well- well yeah i wonder sometimes you know we have the Dallas Mavericks here that play and they'll show them sometimes on TV and they've all got these real low sports cars	3109	A
and i	3109	A
Corvette yeah	3109	A
well even to get out of it though i mean you're you're only a foot off the ground at the most	3109	A
and it's got to be you know you can't get your leg out and so i- i thought i always you always see them standing by it you know if they're advertising they don't ever show them getting in and out	3109	A
and i thought i that's the part i'd like to see	3109	A
right well listen i never had a car that's had the swivel seats that where you can like when you're wanting to get out you just turn it to the side and then your feet are	3109	A
and and i don't even know if they i know for a while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat	3109	A
a neat thing to have but i- i for some reason they don't carry them and i don't know if they found they were unsafe or	3109	A
you know maybe to do that they had couldn't make them where they were just real stable	3109	A
one thing our does- our car doesn't have that i'd look for in another car is that that little	3109	A
so they i guess that's the year they learned that's not a good idea because it just comes right off the roof and straight down and just you know i try to put an umbrella up there but that doesn't help too much it just	3109	A
so i get the interior wet and i don't like to do that just along the side there	3109	A
well i- i don't know we	3109	A
how many inches do you all average a year	3109	A
how many inches do you average a year	3109	A
you just have had a lot	3109	A
is it is it uh a kind of a dirty rain you know i i've never been down in there but you always here how polluted with all the oil	3109	A
it's not	3109	A
it's not	3109	A
well i- i didn't course	3109	A
oh it is up here too it is everywhere but	3109	A
with all the oil right right that's where i was thinking of	3109	A
that doesn't that doesn't affect	3109	A
ah	3109	A
then you don't have any trouble with the water or	3109	A
oh my	3109	A
well i just	3109	A
i- i don't know i you know i just hear that when you read about Houston seems like they're course all their advertising or not advertising but news reporting is maybe an oil	3109	A
refinery blowing up or something like that you don't ever i- i need to get down that way i guess sometime when i retire	3109	A
see what they have	3109	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3109	A
hum	3109	A
hum	3109	A
yeah i that was where they had	3109	A
when the economy went bad a couple years back they had all the limousines for such good buys	3109	A
we had one of our principals at our of a school here in Plano an elementary school went down and bought one	3109	A
it was just a	3109	A
well they they just said you can you know the limousine companies were going out of busy and and you could pick one up for	3109	A
for a real good buy and they had supposedly in Houston they had a lot of them_1	3109	A
so i thought well that i don't know we even debated about that at that time but decided no that wasn't the	3109	A
that wasn't the route when our kids were little we had a van which we loved for for traveling we had four kids and they just that allowed them to really move around	3109	A
i had uh just	3109	B
my last car i bought was a new one i ordered it from uh you know from the factory with all the little options and stuff i wanted on it	3109	B
it was a Oldsmobile	3109	B
yes i had i liked uh	3109	B
i had had a four four two and i when i was younger and that was uh	3109	B
quite a car	3109	B
uh well i looked around uh	3109	B
i think it may have had some influence i just liked uh	3109	B
this particular car it was a good buy i got it through the TI	3109	B
they had at the time the fleet purchase agreement	3109	B
so that uh took a lot of the hassle out of it	3109	B
and uh you know i got all the things i wanted the sunroof and the luggage rack and all that	3109	B
um-hum	3109	B
it was eighty five	3109	B
well uh i am now i've uh	3109	B
although i was look like i might have to but because i had a little trouble with it i had to have a valve job and so forth done on it	3109	B
seem to be running pretty good now	3109	B
oh no no this was just recently	3109	B
uh yeah i do a pretty good bit i've got about ninety six thousand on this one here	3109	B
yeah i drive about eighteen miles out to the plant and back	3109	B
each day i mean each way	3109	B
thirty six miles a day	3109	B
uh-huh	3109	B
you like Fords huh	3109	B
uh-huh	3109	B
uh	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
oh yeah	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
that was uh	3109	B
something we uh	3109	B
were interested in for our kids while they were learning how to drive was a pretty good size car although two of them_1 decided on trucks pickup trucks	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
yeah that's	3109	B
well that's true i mean they uh they should have a little car around them	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
plastic	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
well there's a lot less room in this one i have than the earlier ones i've had yeah this is supposedly a	3109	B
i guess they call it a midsize car but	3109	B
yeah it uh well no it's a it's got bucket seats in the front and you can fit you can fit five people in it	3109	B
it's fair uh	3109	B
nothing	3109	B
anything like your Crown Victoria	3109	B
just you know you can sit in there and it's it's reasonably comfortable	3109	B
i don't sit back there very often	3109	B
yeah me too	3109	B
same here six- i'm six foot four so	3109	B
well-	3109	B
that influences my car purchase decision too because i can't really get in a lot of these Toyotas and Hondas and stuff	3109	B
um-hum	3109	B
maybe yeah well now sports cars they have a lot of room for your legs you know you kind of sit- lay	3109	B
you get into a little more of a reclining position	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
yeah their feet go way up under i've driven uh you know a Camaro- i mean uh	3109	B
yeah Chevy sports car Corvette and	3109	B
you got to	3109	B
that's true	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
the unfolding and folding act	3109	B
no i haven't either	3109	B
looks like a real good idea to me	3109	B
hum	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
um-hum	3109	B
well you all don't get as much rain near Plano as we do here i'll bet	3109	B
sure been wet this i never seen a spring like this	3109	B
huh	3109	B
oh i don't know but we're way we must be way above average this year because_1 it's been terrible just rain rain rain	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
no we're no	3109	B
huh-uh	3109	B
it's just rain	3109	B
no it's uh i don't think it's any particularly polluted here i mean you can	3109	B
i guess if you went uh if you went over by the refineries and stuff you might	3109	B
no that doesn't	3109	B
huh-uh no we never notice that over here we live on the northwest side	3109	B
<b_aside> hi there mister Colombian <e_aside>	3109	B
just had a friend come back from Colombia	3109	B
uh-huh	3109	B
they have a	3109	B
well yeah it's not that far	3109	B
they have a they have a	3109	B
they have a uh big you know it's a big complexes all around the ship channel over on the east east side of town southeast	3109	B
other than that you know it's a nice clean city real modern	3109	B
yeah	3109	B
uh-huh	3109	B
um	3109	B
yeah never heard of limousines being a good buy know we had plenty of real estate though	3109	B
oh yeah oh i guess that's true yeah	3109	B
oh yeah	3109	B
we did	3109	B
we had	3109	B
okay you have three boys i had two boys and two girls	3127	A
my youngest is college age but he is so he's still around occasionally but um he's he's twenty two and in his last year of college	3127	A
but uh we were very active with them when they were young whatever they were in gymnastics or soccer or baseball or basketball whatever we were always involved in the parent club and	3127	A
coached some and went to all the games and	3127	A
and course in Plano that's a big deal we'd even where we lived in Albuquerque before there's a lot of parent involvement in children's lives	3127	A
how about where you are	3127	A
oh	3127	A
oh my	3127	A
right	3127	A
oh dear	3127	A
yeah he's learning from the big brothers huh that's neat though and sometimes those that see their older brothers do it turn out to be pretty good because they pick up skills	3127	A
seems naturally you know just they start so young just kicking the ball and are are you pretty involved with with their uh	3127	A
do you coach them_1 or go out to parent nights	3127	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3127	A
oh	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
right	3127	A
right	3127	A
right right it- well that's seems to be a a pretty current trend i i work in the schools and i see a lot of kids that	3127	A
obviously are looking for a family and usually find it within a group at school rather than	3127	A
at home because their parents are off working or uh usually- you know a lot of times it's a single mother trying to raise and of course i i deal with adolescents so that's where it fourteen fifteen that's where it really starts coming out this	3127	A
lack of of uh family life	3127	A
well uh they look for their security and their uh self-esteem uh outside of the home and usually in the wrong groups	3127	A
and and uh	3127	A
right and they find that they're very easily unfortunately uh the kids who make them feel the most welcome	3127	A
when new students come into school are the kids that are are uh on drugs or party a lot on weekends and things like that and and uh	3127	A
they're the first- but they are the first ones that will come up and say you know you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you to your classes and things like that and and uh	3127	A
when you've got a a child that's just coming from a situation a move is a terrible thing on a child it's it's just such a traumatic especially if they've lived for any length of time	3127	A
in- in the first place and they come up here and no friends and here are these people just throwing themselves and before you know it you've got a a kid involved in things you don't want them involved in and	3127	A
and most of the time the move is made and then mom and daddy go right back to work right away and the kid's coming home to an empty house or they're coming home to take care of little brothers and sisters and and uh you've got these ready made friends just ready to go	3127	A
and and uh i you- i don't know	3127	A
what the answer is because i am a working woman and and i don't like to say if the women would stay home any more than i like to say if the men would stay home and and it's	3127	A
right when-	3127	A
when my youngest was in third grade i went back to work but i stayed home up until then when by that time my oldest was	3127	A
oh she's about	3127	A
six years older than he is so she must have been in about uh	3127	A
tenth grade i guess my oldest was and i had one in tenth and one in ninth and one in eighth and then this third grader and and uh	3127	A
but i went to work for the school district where i was home in the summer i had two weeks off at Christmas i got- left school at three- four o'clock every day and was home	3127	A
to take them_1 to anything they needed to go to in the afternoons	3127	A
uh no in the schools i i uh i did work some summers but it was never my work never took uh first place if if my kids needed me or needed to go somewhere that's where i was	3127	A
and	3127	A
um i when my youngest was in elementary school i worked at in his elementary school for three years	3127	A
and uh but i had an understanding with the principal that under no circumstances was i to be treated any differently i don't want i said i don't want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldn't get to anybody else's mother in the middle of the day	3127	A
that that it would be handled the same way they handled- dealt with other parents- other kids	3127	A
it it gets real easy when a mother is in a school or a father even for a teacher to	3127	A
every time some little thing goes wrong to run and pretty soon all you're hearing is negative things so it you know and those things need to be dealt with in the classroom by the teacher and not tattled necessarily	3127	A
but it it	3127	A
it worked well	3127	A
it worked well with me and i and i told the principal i said if if uh my student my child does something that you feel deserves licks or some other discipline have at it you know i'm i'm i have always	3127	A
wanted them to respect rules and teachers and and uh	3127	A
i don't want them to think that i'm going to come riding to the rescue where every time something happens but	3127	A
right	3127	A
well i think unfortunately what what we're seeing in the very few of the instances is that	3127	A
uh for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the day their idea of parenting is	3127	A
to come riding to the rescue and take their child's side without knowing	3127	A
the whole story or even when they do know the whole story	3127	A
it's it's either another student's fault or it's another it's a teacher's fault or it's- it's anybody's and they	3127	A
consider that being a good parent and that what if when really what the child needs is their attention more of the time and it's	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
um-hum	3127	A
it it it's and it's- it's difficult i understand i i know a lot of single women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kid's head and keep food on the table and i don't know how these women are supposed to have	3127	A
time to to parent it's- it's i don't i don't know what the answer is to it it's it's really sad i there may not be i but it- it beats being it beats being homeless you know and	3127	A
right	3127	B
that's good well i try i try to as much as possible um my oldest is nine he plays plays soccer and is getting ready to start playing football	3127	B
and uh i'm behind him a hundred percent on that and	3127	B
and my my middle one is five he's playing soccer and T-ball	3127	B
my youngest is two and he wants to do it all so	3127	B
yeah- that's that's right	3127	B
that's true	3127	B
i try to be as much as i can	3127	B
oh no i i uh go out to as many games as i can get to	3127	B
it's kind of hard- hard hard with me just because_1 i'm in the restaurant business and i have to work weekends but my wife's there all the time and	3127	B
mean that's that's one of my that's my downfall on my side of that that that aspect	3127	B
which is i think's a lot of people's too	3127	B
just in general	3127	B
is that is there that- everybody's working you know the the dad's away at work and then the then the wife goes away to work and kids are stuck with sitters and they're not involved in there as much with their- their with their kids they let somebody else raise their kids	3127	B
what	3127	B
what do you what do you what difference do you see in those kids that than ones with a mother and father in the participation	3127	B
really	3127	B
acceptance	3127	B
right	3127	B
yeah	3127	B
wrong side of the fence	3127	B
right	3127	B
oh sure i mean the	3127	B
it	3127	B
that that's right	3127	B
right well you're fortunate that uh your kids are grown and i mean did did you did you work when your kids were growing up	3127	B
right	3127	B
right	3127	B
did you work in the school or in the administrative end of it	3127	B
it	3127	B
right just-	3127	B
did you work at the same school that your kid was going through	3127	B
right	3127	B
right	3127	B
right	3127	B
well it puts you it puts you in an awkward situation puts the child in an awkward situation	3127	B
right	3127	B
well they need to i mean any- any child as far as that goes there's that there's that certain there's that that fine line between A and C you know that you have you need to ride and all kids do they they need discipline	3127	B
right	3127	B
well that's usually what gets them_1 in trouble to begin with not enough attention- not enough attention like you were saying they go off into the wrong groups and get hooked up with the wrong people so	3127	B
you don't know if there is one	3127	B
there may not i mean it's just an ongoing- ongoing problem right	3127	B
yeah are you native to this area	3124	B
oh okay	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
yeah	3124	B
yeah it seemed like well you know last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in April and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until May	3124	B
kind of like pushed the season back a little farther and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity and it just tried to rain i mean i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago and it was trying to rain which	3124	B
seems strange to have it raining in July normally we don't have too much uh humidity or or uh rainy time when it's past June	3124	B
right	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
well yeah see i i lived in uh Ohio mainly i lived in uh Pontiac just a little while before i came down here and	3124	B
you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade	3124	B
you know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out	3124	B
you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do	3124	B
what part of Michigan were you living in	3124	B
okay yeah yeah	3124	B
what brought you down here	3124	B
uh so you teach in Plano schools	3124	B
oh okay	3124	B
okay	3124	B
well yeah i think a lot of people were uh leaving Michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus you know the the little joke about will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light	3124	B
well you know i i said i lived in uh the Pontiac i didn't live in the city of Pontiac i lived to the west of it uh	3124	B
i forget the the county but you know where all the lakes are around there	3124	B
i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes it was real close to where i worked it was only like four miles to work	3124	B
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that you know in the summer you feel like you're you know on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and everybody's you know out enjoying the water and such and	3124	B
uh in the winter time the lakes froze over you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes there's lots of really small ones out there	3124	B
you know like maybe a mile two long that's enough to uh do some boating and was lots of fun	3124	B
um	3124	B
uh-huh	3124	B
yeah yeah	3124	B
but it was yeah just lots of little lakes and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake but i just thought that was grand and i think a lot of people	3124	B
didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them but there was quite a few lakes all around there it seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where i was	3124	B
i said i wasn't close to downtown Pontiac i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from from the city limits and it was really nice out there	3124	B
we had uh Pine Knob you know to go skiing and stuff so there were things around there really was pretty nice	3124	B
right right in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope	3124	B
yeah yeah	3124	B
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3124	B
oh yeah yeah	3124	B
yeah yeah we used to have a Christmas time uh some of our relatives would come up from Alabama and i think most times we would have snow around Christmas and the kids when they were young would just go nuts	3124	B
you know because they were from Alabama where it never snowed and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally	3124	B
my first winter here i i came down in uh early eighty two and	3124	B
there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December before- couple days before Christmas it lasted only a few hours like by noon it was gone	3124	B
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow and i was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke ha ha	3124	B
they said no really there's snow and there was but a very short time and the weather got warm so quick just melted it all away	3124	B
course when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun	3124	B
yeah	3124	B
oh yeah i think it's fun even the couple of ice storms i've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit i mean	3124	B
sometimes the ice is pretty bad but if you get on the the uh grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you can you know not slip and fall i mean first	3124	B
well the weather has been certainly has been hot and it's been humid i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high	3124	A
for uh this late into uh well it's not really late into the summer but the the humidity has hung around all of June	3124	A
no i grew up in Michigan so uh but i've been i've been in Texas for fifteen years	3124	A
so uh but you know i know the summers get hot but it certainly uh this humidity has just really hung on there	3124	A
yes	3124	A
oh that's right that's right i can remember it not it's really August that it happens you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry and it just gets so dry and the earth opens up	3124	A
i can remember the first year i moved here and it didn't rain i moved here like in late August and it didn't rain	3124	A
from August until December and i went home and told them that it just doesn't rain in Texas i mean it was great after growing up in Michigan and not and all you know every day was cloudy almost every day was cloudy and i you	3124	A
you sort of forget how much it did rain and coming here and then it didn't rain it was just wonderful	3124	A
oh yeah	3124	A
that's right that's right	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
that's right oh	3124	A
oh i grew up in Dearborn	3124	A
which is a suburb of of Detroit you probably know where that is because i know where Pontiac is so uh	3124	A
anyway yeah oh a teaching job	3124	A
yeah i did i did for a while uh-huh so i'm home with home with two children so uh so new career	3124	A
new career but uh anyway so that kind of uh well i had been down here to visit so i finished school and said hey let's you know find a place that has a nice job and uh	3124	A
that's how it worked out	3124	A
oh yeah	3124	A
oh well it's a nice place you know i mean it's it's a nice that's a nice place though	3124	A
okay sort of	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
that's right that's right Lake i think Lake Whitmore is the only one i have real memories of	3124	A
which is	3124	A
well i think it's i think it's toward Ann Arbor so it's	3124	A
probably out that direction but that's the only one i probably could name after all these years so	3124	A
but uh	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
oh	3124	A
right right	3124	A
sure sure and don't- isn't that where they have a summer music festival there too	3124	A
uh	3124	A
that's right that's right i know we used to we we didn't do a lot of it but we did	3124	A
we did so those are always fun and Alpine was it Alpine was another ski slope that we went to so uh	3124	A
it was nice i always tell people	3124	A
that in the winter we use we used to uh my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on you know make a pond in the backyard for us	3124	A
so but uh you know we probably did some ice skating on it but then it chipped chipped and you know it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven but uh	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
oh	3124	A
oh oh right right if only it would make nice snow here in Texas we'd be okay at Christmas time	3124	A
yeah yeah	3124	A
yeah	3124	A
yeah yeah i know	3124	A
no that's not fun either so uh i i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets so	3124	A
but uh well we have our house is kind of on a little hill so uh we get the sled out and uh the kids go down the hill-	3124	A
the hill on the sleds when it's icy i mean they just go down the ice yeah if it's cold we say okay out you go i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there	3124	A
advice for people taking for parents uh help their their kids through college	3102	A
no i just graduated from college yes	3102	A
i went to Clarion	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my brother- older brother likewise	3102	A
and uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did so i think i would not push them towards any one place	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
yeah exactly	3102	A
i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school that's good for that	3102	A
well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could	3102	A
uh	3102	A
pardon me	3102	A
yeah i lived up at school yeah	3102	A
uh another reason was uh i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically you know	3102	A
you know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year	3102	A
yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself	3102	A
but uh then again i was there for school so	3102	A
uh	3102	A
and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind	3102	A
and i knew that Clarion was known you know for two things actually for their they are known as a teacher's school	3102	A
and also for their business so that's what i ended up going for is for business uh-huh	3102	A
no no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here	3102	A
uh Maryland uh-huh	3102	A
my fiancee is down there	3102	A
yeah he works for the government	3102	A
yeah	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
exactly	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
exactly yeah	3102	A
it does have a lot of bearing on it whether you're paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know	3102	A
uh yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted	3102	A
i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know	3102	A
uh they pretty much got to the point well well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up it's your fault it's not ours you know	3102	A
and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either	3102	A
but uh you know i	3102	A
i- i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it was- i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
yeah	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
oh wow that's really good	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know	3102	A
so i went and i just took business well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year	3102	A
and i am going into my third year and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore right	3102	A
and i thought oh my God i am paying for this myself i am not switching completely because i will put myself a year behind so i switched to finance and i liked it better	3102	A
and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year	3102	A
but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
exactly	3102	A
i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted	3102	A
but uh i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they're more focused	3102	A
they know exactly what they want to do	3102	A
uh-huh	3102	A
so uh let's see what- what was the topic i forgot oh oh we are supposed to talk	3102	B
yeah do you have any children	3102	B
oh did you where did you go	3102	B
Clarion	3102	B
huh uh	3102	B
would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah i know i- i kind of feel the same way i i just finished college a couple years ago and i uh	3102	B
you know it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but uh you know i went to a college that was fairly local and i feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it i think	3102	B
but you know i know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever	3102	B
i do not know i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something i do not know but	3102	B
but	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
is that why you picked the school you did or	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
so you lived there at school then	3102	B
you lived there at school	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
right	3102	B
uh-huh and that was for tuition and	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
for business	3102	B
so uh are you working somewhere then or	3102	B
oh i see where are you going to move to	3102	B
oh are you do you have friends there or	3102	B
oh i see	3102	B
so does he uh work for a company down there	3102	B
oh i see oh the big company	3102	B
so yeah i i've been working for TI for about twelve years i guess so	3102	B
but uh i'm not originally i'm originally from Illinois	3102	B
but you know i have gone to college i guess a few different places but i think you know most- for the most part	3102	B
you know the teachers have been pretty good and i've got out of it what i've what i put into it	3102	B
so	3102	B
but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but i think you know	3102	B
financially i'm there's only so much i can do for them_1 and i'll say you know here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but	3102	B
otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you	3102	B
but uh	3102	B
i do not know you know the financial end of it like you said i- i put my wife through school too of course TI paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but still was a challenge to do	3102	B
and uh	3102	B
so i think you know financially that's that's one of the big aspects	3102	B
you know you	3102	B
right	3102	B
yeah well did you uh since you were paid for school yourself did you- do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
right	3102	B
right	3102	B
uh-huh yeah	3102	B
yeah right	3102	B
yeah well see i think	3102	B
you know i've known a lot of people that would go to school and and their parents paid for it and i- i guess it depends on the way you were raised too but if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation	3102	B
you know i that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they weren't they didn't take it very serious i know i took it real serious because_1 i didn't start to college until you know	3102	B
i was about eight or ten years and uh you know out of what i should have been in school	3102	B
but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six	3102	B
yeah so i you know and that was hard cause i- i had two kids and you know a family and everything else so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time but	3102	B
yeah you are right exactly	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
right	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
right	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
right	3102	B
right well my- my wife was sort of in the same situation she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for	3102	B
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it	3102	B
but you know by then she had practically got her degree so so you know	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
uh-huh	3102	B
yeah	3102	B
yeah i think i think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man i really need this	3102	B
well what kind of pet do you have	3141	B
that's right	3141	B
Prissy get's you in trouble because you can't have them there	3141	B
and how many pets have you had	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
well you know we have a dog named Pumpkin so what we've had him	3141	B
a year and a half	3141	B
and uh it's okay i don't know i- i- i told my kids basically i would just not as i just soon not have a pet in the house but i give in	3141	B
yeah it's- it's it's hard for me i like pets a lot but i just don't like them in the house	3141	B
so i wished you know i wish we lived in an area where we had a big backyard i'd have a dog you know i'd have it outside but um i	3141	B
do they	3141	B
sure	3141	B
sure	3141	B
well it is easy and like Pumpkin is real easy i mean we don't even have to walk him much or anything he	3141	B
yeah yeah he goes out in the morning	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
well unless you got a doggy door you know like my my aunt and uncle have a doggy door and their dog just goes in and out at will	3141	B
so that that's nice	3141	B
all sealed up	3141	B
yeah i know that's that's the problem with it but um	3141	B
but basically dogs- our dogs worked out has worked out well and i think it's nice for the children i it's not my most favorite thing in the world but	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
right well they are loving i mean that's	3141	B
that's the thing uh you know my friend Barb i have a friend- good friend who's just moved here and she's gotten two cats and honestly she is just crazy about those cats	3141	B
and she's single lives by herself and they totally have kept her company you know i mean it is just it's really meant a lot to her to have those cats	3141	B
um-hum	3141	B
um-hum um-hum	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
yeah	3141	B
yeah it's really you know Barb said she wishes that she had done it years ago you know that she had um	3141	B
gotten an animal years ago because_1 she's been single a long time and you know she says it just makes a world of difference to come home and have them in the house	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
well i guess so you've had them_1 so you had them_1 just from early on then	3141	B
now were they indoor cats or outdoor cats	3141	B
right	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
uh-huh well now see we lived on a real busy intersection in Phoenix and we had a dog but he was killed we we couldn't it was it was not it just wasn't conducive to animals	3141	B
yeah it was it was very traumatic my sister- it was really upsetting to my little sister and and um so that- it just we didn't have many pets growing up just because_1 our house wasn't conducive to that	3141	B
and uh it just wasn't safe we didn't have a fence and our dog just got killed we'd keep him chained up but he got out and you know sure enough was hit by a car so	3141	B
oh	3141	B
yeah i bet	3141	B
right	3141	B
right	3141	B
uh-huh	3141	B
how old is Prissy	3141	B
um	3141	B
um-hum um-hum	3141	B
well uh you know it does that's just it and right now it's i do well to just take care of my children	3141	B
you know without taking care of an animal too so	3141	B
that's right	3141	B
that's right we just we just were on vacation and uh it was you know it was expensive plus i think you know for Pumpkin he didn't you know he didn't like it we were gone two weeks and that was hard on him to be boarded for two weeks and	3141	B
uh we can't talk about that can we we went to Gulf Gulf-	3141	B
Gulf Shores Alabama and New Orleans and so we had a really good time	3141	B
so but yeah Pumpkin was	3141	B
yes he did i always wonder i think well now how much do they remember you know like	3141	B
oh	3141	B
huh	3141	B
okay	3141	A
one very old fat cat Prissy and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house	3141	A
that's right	3141	A
she does shed a lot of fur	3141	A
she's we've had her for a long time we used to have a Spitz that kind of got deposited on us when a cousin was getting a divorce and we were supposed to keep her temporarily for about twelve years	3141	A
usually we've had dogs or cats	3141	A
yes	3141	A
yeah i'm reaching that point too	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
well i'm thinking of a next time about going back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair	3141	A
and i know there are a lot of dogs that are pretty clean and don't shed so Emily wants a dog a lot of her friends have little house mops kind of like yours	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
but do you have to let him outside for all his business and all yeah	3141	A
but see that's what would be hard for us since we're not there a lot	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
i think Jay would go bananas over that though he he likes for our house to be as secure as possible	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
that can be so therapeutic though when when i really want to just crawl into a shell i think uh wouldn't it be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
and i really i- i don't think i'm prejudiced since i've had both but i think cats are more prone to really have personalities i mean they own you rather than the other way around	3141	A
and i really do believe that i get a kick out of seeing my seventy seven year old aunt with her animals and she had a cat get killed	3141	A
like she always had	3141	A
and it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
growing up it was so funny because mother would always have a soft heart for strays and	3141	A
we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them_1 fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and	3141	A
i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them_1 that were going to be award winning type photos they've always been a part of my life	3141	A
oh yeah we had a Cocker Spaniel growing up but but the cats were the things that i loved and especially with being around kittens and the babies and all	3141	A
no no dad never- never would have allowed that	3141	A
so they always just kind of showed up and came and went and had babies and we played with them we we used them_1 as dolls sometimes we'd dress them_1 up and put them_1 in carriages as much as they'd tolerate it	3141	A
so it was always fun	3141	A
oh yeah	3141	A
that was traumatic wasn't it yeah	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
yeah that's exactly what happened with ours and my brother really took it	3141	A
hard because he was the one that had left the gate open so he blamed himself personally although you know there were so many things that could have been different but it was hard for him to cope with it being his fault	3141	A
so i do hate that i that's one reason i like cats and critters that can stay inside because_1 you don't face that	3141	A
-it's it's hard	3141	A
especially if you really do get attached to them_1 i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because_1 she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's going to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because_1 i think	3141	A
uh we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet	3141	A
she's at least thirteen or fourteen we don't know exactly because_1 we got her as a young kitten or a young cat and didn't know that much about her she's a neat cat i mean she owns us all the way	3141	A
but	3141	A
does require a little bit of work and housecleaning	3141	A
yeah yeah	3141	A
um-hum and you have the problem when you travel too we always we board her now and that gets kind of expensive	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
yeah	3141	A
um-hum	3141	A
where'd y'all go	3141	A
no i guess not it's not pet related	3141	A
oh boy yeah	3141	A
oh how neat	3141	A
but the puppy survived	3141	A
and you know my aunt says that they do drug them i just went bananas when she told me that that was a fact that she had shopped kennels	3141	A
and vets and that they all very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot and that just gave me the creeps because_1 i you know i hate to think they did that to anything or anybody	3141	A
but she said every vet's office and kennel if they would let it- if they	3141	A
so have you done any painting projects lately	3188	A
oh really	3188	A
what kind of painting was it	3188	A
uh-huh it was it	3188	A
yeah	3188	A
oh huh	3188	A
uh-huh	3188	A
oh well- what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends	3188	A
uh-huh	3188	A
so you can't use oil on wood	3188	A
oh so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway	3188	A
oh	3188	A
oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex	3188	A
hm	3188	A
uh-huh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center	3188	A
and uh and- the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff	3188	A
so uh she had that done but uh	3188	A
well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing uh that you keep some um farm equipment in	3188	A
and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer	3188	A
and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner	3188	A
but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so	3188	A
yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually	3188	A
well what about the trim in your house did you have to do that	3188	A
uh-huh	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
oh yeah	3188	A
did you have uh one coat or two	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
yeah that would be really time a a time saver	3188	A
um-hum oh me i would've had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then i'd have probably rolled it on i'd uh it would've taken me forever	3188	A
yeah well the first time it'd probably would've {tooken} me forever so	3188	A
well how long did it take y'all	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
so there was two of y'all	3188	A
well that's easy enough	3188	A
um	3188	A
i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it	3188	A
um-hum	3188	A
yeah this is a great topic for me because_1 i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal	3188	B
two little deals the first one um i helped someone repaint an apartment and it was very easy	3188	B
yeah and i've never painted anything- i always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it and the second one was i bought some toys at a um	3188	B
well it's uh it that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't it was a oil base so i had to get and when i painted them_1 i	3188	B
didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind	3188	B
well no you can use it on wood but i just had it all over my hands and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water you have to get the uh a solution	3188	B
and	3188	B
yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um	3188	B
uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just used- we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up	3188	B
yeah and and it it just like the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know it says safe for children and all that	3188	B
yeah	3188	B
have you painted anything recently	3188	B
wow was it huge	3188	B
uh-huh	3188	B
yeah	3188	B
wow	3188	B
yeah i think though um we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because_1 i don't know if i could you know i don't know i don't know must be difficult	3188	B
no it was just- it was really easy i just like what i we had a couple of different size brushes and it was-	3188	B
you know real easy i went around the trim and if it- and there was wallpaper like i was doing- just doing just the trim of the around the doors and windows and there was wallpaper and	3188	B
if we got it on the wallpaper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off so there was no major mistakes there was	3188	B
uh two actually um and it there was um you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that	3188	B
well yeah if you just you know we didn't tape anything we weren't that careful but it wasn't you know i don't know it's it's funny it's like if you just go slow you don't get or at least i didn't get that many	3188	B
mistakes i didn't make that many mistakes	3188	B
why just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it before-	3188	B
well it wasn't if it was my own i would've but my friend said oh just go ahead you just go ahead it's easy i said okay it's your place	3188	B
well a couple of weekends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and	3188	B
no there was they were doing all sorts of repairs and there was i was just painting because_1 i don't know how to do anything else so there's a whole bunch of people yeah	3188	B
so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else	3188	B
yeah	3188	B
but you know i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said oh get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true	3188	B
but i didn't realize what you know a pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex i don't know if it's worth the shine-	3188	B
hello	3106	A
this is Marilyn Spivey Richardson Texas	3106	A
i knew that was you well this should be a good one your mother will like it	3106	A
let's see now what do i do push	3106	A
push one okay hold on	3106	A
okay are you there	3106	A
well do you subscribe to any magazines	3106	A
which ones do you	3106	A
oh how many soap operas do you listen to	3106	A
oh and so you can keep up with when you miss with that	3106	A
um	3106	A
oh i see do you subscribe to any others	3106	A
oh	3106	A
now what do you find out in that because_1 i haven't read that one	3106	A
um-hum	3106	A
oh uh-huh	3106	A
okay well i only subscribe to two one of them is People magazine	3106	A
and uh that usually has the latest oh people in the world very interesting and then i subscribe i bet you know what this one's going to be	3106	A
to the National Enquirer because it's good light reading some of it i wouldn't believe but i but it's interesting reading and believe it or not there are a few interesting articles in it too	3106	A
um-hum	3106	A
well it's good light reading and since our business is at the house i when i'm eating lunch i like to read one or the other you know comes in the mail once a week and and that's what i read when i eat my lunch	3106	A
but i really don't read that many i never do buy them you know like when i'm at the grocery store magazines much i guess pretty much after that it's the newspaper and just books	3106	A
yeah i used to years ago read like Ladies Home Journal and McCall's and some of those but i	3106	A
i just kind of stick to these two now but uh you know because they come to i do subscribe and they come once a week so you know they're and i don't really have time to read anymore	3106	A
what- you mean the two that i subscribe- subscribe to	3106	A
uh oh well now i i guess i just pick out and read out of both of them what interests me there's an article about	3106	A
something way out in the National Enquirer or something i just you know i just don't read it i just read the ones that sound interesting to me usually about movie stars or famous people	3106	A
yeah now that that's true there is a lot of those i don't pay any i don't read those much either	3106	A
um-hum	3106	A
yeah uh uh although it's getting rather expensive since on the last time i had to	3106	A
i'll just buy the ones off the newsstand then once a month or something when there's something i'm especially interested in reading about you know	3106	A
yeah that's probably what we should do like they they do books that way you know so uh	3106	A
okay so does your mother still take People magazine	3106	A
cost measure huh we all have to have those every once in a while	3106	A
right	3106	A
yeah	3106	A
they're all so much more than they used to be years ago years ago i think people read a lot more magazines	3106	A
but uh	3106	A
well that's true-	3106	A
that's true	3106	A
yeah yeah	3106	A
uh-huh and and it's it's more as i can think more people do i think just read books	3106	A
so	3106	A
well let's see if you were going to subscribe to a magazine which one would you pick other than the ones that you are reading	3106	A
um-hum	3106	A
yeah	3106	A
um-hum	3106	A
yeah	3106	A
starting to save now	3106	A
hello	3106	B
uh Marilyn it's Angela	3106	B
how funny	3106	B
push one	3106	B
uh-huh	3106	B
yes	3106	B
uh Soap Opera Digest is one	3106	B
and	3106	B
uh just- two mainly	3106	B
yeah well it was a special thing it i think it was like a free subscription	3106	B
that you got to see if you'd like the magazine and you would renew it at the end of it i never did but	3106	B
but we take Consumer	3106	B
yeah i Consumer Digest	3106	B
now we do like that one	3106	B
it it has all different kinds of uh tips on on	3106	B
like appliances and TV's and VCR's and cars	3106	B
just different things that you buy and and what the latest items are out and stuff it it's real informative	3106	B
and then People magazine	3106	B
um-hum	3106	B
yeah i'd forgotten	3106	B
yeah they're i've i've bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i'll go ahead and buy it	3106	B
because sometimes like you said not all of it is believable and if you use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and what's not	3106	B
do	3106	B
yeah yeah i don't i don't buy	3106	B
i don't buy then at the store either i can't even remember the last time i bought one at the grocery store in a long time	3106	B
right	3106	B
what don't you like about the magazines	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
yeah i	3106	B
i don't like all the advertisements and some sometimes it seems like the magazines are full of more	3106	B
advertisements than they are anything else	3106	B
i don't either it's just you have to turn all those pages to get finally to the story you were reading	3106	B
when it's interrupted	3106	B
but i like People magazine too	3106	B
yeah it is getting real expensive	3106	B
yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to to do it and then everybody pass it through	3106	B
uh-huh	3106	B
uh-huh	3106	B
yeah well i think we're just going to do like you said just take the ones at the newsstand that that look interesting from now on because seventy five dollars for a magazine that's just that's too much that's	3106	B
yeah	3106	B
i don't think people have time to read them anymore	3106	B
it's just usually the newspapers and	3106	B
and then they're off doing their own thing	3106	B
weekends and stuff are pretty full and that's about the only time	3106	B
people seem to read on the weekends	3106	B
because mainly i i'm like you i read books	3106	B
more	3106	B
um-hum	3106	B
um	3106	B
i don't know i- i'm i just i don't i'm not that interested in the magazines it you know other than like People or this Consumer Digest and the reason why we got that one was	3106	B
you know it has good informative things in there for things your gonna be buying at one time or other and you can save them and it's got like tax tips in it and stuff like that	3106	B
maybe the the other one there's one out that's that has to do with with financial things like how to save money and and what bonds and {insurancers} and stuff like that to buy that we've got we had a	3106	B
sample subscription to that one and that one was was good too it had a the article- the one that that uh was a sample one had an article- article in there about college	3106	B
saving for your children and and what to do and what not to do and how much the uh uh projected cost was going to be by the time like you know mine reached college age and stuff	3106	B
and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting	3106	B
yeah yeah like those E-bonds there's something called an E-bond that you can buy and it and it you don't have to pay taxes on it and it's for the child and then when they turn it in when it matures-	3106	B
well what movie have you seen recently Valerie	3108	A
oh we haven't seen that one yet	3108	A
oh it wasn't that good hey	3108	A
oh well the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the City Slicker	3108	A
that was excellent it was just a really	3108	A
a really funny movie at the same time it had a	3108	A
story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion	3108	A
and but it was just entertaining- all around entertaining	3108	A
uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge	3108	A
oh uh it's i think it's less than two hours	3108	A
i know we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever	3108	A
yes but this one it was fairly long i i'm guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes maybe	3108	A
but excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby uh	3108	A
who was the oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy	3108	A
so we really enjoyed that	3108	A
yes i think that uh i can highly recommend that movie this to see	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
uh we generally rent a couple a week uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday	3108	A
they get they get taken up at the store so	3108	A
we will rent two or three movies on Thursday and uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good	3108	A
most of them are a coin flip	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
yeah well	3108	A
quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends and uh we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see and	3108	A
but	3108	A
uh	3108	A
uh generally we try to stay in the at least PG range the uh	3108	A
the oldest is nine the youngest is three he doesn't really pay attention and the five year old doesn't have the attention span either but the	3108	A
the nine year old will watch anything that's on TV	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
so	3108	A
yeah my wife took the uh i think the kids to see that one but	3108	A
we can generally find something at the store for them to watch	3108	A
the uh	3108	A
oh	3108	A
we saw this movie Presumed Innocent was the one we rented uh last weekend Harrison Ford	3108	A
it's uh he is a prosecuting attorney	3108	A
and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered	3108	A
and he's trying to find it and it's of course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her so it's and it's an extremely long movie it's over two hours long	3108	A
which uh my wife enjoy- she likes the suspense movies i enjoyed it to a degree	3108	A
save that for another day	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
yeah i think you it's uh it's something i think you would enjoy yes it's	3108	A
it it's like most suspense movies what was it was on TV recently um	3108	A
Fatal Attraction	3108	A
it's one that once you've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened so	3108	A
once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly	3108	A
at least i don't think so	3108	A
i don't know we've watched Weekend at Bernie's any number of times it's just slapstick comedy	3108	A
sit there and laugh and my one grandson and i my wife can't understand it but we like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure	3108	A
which is another funny one	3108	A
yeah	3108	A
yeah we like to laugh	3108	A
oh i i have a theory i like movies for entertainment i don't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie	3108	A
life's depressing enough	3108	A
well i've certainly enjoyed talking with you okay bye	3108	A
have- have a nice weekend okay bye	3108	A
let's see the last one we saw was Thelma and Louise	3108	B
well don't bother well oh from a woman's point of view and it was very uh	3108	B
chauvinistic as far as women go uh oh it was it was entertaining but um yeah i don't think the general audience would would go for it	3108	B
how was that	3108	B
that is one i've been dying to see	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh and	3108	B
how- how long did that movie run	3108	B
but i mean uh time wise how long was it two hour or	3108	B
uh-huh okay okay	3108	B
oh that always seems to happen when you rent them you know	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh and uh it	3108	B
was it oh good	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
oh great	3108	B
oh well i'm looking forward to seeing that one that was next on our list so uh	3108	B
okay okay good deal good deal do you rent movies very often or	3108	B
right right that's exactly right	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
better get yeah right right	3108	B
oh oh God yeah yeah and we usually have	3108	B
oh we don't get out as much as we'd like we have two children so we occasionally get out to the movies but uh	3108	B
it's it's fun it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
uh-huh and what ages are they have you found trouble finding movies for them or	3108	B
right	3108	B
yeah yeah	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
uh-oh uh-oh	3108	B
yeah they have been doing that we've been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see the last one they saw was Home Alone	3108	B
and uh they enjoyed that but uh i missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
yeah yeah well that's a good deal	3108	B
okay let me think if i have rented that one Harrison Ford and how does the story line go	3108	B
oh okay we haven't seen that one	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
oh gosh oh gosh	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
i think that's the one i wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me	3108	B
so i thought i better save that one for another day	3108	B
yeah because i think he'd like that one you enjoyed that one then	3108	B
uh-huh okay well that's a good one to put on the list	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
right okay	3108	B
uh-huh	3108	B
uh-huh okay	3108	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3108	B
yeah well yeah- i don't think too many of them_1 are anymore it's it's a shame but uh yeah	3108	B
oh no oh no oh	3108	B
oh gosh you know it- yeah we've heard about that one but we haven't seen that one either so well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies then	3108	B

it's kind of white and then we have a peach border and then there's um	3178	B
there's wall paper on the bottom part	3178	B
so	3178	B
have you done any	3178	B
actually it took a long time because_1 we had to rip off the wall paper first and then um	3178	B
wash down the	3178	B
um like there was all the sticky glue stuff on still	3178	B
just with water	3178	B
yeah but it took a long time to do that	3178	B
and then the painting took a while too so	3178	B
yeap	3178	B
we did	3178	B
what's that	3178	B
so you just got through painting your living room	3178	A
and what color did you paint it	3178	A
uh-huh	3178	A
hm that sounds neat	3178	A
so did y'all have any problems or or you know did it go pretty fast	3178	A
uh-huh how'd you get that off	3178	A
oh really	3178	A
uh-huh	3178	A
uh-huh did all of y'all get in there and get your hands dirty	3178	A
it what is it do you what do you usually paint the inside with enamel or latex or	3178	A
what what	3178	A
well now i i have a question for you do you like uh fresh water fishing or salt water fishing	3126	B
is that right	3126	B
oh you do okay	3126	B
oh where do you fish for striper there	3126	B
okay	3126	B
oh	3126	B
um-hum	3126	B
uh-huh pretty much	3126	B
okay so you're out in a boat then	3126	B
oh	3126	B
i've gone up there camping like at Eisenhower State Park and i've observed fishing but i've never actually fished there	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
so you like to go for striper then	3126	B
well the time i went and watched i went over to the uh to the dam and it was right after	3126	B
one of the major major rains that we'd had uh in fact i think it had been over the spillway recently when we went it was back down but uh some of the roadblocks were still up or there was evidence of them	3126	B
and people were they really had the gates open	3126	B
big time	3126	B
well i couldn't believe some of the striper that these people were pulling out and there were just people galore for that matter just just everywhere just huge fish	3126	B
so to speak	3126	B
all right	3126	B
deep in the channel huh	3126	B
i'll be	3126	B
oh wow	3126	B
right	3126	B
well i used to fish- go every summer to northern Canada	3126	B
and so i i've been spoiled by that uh but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row	3126	B
of uh sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through two thousand miles	3126	B
and uh we started out fishing out of a lodge and then we started uh either taking our own canoes or renting them	3126	B
when we got there and hitting a few of the	3126	B
you know smaller lakes along the river chain and uh catch Northern Pike and walleye primarily	3126	B
and sometimes Lake Trout also	3126	B
so we'd always go the first week in June you know essentially as soon as school was out and everything is all over and done we'd uh we go uh	3126	B
course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point he'd graduated from college and was in the Army and	3126	B
he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany	3126	B
and so i went with him in the middle of May and much to our surprise when we got there all the lakes were still frozen no yeah the first week we were there we just had to camp and	3126	B
uh we could go on the streams they were open up you know the flowing- where the water was flowing but the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole yeah whole first week we were there	3126	B
but then the next week they were just just like day and night difference we had some rain and wind and it it cleared all the lakes off and uh you know the fishing was already really picking up but uh	3126	B
those were my favorite fishing trips the most serious fishing i guess i've done	3126	B
oh	3126	B
good grief	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
wow	3126	B
right	3126	B
that's incredible	3126	B
boy	3126	B
oh boy	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
well i need to break my kids in they i have a son you know Wesley that enjoys it but he hasn't really caught enough fish to appreciate any fishing so i i'd like to break them in a little bit	3126	B
uh-oh	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
uh-huh	3126	B
right	3126	B
huh	3126	B
what do they use for bait	3126	B
yeah	3126	B
good grief	3126	B
yeah use the little ones for bait yeah why not	3126	B
oh me	3126	B
fourth of July yeah	3126	B
oh me	3126	B
i haven't really done any of that uh and oddly enough uh Jackie's parents live on the the Carolina- beach in North Carolina and and we've i guess we went out one time	3126	B
and just fished you know from the shore like in the winter you know one Christmas trip	3126	B
but other than that that's really been it yeah they uh i've always wanted to actually go out in the boat i think i went out on a a snapper party boat in the Gulf once upon a time but uh and i was i was too sick to	3126	B
okay	3126	A
i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i haven't been salt water fishing since i was about ten	3126	A
yeah and i do everything up at Lake Texoma oh yeah i'm a striper fisherman	3126	A
oh everywhere- wherever those little suckers are	3126	A
but uh we camp at the lodge Texoma State Park	3126	A
over on the Oklahoma side and uh but usually when we go striper fishing- when i go out for the big ones we travel down the you know where the channel is down the middle of the lake	3126	A
we usually chase them_1 down through there	3126	A
oh yeah oh yeah do you ever go up there	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
oh it's good fishing up there	3126	A
yeah of course i won't- you know i won't throw anything back	3126	A
oh yeah	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
oh my gosh that's supposed to be the greatest time to fish	3126	A
yeah	3126	A
oh yeah	3126	A
oh yeah	3126	A
it's fun- well my dad got me hooked on it	3126	A
and uh yeah oh God pun pun and uh we'd go out he liked to go out about five thirty and you know watch the sun come up every morning and uh boy we	3126	A
we knew a bunch of the striper guides and and so we'd follow them and he had a CB on the boat and all that kind of stuff and we'd just follow the channel and when it's you know	3126	A
middle July through late August when it's so hot they stay down real deep all the big ones do yeah follow that channel on up	3126	A
but uh so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then we usually fish under the bridge at night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that because where we go a lot of times	3126	A
uh the waves are so big i don't want my kids out there because_1 it's sort of dangerous but i love it i love it	3126	A
oh really	3126	A
oh	3126	A
oh how much fun	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
oh how much fun	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
oh you're kidding ooh not for me	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
oh my gosh	3126	A
ooh	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
yeah yeah when i take the kids out like i say we in fact Memorial Day weekend we went up to the lake and uh	3126	A
my cousins have a boat my boat is sitting in my driveway not running and uh so we go up there and we decided	3126	A
that we'd you know go out first- we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on let's go fishing we hauled in well we brought in	3126	A
thirty three fish and we had thrown a bunch of little ones back	3126	A
and uh so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun those kids	3126	A
they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones	3126	A
and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but	3126	A
Jamie's getting to the age now that when i get up and go fishing early in the morning he wants to go too you know he doesn't want to get left behind anymore	3126	A
so it's getting a little difficult to do that but	3126	A
we love it we just love it	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
well i have to watch it because Ashley'll out fish her brother half the time and so you know that gets a little sore	3126	A
but where we camp there there's a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk	3126	A
um down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up and they'll go down there while i'm cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they have more fun with that	3126	A
oh usually i'll buy them_1 a thing of worms or a lot of times i'll just give them_1 a piece of bacon and they're taught- they'll tear up bacon and stick it i mean those they'll they'll bite empty hooks that's what's so funny	3126	A
and when we're out chasing the big stripers we use those perch for bait	3126	A
yeah it's great	3126	A
but we just love it up there in fact Jamie wanted to go up this weekend with it being fourth of July weekend but uh i can't put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet i'm still pretty sore	3126	A
so anyway but	3126	A
have you been um salt water fishing	3126	A
right-	3126	A
oh my goodness	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
yeah	3126	A
uh-huh	3126	A
right-	3126	A
okay well originally i guess women were um	3163	A
in the house cooking and uh cleaning and all that good stuff	3163	A
oh yeah oh actually the children they they don't have as many children these days	3163	A
because they've gone out to work and they're um uh well the families of shrinking the divorce rate is up um they're	3163	A
still trying to get the pay that uh the men get	3163	A
um i guess even farther back um they uh used to not even have sports for the women	3163	A
and uh then the women starting wearing the tennis shoes and playing sports and going out to work um	3163	A
oh sure	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
uh-huh	3163	A
uh-huh	3163	A
yeah well it's kind of ironic they're also these days they're trying they're working their way back into the house	3163	A
and they're trying to have the best of both worlds	3163	A
and they're just now figuring out in the Nineties that it's not quite working	3163	A
and they can't have both	3163	A
so um i guess they'll have to make a choice	3163	A
right they'll just have to allocate that time	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
um	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
well i guess the men have definitely figured out that women are as smart	3163	A
there's a considerable amount more	3163	A
um there's a considerable more amount of doctors these days than there used to have been and of course you like you said they're more educated	3163	A
and um	3163	A
uh we've we've uh brought quite a bit to the world	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
well some women are actually leaving the husbands home with the kids	3163	A
and well i don't wanna talk about the husband's changing roles but they're all they're learning to cook now and to do the laundry and uh all of those good things	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
um-hum	3163	A
yeah it's no surprise that uh movies like Dances with Wolves have come out in the Nineties	3163	A
and their influence uh with the men	3163	A
and uh the changing of roles actually	3163	A
uh that was a very good example of women in the Nineties and	3163	A
what's a real man and a real woman you know they uh they do a little bit of both um the hard labor and uh	3163	A
you know the smart the uh all brawn and no brains on both sides	3163	A
okay well it was nice talking to you okay thank you bye	3163	A
taking care of children	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
well i- i was thinking too in terms of of in terms of this you know the education is so different i think women are so much better educated now than they used to be and i think that makes a big impact on what women do	3163	B
um also i was thinking the the clothing has changed so dramatically uh you know you- like when you said with sports i thought well it was so limiting because of their clothes	3163	B
they weren't allowed to to wear certain things and so then they couldn't participate- you know they couldn't participate in sports because of it so um i thought that's that's made a difference uh	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
right	3163	B
yeah	3163	B
well i think so or spend part of their lives doing one thing and part of their lives doing another you know it	3163	B
yeah uh because- you know because really it isn't that long a period of time that you have to be home with children uh comparatively speaking if you look look through your whole look at your whole life um	3163	B
and i do think there's real value in being in the home uh i do sort of both but um	3163	B
you know it it is it's an interesting topic i the thing that's been hard for me to believe too is that how long- how short a time it's been since the women had the vote and that's always been amazing to me	3163	B
that that's been a relatively short period of time and i think that made a major impact on women's roles uh you know from that point on	3163	B
i	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
well and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty to thirty years how that changes even more i think the impact will be felt more and more as as better educated women come into the work force	3163	B
um and more and more women come into the work force um	3163	B
i you know it it's going to just change things drastically i think	3163	B
that's right that's right	3163	B
well i think that you know that one of the things that may come out of this is to let people do what they're best at you know some people uh may men may stay home with children better than some women may and so whoever	3163	B
you know whoever does which role best i think should do it um	3163	B
if if people can compromise and do that kind of thing	3163	B
that- that takes a lot of	3163	B
uh-huh	3163	B
um-hum	3163	B
um-hum um-hum	3163	B
yes	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
that's right	3163	B
well i think that's all i have to say do you have anymore- nice talking to you thanks bye-bye	3163	B
well normally when we go on vacation we go home to Colorado	3190	B
really yeah Colorado Springs is where we're from	3190	B
how funny	3190	B
really we live up up uh Lake in the Broadmoor area	3190	B
where my family- my in-laws are	3190	B
oh	3190	B
uh-huh as you can't even ski there anymore	3190	B
yeah they closed it down	3190	B
uh-huh they don't have enough money to keep it going it doesn't doesn't pay so	3190	B
oh uh i'd like to go on vacation i can't- my husband and i wanna go to Florida to go to Disney World but we have two little ones that are under two right now so we wanna wait until they're a little bit older to do that and uh	3190	B
oh	3190	B
well how fun	3190	B
oh yeah oh i bet	3190	B
wow well that sounds pretty neat	3190	B
yeah that sounds pretty good and it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything	3190	B
really	3190	B
wow	3190	B
oh what a deal	3190	B
great-	3190	B
well that's great oh	3190	B
oh well we like to ski of course so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends because_1 we moved to Texas about two years ago	3190	B
so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do so we don't we don't get a lot of time to just vacation we did um last year though go to San Antonio for Memorial Day	3190	B
which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing	3190	B
uh but	3190	B
you know other other than that with with both my kids being under two it's real hard to do any any kind of	3190	B
events that that uh don't require babysitting	3190	B
yeah that's funny you should- funny you should mention that i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it	3190	B
uh-huh	3190	B
oh do you live where do you what state are you in	3190	B
oh you're in Texas	3190	B
so am i	3190	B
i'm in Garland yeah	3190	B
i talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day yeah so i guess they get people from all over yeah driving for Thanksgiving that's going to be quite a drive for	3190	B
uh-huh	3190	B
wow	3190	B
uh no Raton- uh oh well wait a minute yeah we do we do	3190	B
yeah um-hum and then we go straight up through Trinidad and straight up I-25 from there	3190	B
uh-huh	3190	B
oh	3190	B
uh-huh	3190	B
where have you been on a wonderful vacation	3190	A
oh that's where we go home too	3190	A
that's where we go	3190	A
yes my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maizeland yes	3190	A
ah	3190	A
oh we've been there we haven't skied at Broadmoor we went there last year at Christmas time and it was twenty seven below so we had to cancel our ski lessons	3190	A
really	3190	A
oh just this year	3190	A
oh my	3190	A
ah	3190	A
so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier	3190	A
uh-huh	3190	A
no	3190	A
uh-huh	3190	A
yes	3190	A
oh	3190	A
well we went on a family cruise last year on the Premier Family Cruise Line and then we went to Disney it was all part of the package	3190	A
and on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck and it was really oriented toward little kids	3190	A
so the kids could eat with Chip and Dale you know and you know it's just a lot of fun	3190	A
so then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney	3190	A
yes that was the way to travel	3190	A
yes	3190	A
yes that's right that's right and kids are really cheaper too	3190	A
we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available	3190	A
and we left a day early and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites	3190	A
so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin	3190	A
yeah	3190	A
so then our cruise was actually extended a day and our Disney was extended a day so we turned a seven day trip into ten	3190	A
and they paid for everything	3190	A
yes	3190	A
so that was a wonderful vacation	3190	A
yes	3190	A
well what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado	3190	A
yes	3190	A
yeah	3190	A
oh	3190	A
uh-huh	3190	A
right that would be	3190	A
yes	3190	A
i know i think one of the places i always hit in Colorado is that current outlet store	3190	A
that's what	3190	A
oh with the Santa Claus on the cover yes i've already ordered from that one but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year so	3190	A
Texas	3190	A
yes i'm in the Dallas area	3190	A
in Plano	3190	A
uh so that's not too far	3190	A
oh	3190	A
yes	3190	A
well it was when we left last year we left on the eighteenth right before that big snow storm hit Colorado and we pulled in just as it hit	3190	A
so how do you go do you go up through the Raton Pass	3190	A
when you go up there	3190	A
do you-	3190	A
that's on like Route 287 or something like that	3190	A
okay	3190	A
okay we uh went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U-Haul trailer because we had to take our dog in the car there was no room for luggage so we went all interstate we went up	3190	A
um through Oklahoma City	3190	A
and then up through uh Kansas and then turned left and went in on I-70	3190	A
and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour it was a little more mile wise	3190	A
but because you could go sixty five miles an hour on the	3190	A
okay uh well since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing	3168	A
uh i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and i feel	3168	A
i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and the such i'd feel much more comfortable than i do now based on what i've been hearing in the newspapers	3168	A
so i really don't have a problem with it	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
yeah	3168	A
yeah i well i happen to be uh my job is i'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company	3168	A
so i it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing and even in our field we have people that are in	3168	A
very high risk jobs and we at the present time do not have random testing and i am pushing towards that i- i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide	3168	A
they shouldn't have a problem with it	3168	A
and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because we're talking- we're talking	3168	A
major liabilities not only with themselves but with other employees	3168	A
and i really you know they they're talking about sports	3168	A
sports personalities and all this type of thing but i would much much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested	3168	A
on a random basis i- i have a real fear of that at some point something's going to happen and they're showing it with AIDS so why you know they should- they ought to start doing something with the drugs so i really have no problem with it	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
yes	3168	A
oh really	3168	A
well that scares me because if this- that's the way they are	3168	A
i if i were a dentist i'd wanna be protected too	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
right	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
well you where you're located i- i do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing	3168	A
and i think they've had it for several years and their program they had i don't think had a lot of uh problems	3168	A
associated with it but uh my brother-in-law happens to work there and it- it sounded very positive and i- i think it's great i- i would like i would encourage it i'm pushing our company towards that and also	3168	A
right	3168	A
exactly	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
right	3168	A
ours is changing yeah ours ours is changing it's increasing i live in a i live in a very nice suburb and it's it's it's unbelievable what what what's going on and	3168	A
the drugs the selling of drugs it's just it's just too loose it's too free	3168	A
um-hum	3168	A
really	3168	A
yeah uh i don't either i uh i've never worked- i don't work at home right now i stay home with my children um but my husband works and they do have that at at his place of employment and	3168	B
neither of us have a problem with it we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such it's uh it's a scary thing to know that uh you just don't know what people are doing uh before they go to work	3168	B
so and the the advertisements on television lately have been so um there've been so many you know there's uh	3168	B
just about like train train- train wrecks and things like that that i feel like probably just for our own safety and- when we're traveling and things that would be something i'd like to know that's going on	3168	B
um	3168	B
right	3168	B
um-hum	3168	B
yeah	3168	B
yeah well it's it's unfortunate i think that everyone doesn't have that opinion um some people just yeah i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that but uh	3168	B
in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the um the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know they feel that's not fair and whatever but	3168	B
you know those kind of things too i'd like to know myself it wouldn't be in my opinion i i've had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist i went to didn't even use gloves at all so	3168	B
that kind of yeah and uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me um but	3168	B
well you would think so that is because uh well and i worked for a dentist and that's uh you know you you come in contact with a lot of of blood and things like that and	3168	B
it's real real dangerous i- i would think but with all the accidents	3168	B
just with with uh everything happening just- airlines just drive me crazy people are afraid to fly now you know just because_1 they don't know what their pilot's been doing and and things like that and	3168	B
i don't know	3168	B
uh-huh	3168	B
well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs then they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support	3168	B
and- and whatever because a lot of people seems like would probably obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things and	3168	B
too many people are just dying particularly in our area i don't know what the crime is like where you are but the crime rate here is just astronomical	3168	B
um-hum i just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these i- i have two little very little children under two and i got a piece of paper from from my husband's office it's talking about these uh drug tattoos now	3168	B
that they have got that look like it looks like a sticker and it's for kids-	3168	B
okay i guess we're supposed to discuss the uh school system that shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us right	3134	A
right	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
that's really sad isn't it	3134	A
right well just recently in the paper here were articles about students um working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades	3134	A
but then the follow-up the next day was i was kind of glad to see because it it said that	3134	A
you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible	3134	A
you know and that it seemed to have more to do	3134	A
with other factors	3134	A
you know like what are their plans after high school you know and what's their home situation you know that	3134	A
right	3134	A
right	3134	A
right	3134	A
sure	3134	A
but there still can be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still	3134	A
you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my my first impulse- impulse was	3134	A
it isn't really what's wrong with the public public schools it's what's wrong with families	3134	A
and society in general	3134	A
right	3134	A
right	3134	A
right	3134	A
right	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
hm	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
well we've got um	3134	A
you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids	3134	A
and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor	3134	A
and that's just really not enough	3134	A
and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve	3134	A
help them to work through their problems while they're littler then they won't have as many problems up there	3134	A
really	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
um-hum they they do that here	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
to change yeah	3134	A
right	3134	A
yes it certainly is	3134	A
yeah that's right	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
right	3134	A
i'm on that um campus	3134	A
strategic planning committee for my school and um one of the	3134	A
uh you know oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best	3134	A
economic value	3134	A
then i think they decided to strike economic anyway	3134	A
you know the point was	3134	A
what happens when public education fails you know will then people go to private schools you know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if	3134	A
if most people are going to private schools	3134	A
right	3134	A
right	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
that's right that's right	3134	A
um-hum um-hum	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
yeah	3134	A
and one of the Plano school district's you know goal is that they will graduate every child that	3134	A
um that is here in the ninth grade i believe it's something like that it's worded and um	3134	A
i don't know	3134	A
right that's	3134	A
so important	3134	A
oh gosh well that new movie that new movie out i hm really really a frightening situation i guess we're both lucky	3134	A
to be in situations and schools where we don't see that my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother is was a teacher for years and years and um	3134	A
they live in Peoria Illinois and their talking a lot about the	3134	A
you know the school situation there too so	3134	A
well	3134	A
shall we wrap it up	3134	A
I think we have to so i'll see you when we see you	3134	A
um-hum	3134	A
oh	3134	A
oh how exciting oh that is wonderful what an experience	3134	A
no as many years as we've been involved in one i really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems they're not a lot of problems where i teach	3134	B
but from talking to people in other districts there are some major	3134	B
problems uh with dropouts um	3134	B
when i was in Minnesota last summer	3134	B
there was a teacher who said that uh on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city uh Minneapolis	3134	B
and uh they just didn't come to school and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school	3134	B
um-hum	3134	B
i think so too	3134	B
the home is the key i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um that- the main goal is making money now	3134	B
and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand so um right	3134	B
your education	3134	B
that's right it's what's wrong with families and if if children come to school	3134	B
yes insecure and their more- biggest concern is survival	3134	B
both at home they don't know what to expect at home they don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their	3134	B
apartment complex for example that child that was shot	3134	B
uh how can they concentrate on schooling i agree with you i think that's the main problem	3134	B
and school's now are supposed to solve	3134	B
social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security and that's overwhelming	3134	B
no it isn't	3134	B
true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and	3134	B
they divided them up between three counselors but	3134	B
for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work so they started uh dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees	3134	B
through you know through all three years of middle school and i think that	3134	B
would give them more security in going to the counselor if they have a rapport with their counselor now if they don't	3134	B
i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens	3134	B
but it is frightening but-	3134	B
because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another	3134	B
than what are we going to do with them what's going to happen to them are they going to be	3134	B
able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good	3134	B
uh-huh	3134	B
well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world	3134	B
where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone	3134	B
we're the only country in the world that does	3134	B
and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing you know to work and have uh some ability they can do that	3134	B
but you know if we can keep them in school	3134	B
then that that helps a lot i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too	3134	B
it's scary to me	3134	B
i	3134	B
we are	3134	B
um i would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary	3134	B
okay	3134	B
all right we were in uh Austin yesterday the reason that i was in the church	3134	B
and uh	3134	B
we went to hear uh James Win ensemble concert they left this morning for uh England	3134	B
isn't that wonderful	3134	B
uh-huh and uh the university	3134	B
well mostly um a a little fresh water fish but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because i used to live in Utah	3166	B
but um down here i haven't fished much in Texas	3166	B
oh they're really not i think they're good to eat	3166	B
oh just usually worms nightcrawlers sometimes fish eggs sometimes yeah	3166	B
just little just little fish eggs and um there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook and it will stay relatively well	3166	B
yeah and and they really like that	3166	B
now i have never caught catfish	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
oh is that right	3166	B
um now in Amarillo did you fish anytime	3166	B
um	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
uh-huh right	3166	B
oh how about_1 that	3166	B
oh	3166	B
oh i think that is really interesting	3166	B
um-hum	3166	B
i think the	3166	B
see and i wish i could go fishing here because i don't really know much about the fishing here i guess it would if you did it like you were just um saying	3166	B
that's pretty much like rainbow trout you bait the hook you throw it in	3166	B
you troll it a little bit and then you wait and then you troll it a little bit	3166	B
no i don't	3166	B
yeah	3166	B
oh uh-huh	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
huh	3166	B
you are now i've never used those that's really interesting	3166	B
yeah yeah	3166	B
um what kind of fish do you like the best to eat	3166	B
oh do you	3166	B
um	3166	B
yes i've done fishing like that but but uh tell me what um	3166	B
where you'd catch crappie my my neighbor has gone before and and done that but	3166	B
um oh oh i know uh they're sort of like well i want to say flies but not exactly like the	3166	B
yeah	3166	B
the yellow ones	3166	B
okay	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
uh-huh	3166	B
yeah my mom she just loves to fish and she has a lot of those those little um	3166	B
they almost look neon you know they're just real colored colorful things on her onto her ends yeah and she does- she's really a good fisherwoman	3166	B
yeah	3166	B
well you sound like you're a good fisherwoman too	3166	B
okay what kind of fishing do you do	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
that's one of the few things i've ever fished for is rainbow trout	3166	A
what what kind of bait do you use to catch them_1	3166	A
oh really fish eggs	3166	A
oh i didn't know that huh	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
oh i didn't know that's a great way	3166	A
i think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish also	3166	A
oh look catfish uh personally i like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best	3166	A
but a catfish a catfish will really just tear into anything like that like liver or uh cheese or anything that smells terrible	3166	A
um no actually i always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma and they have the uh Lake Texoma right next to them_1	3166	A
so the we used to catch some uh sand bass off Lake let's see- there's a Roosevelt Bridge and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom	3166	A
and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be sitting at different levels	3166	A
so yeah you just leave it at that level and in no time something would hit it and you could pull them_1 up two and three times in a row but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom	3166	A
and if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish	3166	A
and of course depending on how big your bait was um you know would be depending on what you caught	3166	A
yeah that was a lot of fun my grandfather used to do that and we used to have a light at the top of the water	3166	A
he really spoiled me in that respect	3166	A
um-hum	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
yeah well if you do you have any friends with ponds	3166	A
i um well if you can find- well oh even a lake if uh seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they wanna do is throw it out just as far as they can	3166	A
and uh bring it in to you but it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat you you wanna let- make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm	3166	A
and just have it come into the water like a a regular animal or or fish uh well you know something coming off from the bank like they usually do so you don't have to really get uh fish from a boat you know because they're actually right there at the shore	3166	A
yeah it just uh just a slow reel and then let it sit on the bottom but the key is to always have your line tight	3166	A
and that way you can feel when they're hitting it and believe me you'll know the difference	3166	A
oh crappie actually yeah i've been fishing in the the ocean we're about three hours from the ocean and i also like Spanish mackerel	3166	A
and you can catch blues and uh that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too have you ever fished off the pier	3166	A
uh-huh	3166	A
oh the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits	3166	A
and and jigs um they have like yellow um fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out	3166	A
yeah	3166	A
yeah get but they're a little heavier and they're bigger get the yellow ones those are the ticket and let them_1 drop to the bottom	3166	A
and maybe do a a kind of a slow reel you don't even have to have a good rod or anything just just even a regular line and you throw it out and uh the the other thing that's real good is small um	3166	A
it's a real small repala it's about an inch and a half long and they're pure silver- all silver something real shiny about that long	3166	A
they'll go after that in a heartbeat also just anything that really shines or spins	3166	A
oh yeah yeah that's it	3166	A
oh really that's neat	3166	A
oh	3166	A
i don't uh subscribe to any magazines at home because we get so many at work that um i need to read that um i just don't take any at home	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
uh-huh	3159	B
right	3159	B
right i used- i used to take McCalls and Good Housekeeping and um several magazines like that a few years ago at at at home	3159	B
but yeah the subscriptions ran out and i never renewed them and i found that i really didn't have time at home since i work to read them	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
uh-huh	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
right	3159	B
right uh-huh when i- when i had my magazines at home i would find that i kind of skim through them_1 and look at the pictures you know and if something caught my eye then i might read something but otherwise than that you know they were um	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
um-hum that's right that's right	3159	B
right	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
uh-huh	3159	B
right well since i work with computers	3159	B
during my work i have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything and i have to read the magazines you know such as Byte and Computer World and Mac World and all these	3159	B
um magazines such as that so i really	3159	B
you know just	3159	B
i can see that it will be a very long time probably before i subscribe to any magazines at home	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
right	3159	B
that's right	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
um-hum right if i if i go on an airplane ride or something i'll stop in and pick up a you know a Cosmopolitan or something to read on the airplane but um you know that's basically just about	3159	B
i buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
um-hum	3159	B
right	3159	B
okay	3159	B
it was nice to talk with you too	3159	B
thank you bye-bye	3159	B
okay do you subscribe to magazines yourself	3159	A
oh i see i get uh McCalls of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest	3159	A
and then once in a while i'll pick up a Working Woman or something and realize why i don't want to reenter- go back to work what i enjoy about staying home and uh i read magazines mainly because they're fast	3159	A
and if i wanna relax while i watch TV of course i'm one of those that does two things at once	3159	A
and uh i read Good Housekeeping and Better Homes and McCalls and i like them_1 because they're kind of short and to the subject	3159	A
uh-huh and then you stopped them_1 all	3159	A
i find that um about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular and then i kind of get turned off by it other than Good Housekeeping Good Housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for when um	3159	A
when i'm really have time and really wanna read something you know and i don't get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with uh on a general basis and	3159	A
we travel a lot so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various uh you know different ones	3159	A
and i get into uh newspapers so that- i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am i'm uh read- read it fast and put it down	3159	A
right	3159	A
well	3159	A
but uh that's mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this i	3159	A
i subscribe like i said to a few and once in a while i buy that new magazine called First on the newsstands or something like that but i kind of stay with my own subject matter of what	3159	A
uh pertains to my daily life at the present time	3159	A
right uh well sometimes if you know if you're in transportation in public transportation i know that people'll read them_1 on something like that	3159	A
i do that when we travel i always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we no matter what it is air travel or anything and i	3159	A
right although- although now	3159	A
uh reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it and it was just above my head without having someone there to	3159	A
give me the advice as i went along it was you know kind of a little bit more than what i needed so i never did get into them i	3159	A
when i bought the computer all of a sudden i was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail i think they all said thought well we have a live one she'll subscribe but they were wrong i never got into them but uh okay	3159	A
all right i guess we might as well end our conversation at this point it was nice talking with you okay um-hum bye now	3159	A
uh well	3123	B
where i live in Plano one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their school system	3123	B
and uh in fact i think that there's some areas of of Dallas and Richardson that are in the those city- town city limits but they uh	3123	B
all of the the housing developments adjoining Plano are in the Plano school district and they use that as one of the things that they	3123	B
uh you know that they try to market when they sell homes in that area the fact that it is in Plano schools	3123	B
uh i do have children in that school system uh	3123	B
and have been personally pleased with that uh i'm not sure that it's that that there's that much glory in the Plano schools versus say Richardson and some of the other areas	3123	B
uh	3123	B
uh	3123	B
probably the biggest controversy within our school system	3123	B
is the use of the open classroom concept	3123	B
uh where uh	3123	B
all uh all the students at a given grade level are in one large area for much of the day uh segregated you know by teacher but not necessarily having walls between the classrooms	3123	B
uh i've now had two children that are have been in the system- in the system	3123	B
uh one who seemed to do just fine in that tap type of atmosphere the other i'm not so sure about because of uh his attention span i think he's a little bit more easily distracted than was she	3123	B
and that seems to be the primary complaint uh	3123	B
i think my biggest complaint- problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their classroom to eat	3123	B
uh rather than giving them a a break from that area during the day	3123	B
uh and	3123	B
uh	3123	B
that's i guess i'm a fairly satisfied uh parent as far as the school system goes myself uh	3123	B
that	3123	B
that it really boils down to the quality of the teachers	3123	B
uh and their interest uh in the students individually is going to make the difference versus you know physical things such as the open classroom versus a more closed classroom	3123	B
uh what do you see as problems	3123	B
yeah	3123	B
right	3123	B
uh-huh	3123	B
right	3123	B
now in in Dallas i know at least at some of the later grade levels they have these magnet schools that i think were initially set up to address the segregation issues	3123	B
uh and i wondered uh what the real overall effect on education is of those uh i know i have a niece in the Dallas system that	3123	B
is a uh was just elected to go or selected whatever i i think you have to apply and be accepted to these magnet schools but she's interested in the arts and in in particular in dance	3123	B
uh they call it a magnet school where it attracts kids of certain interest	3123	B
and uh she will be attending i think Skyline Arts Magnet uh or arts and	3123	B
something magnet school uh next year when she enters high school	3123	B
yeah	3123	B
uh-huh	3123	B
now i would think that would would be a good point as well	3123	B
they they don't have that type of thing in Plano they just have these two gargantuan high schools	3123	B
uh but i do think they do provide some type of special interest focus i think the later years uh for for students	3123	B
well	3123	B
oh not really uh i've not been that aware of it	3123	B
uh i live on it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano with Central Expressway down the middle	3123	B
uh and i am on the west side but just barely on the west side i guess my kids are younger than that	3123	B
and in they're in the non competitive uh just athletics uh organizations you know your typical soccer and baseball and all that sort of stuff	3123	B
and because of where we live uh the teams that my son has been on has have been from both sides of the fence if you will	3123	B
they've drawn from both sides and i really haven't sensed any of that yet i it may become more obvious to me in later on	3123	B
i think the one of the more interesting things in Plano is that they have high schools and senior high schools	3123	B
which a lot of people don't realize that	3123	B
that ninth and tenth grade go to high schools of which there there are quite a few in Plano and the senior high schools are only the eleventh and twelfth grade	3123	B
yeah that's was very different uh they have middle school sixth seventh and eighth	3123	B
and then they'll have uh fact they have a couple of huge schools that are actually almost all	3123	B
middle school and elementary school all of those grades in one building	3123	B
but uh	3123	B
for the most part	3123	B
yeah bunch of elementary and they typically feed certain middle schools for sixth seventh and eighth and then there a number at least i could probably think of six	3123	B
high schools	3123	B
Shepton is a high school	3123	B
ninth and tenth	3123	B
and uh there's Shepton and Vines and Wilson or Williams and there's Clark and	3123	B
i don't know whether there's more than four i want to say that there are more than just four but uh it's just ninth and tenth grade and then the the two senior high schools are just eleventh and twelfth graders	3123	B
which is a sort of a different concept	3123	B
and they're they're just so big i'm a little bothered by that uh just the sheer-	3123	B
okay what do you think about the school systems	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
right	3123	A
okay	3123	A
what do you see as being a problem with the school system	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
oh	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
yeah	3123	A
well i don't have children in school and it's been so long since i was in school myself i'm not really sure how to answer that	3123	A
when uh i don't know it seems that they're you know that that the difference is between each school i think if it was	3123	A
if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing	3123	A
uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is	3123	A
you know you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a if if it's the the teacher that's got the problem or if it's the book that's got the problem you know what the materials that they're using and everything	3123	A
that could be causing a problem	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
what kind of school is that	3123	A
oh okay	3123	A
yeah i think that's kind of a good idea because	3123	A
you know it doesn't it doesn't	3123	A
it doesn't divide people by	3123	A
by anything besides what they're interests are	3123	A
and it's a much- higher- it's a learning environment if you're group- if you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are interested in sciences	3123	A
it seems like it would it would uh it would help	3123	A
yeah	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
okay	3123	A
what do you think about about sports in high school and about uh the competitiveness	3123	A
i've i've know i've seen in Plano that there's a lot of really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high schools	3123	A
and do you think that's healthy	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
yeah	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
oh yeah	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
oh okay	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
uh-huh	3123	A
now i didn't even realize that at all	3123	A
um	3123	A
right	3123	A
huh	3123	A
well i know they've got a lot of elementary schools	3123	A
well now what is Shepton going to be	3123	A
okay	3123	A
okay	3123	A
um	3123	A
yeah that does seem kind of different	3123	A
i think our next car i would like something like a an economy car that gets really good mileage and um one that's really reliable i would	3173	B
i think probably not an a brand new car but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra or something like that um something my husband can	3173	B
oh absolutely air- air conditioning and a radio uh AM FM and a cassette player and um	3173	B
what else do i want	3173	B
um i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice you know a a navy blue or a	3173	B
yeah that's what it would be for is for him to drive	3173	B
back and forth to work	3173	B
i think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic	3173	B
i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that um you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed	3173	B
uh probably- well probably probably that would be a good idea	3173	B
yeah	3173	B
that's right so if we wanted it to take people out with it that's a good thought i	3173	B
that hadn't crossed my mind	3173	B
yes i would go for that	3173	B
well thank you for calling	3173	B
all right good-bye	3173	B
all right why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next	3173	A
um-hum	3173	A
and of course it has to have air conditioning	3173	A
does it have to be a special color	3173	A
it sounds like something your husband would drive right	3173	A
yeah well i don't think we're looking for another car right now because_1 we just bought one but when we were looking we were looking for something had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air conditioning and	3173	A
a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so	3173	A
yeah	3173	A
um-hum would you like four doors or it doesn't really matter	3173	A
hm yeah it it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes so	3173	A
it be fun just to win one wouldn't it that would be great {alrighty} well i- i think that's all that we need to say	3173	A
all right we'll talk to you later bye bye	3173	A
the budget seems to be	3172	A
oh on a number of people's minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didn't spend money here and there i hear them_1 talk about uh cutting	3172	A
what they call aid to some foreign countries and people don't understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and	3172	A
and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh you- start giving a country uh	3172	A
x amount of dollars for so many years and their whole economy and their whole	3172	A
uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever	3172	A
you wish you know you would say well you're not acting right we're gonna withhold it or you're not doing this that or the other or we want our base here or we want whatever	3172	A
and the government's been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and i'm not sure if the general public uh	3172	A
thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little	3172	A
far fetched and not necessarily for the common good	3172	A
uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few	3172	A
and usually those who are um	3172	A
rich anyway or have enough- have enough money to attend those kind of functions	3172	A
so it's that's a a controversy of course there's only a hundred and seventy million going to the NEA but a hundred and seventy million's	3172	A
a bit and it's something so	3172	A
what would you do or cut or change in the budget	3172	A
um-hum	3172	A
right	3172	A
um-hum	3172	A
um-hum	3172	A
most of the the national or the federal dollars that go toward any project	3172	A
uh people tend to want accountability but they don't want the so-called bigger government so they they wanna have fewer government employee	3172	A
well	3172	B
um i agree with you on the international aid and um	3172	B
i don't think a lot of people realize too on we can't live isolated our world is such an international economy now and um	3172	B
uh especially with the problems in Eastern Europe and Russia	3172	B
uh	3172	B
i know a lot of people feel that we've given so much aid and we have so many economic problems and and i agree that we do but um it's also in our country's interest um	3172	B
to have a balanced world economy um sometimes it does seem like we're the ones doing all the giving um and i have to admit sometimes i have wondered if uh	3172	B
we run into problems which is is certainly a possibility if anyone would come to lend us a hand but um	3172	B
i do think uh	3172	B
this is a hard area i'm there's some areas that i feel uh	3172	B
need a lot of work um and improvement and education comes to mind i know they are working on trimming defense um	3172	B
this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that we're in	3172	B
but unless they start working on it um	3172	B
it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable	3172	B
but i'm not sure exactly what practical	3172	B
uh steps	3172	B
uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um	3172	B
i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits	3172	B
the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the	3172	B
federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think that's our future if we	3172	B
um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um	3172	B
some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um	3172	B
it's that's an area i would not want cut	3172	B
there are a lot of areas i think that money could be better spent i think sometimes the money they spend on studies to decide on things is way out of proportion and and of course everyone's heard the stories of the	3172	B
several thousand dollar hammer and um you know somewhere along the line um	3172	B
there've been some	3172	B
gross errors	3172	B
well Hal what's uh what's crime like in Dallas	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
oh yeah yeah in Baltimore we have similar	3111	B
uh i live on the outskirts of Baltimore and uh we live right outside the city	3111	B
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though i'm in graduate school uh i live here because it's close to the university but you know we have uh it it's really funny the only crime we really see	3111	B
is uh just the kids being malicious	3111	B
you know and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around that make sense	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
yeah something like that no one's you know or or fathers are just missing you know so there's no uh	3111	B
no consistency there in the home or whatever there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong you know	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
um-hum	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
yeah i think that's we're about the same in Baltimore though um Washington i think is uh	3111	B
close by and you know they experience a lot more i think they definitely have more problems that uh	3111	B
uh in in the area what what do you think can prevent crime	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
yeah i think	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah i i i think i agree with you there	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh yeah i think they the drug culture definitely has uh is one of the main problems yeah our uh our mayor in uh Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should	3111	B
uh legalize drugs	3111	B
because it would eliminate the uh the violence	3111	B
and the uh the under	3111	B
uh the the market i guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it that make sense he's one of the big proponents of that he gets on national television and and says that you know so it's um	3111	B
and he was a	3111	B
uh District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor so that's a really stranger- you know it's a different viewpoint i uh	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
what happens if we lose worse	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
right	3111	B
um-hum	3111	B
right yeah	3111	B
yeah they have induced it themselves yeah that's true	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh well i think you know they did that in Alaska	3111	B
that that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana	3111	B
but i- i never i never heard results or anything like that so i never you know plus that's such a that's not a true um	3111	B
you know it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country	3111	B
you know so that but that was interesting you know i i don't crime is one of those things that's uh	3111	B
i i don't know you know the drug culture the uh	3111	B
the um	3111	B
you know i i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah that's true that's true we worked hard for everything that's very true	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
right	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah	3111	B
yeah that i think that uh the drunk driving has just actually just caught on uh uh and i i i really uh my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school and um	3111	B
that was a very uh	3111	B
that that was an awful three years afterwards you know of recovery and the difficulties	3111	B
and uh everything we did and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago there was no his father was even the uh police chief of the town	3111	B
so there was no repercussion at all	3111	B
you know other than insurance but he was uninsured	3111	B
so uh our insurance paid for everything but it was a very difficult time and and then later this was actually funny my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it	3111	B
and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere and they came and questioned us	3111	B
you know and	3111	B
right	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yep	3111	B
uh-huh	3111	B
yeah very much so yeah that those are some important points	3111	B
yeah i that's	3111	B
those are	3111	B
well see Maryland is one of the most we just voted in uh gun control strong gun control here in the state of Maryland i i think	3111	B
well it depends where in Dallas you are there are certainly parts of town	3111	A
i would not want to live in	3111	A
because it's a situation it is very location dependent	3111	A
and there are parts of town here where	3111	A
when they talk about the nightly gunfire	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
yeah that uh the what they call the latchkey children	3111	A
you know the suburb i'm in is more of the upper middle class so i think our uh not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems but on the other hand	3111	A
uh we get the uh affect of the	3111	A
uh the city and	3111	A
uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes	3111	A
a small number of assaults	3111	A
uh well if we have one murder a year that's probably	3111	A
as many but then you know you go into Dallas and they are unfortunately	3111	A
uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
well uh the thing is i don't it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are	3111	A
inverse of what they should be like uh	3111	A
wherever there are more	3111	A
uh criminals there are more policemen but that's which came first	3111	A
but on the other side of it is it's it's basically the the problem is within the in the society and the society's views	3111	A
and uh well um since now i'm in my mid forties when i was in grad school	3111	A
or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought you know crime was was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the	3111	A
the drug aspect of uh	3111	A
uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts	3111	A
um	3111	A
because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that	3111	A
uh i even had to worry about but i think you know that	3111	A
there is a lot in the society where things have changed	3111	A
uh so it's effected all of us	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
you know in a sense i don't i'm not- i have real mixed feelings on that because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh	3111	A
uh	3111	A
it would certainly be an interesting test	3111	A
but the other side of it to me	3111	A
uh you- well the other side is that unfortunately	3111	A
some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life	3111	A
uh	3111	A
society didn't try to then save themselves from it they let this person	3111	A
who had ruined it	3111	A
uh become well die or whatever i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that	3111	A
their life expectancy was real short but now we tend to	3111	A
believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have	3111	A
you know physically ruined themselves	3111	A
yeah and so to me that's i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them	3111	A
uh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
yeah well the- some of that and of course i'm a baby of the old school but it it bothers me from the fifties on not that i'd remember that much from the fifties but but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality	3111	A
and so you know in the there were the sixty four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties but nowadays there's so much on TV where	3111	A
where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing of course	3111	A
uh i work with lawyers a lot and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody	3111	A
and you know there's a million dollars you can have	3111	A
uh for mental duress or whatever	3111	A
but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in Europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that people are	3111	A
well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable	3111	A
and yeah if you're going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is	3111	A
we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds	3111	A
the punishment is	3111	A
extreme and we mean it	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
yeah	3111	A
uh-huh	3111	A
yeah	3111	A
but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving	3111	A
was uh misplaced for years that you know	3111	A
it was an acceptable social behavior	3111	A
what are what does your city have for gun control if anything	3111	A
hello	3196	B
hello	3196	B
oh well i'm glad you found me	3196	B
yes my name is Carolyn	3196	B
okay i'll just let you start	3196	B
i think they are too and unfortunately um	3196	B
we use ours in we don't use them_1 all the time but we use them_1 like at Christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them_1	3196	B
like that but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them_1 in half	3196	B
i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them_1	3196	B
um that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think	3196	B
when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really	3196	B
get a lot more stuff	3196	B
if you were just able to pay outright for it	3196	B
that's right	3196	B
yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like um	3196	B
we have a Sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well that's	3196	B
probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on	3196	B
at that point and then it seems like	3196	B
takes forever to pay that off	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
wow	3196	B
it sure is	3196	B
we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards	3196	B
and the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was you know to just have that	3196	B
we haven't done it lately we probably need to do it again	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
oh no	3196	B
oh	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car	3196	B
and uh if you could stick to that you know we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and everything else	3196	B
oh dear	3196	B
um-hum	3196	B
you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though it's just like keep	3196	B
hello hello hi boy it took forever to find somebody	3196	A
good well i'm my name's Gail and i guess we have to talk about credit cards	3196	A
okay well if you're ready then uh	3196	A
i'll	3196	A
okay i'll press one	3196	A
okay well i'm not this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall	3196	A
i just find it so easy to to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it and really trying to get out of that habit so	3196	A
i think they're kind of dangerous	3196	A
um-hum	3196	A
yeah me too	3196	A
um-hum	3196	A
yeah that's true that's true seems just like our society is so um	3196	A
pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this they're really trying to get you into that uh situation because_1 they know they've really got you then	3196	A
so	3196	A
uh-huh	3196	A
uh-huh	3196	A
it's funny that uh we've got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago	3196	A
and we still owe i mean i- i think like half of the amount that they cost in the first place	3196	A
it's just uh you know you just never never get get it out	3196	A
and uh that's that's real irritating to have	3196	A
uh-huh	3196	A
well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed	3196	A
for the truck and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills	3196	A
and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and it's gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them_1 you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time	3196	A
uh until several months later that	3196	A
we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were	3196	A
pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them_1 and so we charged them_1 all up again	3196	A
yeah so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem so we were paying like twice	3196	A
um so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily but uh we're	3196	A
definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that i just it's so	3196	A
so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes	3196	A
um-hum	3196	A
yeah	3196	A
yeah	3196	A
yep	3196	A
sure that's true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over her yeah what a mess you are	3196	A
oh so i don't know if i if i- i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and i just thought	3196	A
you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and	3196	A
so he said okay we'll keep it and then we weren't smart enough to not use it so	3196	A
now we just don't	3196	A
hi Clarice um	3189	B
have you had a family reunion recently	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B

uh-huh	3189	B
oh how nice	3189	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3189	B

wow wow	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
oh that's wonderful oh	3189	B
now how many how many people are in his immediate family	3189	B
oh wow	3189	B
wow it really is and you get together once a year wow uh	3189	B
are they all here in the area or are they scattered	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3189	B
oh wow that's wonderful that's wonderful	3189	B
well we don't really get together i i would love to and that's why i checked that i wanted to do that because_1 i would love to plan a family reunion sometime um i have a sister in Colorado and	3189	B
uh a sister in upstate New York and a sister in Connecticut and here i am in Texas so we're kind of scattered right now	3189	B
and um my my cousins have a you know they put on a family reunion um once a year but it's always like the second week in September so it's the kids are already back in school	3189	B
and so and that's back in and that's in New York and there's no way i mean there's just no possible way and it's not really a weekend it's just like a day kind of thing because_1 most of them are still- you know um	3189	B
my family moved to Connecticut the rest of the family stayed in New York and uh on Long Island and so they're all kind of local and close and so they just have a you know a day picnic	3189	B
and uh i've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing	3189	B
that would be so wonderful	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
oh wow	3189	B
yeah yeah yeah	3189	B
and do they they have a hotel or where do you stay	3189	B
take everybody yeah	3189	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3189	B
yeah yeah oh that sounds so wonderful isn't that nice	3189	B
yeah	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
from one brother and sister from each family	3189	B
uh-huh	3189	B
oh wow uh-huh	3189	B
um-hum	3189	B
oh i see uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh wow	3189	B
yes just this last summer we went back to Utah and we met it was my we usually go to my family reunion but this one was my husband's	3189	A
and they're usually quite similar i think	3189	A
no he's from here	3189	A
but um most of his people are from Oregon so we kind of met halfway	3189	A
and so this was one and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and and had you know things like that have to be planned like they had planned that	3189	A
we went to the reunion in end of July- June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend but we had to plan everything like clear in December January to reserve that	3189	A
um-hum	3189	A
no this was everybody	3189	A
oh i oh uh jeez i think over um three hundred were there it was quite a large	3189	A
it was a great big lodge and so we had plenty of room and everything and and some of them live in that area so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave but um	3189	A
that was a great big thing and we do that with his family about every	3189	A
five years a great big one and then like immediate family we do like uh we try to do one thing once a year	3189	A
well he has eight brothers and sisters so that's big by itself	3189	A
yeah so we have a little shindig with them	3189	A
uh they're close in a close proximity um	3189	A
uh let's see there are four of them who live here in Texas and his mom and dad	3189	A
so um the others live in close neighboring um states like Nevada Arizona i think like that and	3189	A
yeah so it's been fun how about_1 you	3189	A
um-hum	3189	A
um-hum that's hard	3189	A
yeah yeah	3189	A
um-hum	3189	A
yeah	3189	A
it really is fun and my mom's family does it once a year just like you said once a year um they have a a	3189	A
a Wednesday through a a Saturday type thing you can come and go as you please type thing and they do that once a year i kind of missed it	3189	A
this year and felt bad but you can't go every year you just cannot do that um	3189	A
um basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters there are enough in the area to	3189	A
to just kind of span yourself out um whoever's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them like i go stay with my mother and	3189	A
my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad you know kind of thing and so it's not hard	3189	A
in in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area so that's not hard but	3189	A
the real planning that's the real key and they send out my mom's family now this is the first reunion with my husband's family i've really been involved with	3189	A
but my mom's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year and that's how they divide it up and then	3189	A
uh she has ten in that family and each one of them take their turn and then the the parent whose turn it is the child whose	3189	A
turn it is her children help her like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing yeah and um the thing is that um	3189	A
the the real part is there are two mailings that go out and the first one is to just kind of give a an approximate date and time so you can start getting	3189	A
okay	3120	B
well did you go to college	3120	B
and where did you go	3120	B
uh-huh	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
well i went to the University of Minnesota	3120	B
i am uh-huh where do you live now	3120	B
well i'm in Texas i'm in Austin	3120	B
uh-huh	3120	B
i'm familiar with Plano i visited once or twice	3120	B
oh i love it i love it i really do	3120	B
that's correct i have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore	3120	B
she has her heart set on U T	3120	B
and um you know having gone to the University of Minnesota	3120	B
i know what a big university is like and um	3120	B
one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters	3120	B
is my youngest daughter got involved in band and Baylor has a band camp	3120	B
so she went for a week and it was overnight and they lived in the dorms	3120	B
and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's you know like on a college- a smaller college campus	3120	B
and um my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school	3120	B
so um	3120	B
i i i still think the exposure was good	3120	B
the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know what were your selection criteria did you base it	3120	B
on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know there's all of these	3120	B
areas to look at in making the decision	3120	B
oh wow	3120	B
oh definitely	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
oh how exciting	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
oh that was a that worked out very well for you	3120	B
well then he should come to U T	3120	B
um-hum	3120	B
large classes	3120	B
oh i went from a large high school to a university- large university and i definitely felt like i was a number um i mean	3120	B
it is a different feeling but that was that was my only option	3120	B
i i mean i just really couldn't look at anything else that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior- you know a junior college which i didn't want to do	3120	B
so that's how you know my decision was made but um	3120	B
yes	3120	B
what what does he hopes to be a writer	3120	B
huh	3120	B
oh she she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions um	3120	B
what she talks about a lot is theater which i think is okay Bethany let's be real um	3120	B
she really is is pretty unfocused at this point	3120	B
and i don't know she's taken a lot of French	3120	B
and she may end up doing something with that	3120	B
and i am a single mom so	3120	B
i've been and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married so i'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake	3120	B
and i'm you know showing them if you're strong in math and science {kiddos}	3120	B
this is one area where women can make some decent money	3120	B
you know i mean i'm kind of really putting the practical	3120	B
application you know and and saying yet do something that you enjoy	3120	B
by all means go get that piece of paper you know do you just have one son	3120	B
i see	3120	B
well it sounds like he's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do	3120	B
okay	3120	A
yes i did	3120	A
i went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia	3120	A
um it was Sweeper College it was- about seven hundred and fifty students i had	3120	A
gone to a small	3120	A
school growing up uh	3120	A
and a lot of my friends went	3120	A
to university -University of Michigan but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when i graduated and	3120	A
um were looking for a southern school and	3120	A
um also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and	3120	A
um	3120	A
what about you	3120	A
oh so you're from the Midwest too	3120	A
um i live in Texas now where are you	3120	A
oh um my brother's in Austin	3120	A
um he lives in Lakeway he um had moved uh we're in Plano	3120	A
and	3120	A
oh Austin is so pretty i really like it	3120	A
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore	3120	A
is um because you live in Austin is she thinking about the University of Texas	3120	A
oh	3120	A
yes	3120	A
um yeah those um and those were several uh	3120	A
that we did consider um my parents	3120	A
uh um certainly didn't push but	3120	A
wanted me to look in the south and because i had been in a small school	3120	A
they suggested that i probably i when i say small my graduating class had eighteen in it	3120	A
and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one	3120	A
um or small group situations and	3120	A
i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in	3120	A
biology and i also wanted to spend	3120	A
one year studying in Europe um i had had an A F S student	3120	A
from Germany live with us our senior year	3120	A
i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and	3120	A
i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department	3120	A
they also had a strong language department and i'd always loved working with children um	3120	A
and	3120	A
i found that i couldn't	3120	A
fit everything in	3120	A
but because i had had a fair amount of French going in i was able	3120	A
to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that	3120	A
interested me um	3120	A
and so that was some of but	3120	A
several of the things you mentioned were the things that um	3120	A
our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M he's but he thinks he wants to be a writer and i don't think that	3120	A
yes	3120	A
um and really his	3120	A
his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand	3120	A
um	3120	A
and so he's used to a bigger size and because my brother is there	3120	A
uh he would have family close by so there there are advantages um but i also	3120	A
because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to	3120	A
University of Michigan which was so large and they really felt	3120	A
um like they were numbers	3120	A
you still	3120	A
yeah	3120	A
well that's- that's certainly um	3120	A
especially today with the cost of college i mean that is a a major	3120	A
um consideration and i do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools and even though Baylor um	3120	A
and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there	3120	A
who just love it and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and	3120	A
um	3120	A
i do feel like there are a lot of options it's it's	3120	A
but i had been hoping some schools i know give um	3120	A
oh even this year Jay had an aptitude	3120	A
test um	3120	A
yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and	3120	A
we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter	3120	A
know what she'd like to do	3120	A
yeah	3120	A
yes	3120	A
um-hum	3120	A
yes	3120	A
well he but he has even now that he's in high school um and of course there's there is	3120	A
still time but he's beginning to feel that	3120	A
as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it you know it's the it's	3120	A
well	3151	A
basically i think it would be a good idea myself	3151	A
i uh	3151	A
i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh like i don't think one test positive should	3151	A
uh be uh	3151	A
the end of it you know i i think they should test more than once	3151	A
it	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
that's right	3151	A
um-hum um-hum there's so many jobs that uh really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life and you know and it's uh	3151	A
uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it	3151	A
you know and i just um	3151	A
i i think there definitely needs to be some control to it i guess it is possible to have a false	3151	A
positive report	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
or somebody's test get mixed up with somebody else's i mean those things do happen	3151	A
uh i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined uh wrongly	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that uh doesn't require the testing	3151	A
uh	3151	A
to me	3151	A
it's to me it's not an invasion of privacy i think it's people have a right to know if if uh their their life maybe is in jeopardy or uh	3151	A
yeah their work the work they're doing for their company	3151	A
uh those things are all affected if not immediately it certainly does eventually	3151	A
i think that's where a lot of the problem is at first it doesn't seem to	3151	A
uh bother the quality of work	3151	A
but eventually it does	3151	A
um-hum um-hum	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
course i feel the same way on the AIDS problem	3151	A
i i don't think that's an invasion of privacy that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for	3151	A
you know and it's destroying a lot of people's lives	3151	A
yeah and it's you know it's it's destroying people's lives and i i think	3151	A
that person plus anybody in danger should should be- know about it and be aware of it	3151	A
so i don't know it's it's kind of hard to	3151	A
i guess the the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy of course that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today i guess so	3151	A
kind of get off on a tangent here uh do you work for uh Texas Instruments uh-huh	3151	A
um	3151	A
oh that's probably way my brother did live in Grapevine Texas that's near Dallas	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3151	A
it's pretty hot down there probably	3151	A
yeah	3151	A
oh did you really oh that's great	3151	A
uh-huh we we need rain real bad up here it's uh everything's really getting dry it's uh	3151	A
yeah it's kind of at a dangerous level here people hauling water and uh it's getting real bad	3151	A
so so	3151	A
um	3151	A
so do i	3151	A
uh i can't think of anything else uh	3151	A
uh-huh	3151	A
uh-huh uh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them	3151	A
i can see them objecting	3151	A
you know there's a lot of people that think there's nothing wrong with	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
um um-hum um-hum	3151	A
um is that right	3151	A
oh i'll be darn	3151	A
yeah yeah the different cultures and that too uh	3151	A
no no i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
oh yeah you can't you go by their laws	3151	A
the same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there that's why a lot get in trouble	3151	A
because they have to follow their rules and uh some of the countries are very much against drugs and	3151	A
you use them you pay for it	3151	A
yeah- yeah a lot of them yeah where where is it they lose a	3151	A
if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger is that where it is i thought wow you know that's quite a deterrent	3151	A
yeah yeah	3151	A
yeah so i guess you know we really- we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great our country is	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
um-hum	3151	A
they they abuse it is what they do yeah yeah	3151	A
so	3151	A
um	3151	A
well how do you feel about spot testing- spot testing for drugs	3151	B
um-hum	3151	B
right	3151	B
yeah it's- it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these people that are against it that may they- yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they they call it an invasion of privacy	3151	B
and i don't see you know that to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for	3151	B
and they i believe that they have the right to know if you're using a a dangerous substance	3151	B
but	3151	B
um-hum	3151	B
right	3151	B
yeah no i i i agree that you know you there there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program just because you know you you- something can get mixed up in the mail or	3151	B
uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than than what you would expect them to and yeah you	3151	B
right	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
right and you know i've the the the company that i work for uh has just recently well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees they submit to a uh urine test	3151	B
and	3151	B
they they say that there've been you know they they they've also implemented random testing	3151	B
and it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that you know it's been in progress but uh i i fully agree with it and there's you know there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy and	3151	B
i i agree with you if if if you feel it's an invasion of privacy you've you've probably got something you're trying to hide	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
right	3151	B
or the quality of their products	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
um-hum	3151	B
right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect	3151	B
hum	3151	B
and then and one of the few that they don't have a cure for	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
yes i do	3151	B
and i'm i'm down in the the central but i don't know how familiar you are with Texas but i'm in a we live in a town uh near a town called Temple which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway	3151	B
right we're yeah we're probably about two two and a half hours south of him	3151	B
so	3151	B
oh my it's actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday and it's cooled things down somewhat it's getting more humid now but	3151	B
um	3151	B
it's been about three weeks since we had any	3151	B
hum	3151	B
wow	3151	B
how about that	3151	B
well i hope you do get some rain up there	3151	B
but	3151	B
yeah i i i guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation you know	3151	B
one of the things i found interesting it it's funny that you mentioned that TI is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world	3151	B
including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal	3151	B
and the policy doesn't apply to those folks	3151	B
yeah they don't have to submit to drug testing like like they do here in the States and some places abroad	3151	B
yeah i thought that was kind of interesting too	3151	B
yeah i mean uh uh from from a quality standpoint that's not i mean just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
right	3151	B
yeah but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules i mean if if you know that's that's the trade off i guess	3151	B
yeah	3151	B
hum	3151	B
right	3151	B
that's right	3151	B
yeah from the Middle East	3151	B
yeah Iraq Iran in that area yeah	3151	B
well in in Saudi Arabia you know using uh alcohol and drugs and stuff like that you get the death penalty	3151	B
so it's pretty strict over there	3151	B
yeah yeah	3151	B
so that's	3151	B
i don't know i'm i'm i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy	3151	B
okay	3181	A
uh-huh	3181	A
i am too yes	3181	A
uh-huh	3181	A
oh that's good	3181	A
and how old is your baby	3181	A
yes well i walk two and a half to three miles every night	3181	A
my husband and i were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago and he lost sixty two pounds and i lost twenty one	3181	A
so we've decided to maintain our weight that we will do this exercise walking program and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school we have a little path that we do	3181	A
and uh except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been we try to get out um every every night	3181	A
and he plays racquetball twice a week but i'm not into that so i think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned	3181	A
yes	3181	A
right that's right i know my kids are into sports and a lot of times tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty so we will just go out after that	3181	A
so my kids luckily are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk	3181	A
yes	3181	A
yes	3181	A
no my husband never was either until he lost the weight that was his decision he had arthritis in his hips and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise	3181	A
so once he got motivated now he's ready to walk every night and our dog has lost a little weight he walks every night too	3181	A
so he gets excited when he sees us put on our our shoes our walking shoes	3181	A
yes	3181	A
making time for it	3181	A
yes	3181	A
i know i do too	3181	A
right	3181	A
no i never do either even if i have my dog with me you know it's nice to have another person there but	3181	A
mostly it's my husband and sometimes it's my kids	3181	A
oh	3181	A
uh-huh	3181	A
me too i did the dance step when i lived up in Michigan and it just wore me out i would leave totally exhausted i never lost any weight and i got to the point i dreaded going in	3181	A
so walking seems to be a good solution for me and it doesn't cost anything	3181	A
yes	3181	A
that's the one time in the day my husband and i can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and	3181	A
hm yep	3181	A
yep	3181	A
yep that's all i do too okay	3181	A
all right well i'm not a big exerciser but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight	3181	B
and so basically at this point i'm i'm a real walker	3181	B
are you i don't do that oh i guess i'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips you know and keep their arms up i don't do that	3181	B
i mostly just take a a walk around the block or with my baby or you know and i have to do that at least once a day	3181	B
if it if it's going to make any effect on since i have to eat	3181	B
the same as i did before i can't neglect that because_1 of the baby either	3181	B
she just uh	3181	B
well she was premature so she's about nine months now though golly- times goes fast	3181	B
oh that's great	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
oh my goodness	3181	B
uh-huh	3181	B
uh-huh	3181	B
yeah exactly	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
well i think that is just wonderful now as far as i'm concerned i have several other children and so	3181	B
um i think at this point to fit it into to to other things it's kind of a task you know um	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
yeah now does your husband usually go with you then oh see now that's really nice because mine's at meetings sometimes and and he's not really into it so i have to	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
i think that is so wonderful	3181	B
i bet	3181	B
i think that's really really good and and you know it- i think this after you've done it a certain amount of time it kind of does get to be a routine it's not like when i first started it	3181	B
you know that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there but now if i haven't done it in a day or two or something i really notice	3181	B
that i haven't done it in you know and i like the time because my kids sometimes they come with me and sometimes they don't	3181	B
and when they don't i i really notice you know it how fun it can be when they come so um i like to have somebody come with me	3181	B
um i know most of enough- enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home around this block area so it would- it's not real dangerous but still i don't like to go alone so	3181	B
yeah	3181	B
yeah you know	3181	B
well i think that's great i'm and well sometimes when i	3181	B
i take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise i i really think	3181	B
i do i was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing um	3181	B
i found real quick that wasn't for me	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
yeah yeah	3181	B
um-hum	3181	B
yeah need something or they can wait till you get back home well i think that's great	3181	B
okay	3100	A
you there well have you had	3100	A
this with one of your parents yet	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
what what is do they want done that's interesting that they've already said	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
now my parents are seventy nine and eighty one	3100	A
and they're they're still	3100	A
taking care of themselves but	3100	A
when they were your parents age they were doing much better now it's gotten to where it's just barely and we know it's going to be probably	3100	A
anytime you know that that we're going to have to	3100	A
change them from their home or something you know	3100	A
no my stepfather is one that's always had a horror of nursing homes and don't ever put me there now my mother on the other hand i don't think would mind you know	3100	A
uh they live in a small town uh a hundred and twenty miles northeast of Dallas and uh	3100	A
and so the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their	3100	A
advantage but uh i guess you know i don't know how long i have a brother and two stepsisters but	3100	A
we really haven't really discussed it that much either we should have by this point you know at seventy nine and eighty one but i guess we're just waiting to see what happens and then i guess we'll make a make decisions then	3100	A
and uh but my stepfather's health is is failing bad you know i don't know if he has starting of Alzheimer or	3100	A
or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery he's been going down hill you know	3100	A
and uh so anyway i uh by this time we should have probably made some decisions but we haven't so i- i can see a lot of friends	3100	A
here in the neighborhood too uh one's mother just got to where she couldn't take care of herself anymore in Florida as far as you know eating meals and	3100	A
all that kind of stuff she just wasn't doing it you know so she has come to live with her daughter in the neighborhood	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
i've almost been surprised the last three or four years with my friends in the neighborhood as many	3100	A
mothers it's always been mothers have come to live in the home but then maybe they'll have a stroke or something and and then then they'll go to the nursing home but they go to the home first	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
uh-huh	3100	A
that would make it easier yeah if if you were but like you say then to uproot them_1 and take them_1 to another state or something	3100	A
but uh in some of the cases i was talking about_1 in the neighborhood though they have been up rooted from another state but then but then maybe things	3100	A
had gotten where they live that they never really saw anybody much any more anyway you know	3100	A
too uh they you know get to where they don't get out that much anymore	3100	A
maybe especially_1 if they hadn't always lived in that area they're moving from	3100	A
right	3100	A
right and of course one thing we haven't even discussed that makes a big bearing on what you do is the cost	3100	A
you know if the parents if they were- are going into some kind of of nursing type home you know that	3100	A
helps helps them uh you know do they have the money to pay for it or are the children going to help out to make up the difference	3100	A
you know if there's two parents that might be three thousand	3100	A
okay	3100	B
uh not with my parents although my parents are now in their early seventies	3100	B
and uh fortunately they have to this point been very physically healthy and very self sufficient	3100	B
and they really looked after themselves and i think considered what they want done as they get older and maybe less able	3100	B
well the it it's more that they've established- they when they retired and we're from South Dakota	3100	B
so they retired from the rural farming community into Sioux Falls which is the biggest city in the state	3100	B
and set themselves up near medical facilities and i- i can't say i can tell you what they've uh decided as to okay because i think some of that is that	3100	B
maybe you think ahead somewhat but you don't uh book those facilities yeah	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
well have they do they recognize the coming and try to make the decision themselves	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
yeah that is one of the options but uh that is so related to the family situation of the children and	3100	B
uh you know i guess not that it's happened in our case in my family because it well i have seen it in their generation it what you do is first see your parents go through it with their parents	3100	B
and i would say well at this point um you could say been through all that because i have no no grandparents left uh and it's	3100	B
you see all the different options and you see that they all can work uh	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
well if they're uh that's the thing if they're physically able it is a much more pleasant more caring uh situation to be in the home of one of the children	3100	B
uh the other side of that is that if the children are no where near where the uh parents had spent their life then in a sense you you have no friends at the new place	3100	B
uh in this that you are unless that you develop new friends and uh the best thing is kind of a combination where	3100	B
uh the at least one of the children if not several are uh uh back in the area where the parents uh had spent their years and then	3100	B
yeah	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
uh-huh	3100	B
yes well it's it's not an easy choice because it's uh but uh it's something that we all face and we uh	3100	B
yeah but the way society changes it makes it so that uh what was acceptable for our parents and their parents	3100	B
uh may not be as workable for us it it's certainly a problem as we as people live older of course as long as you can live a healthy life uh	3100	B
the uh the care is is not near the issue it becomes when you start having the physical problems	3100	B
yes	3100	B
right	3100	B
well i am a tax preparer myself so i do about five hundred income taxes a year in fact i even do television and radio shows here in the	3192	B
Dallas market uh regarding income taxes make sure every one pays the right amount	3192	B
and i am convinced that uh most people try to hum-um cheat ever so slightly	3192	B
on their tax returns only because uh	3192	B
the way the IRS does things they're not gonna give you any breaks i mean they they encourage you to cheat because if you should get audited they're gonna get you for everything and and some more on top of that	3192	B
that	3192	B
that's right	3192	B
easily easily	3192	B
yep	3192	B
well see	3192	B
well Texas we are a community property state so we have some a little bit different rules than you have in the separate property state such as uh where you in Ohio but	3192	B
we- we do not have state income taxes yet but we see it on the horizon it hadn't hit here yet but we do have	3192	B
yeah but how much do you pay in sales tax	3192	B
okay we're at eight and a fourth right now	3192	B
true	3192	B
true true	3192	B
no	3192	B
but are you of the fact that when you prepare your tax return now obviously if you have an error in the IRS's favor they're going to be very quick to come back to you and say hey you owe this much more tax	3192	B
but if there is an error in your favor they do not come back to you and say oh you get a refund they	3192	B
yeah so you know if what's fair for the goose is good for the gander	3192	B
and unfortunately the IRS is saying you know we have screwed y'all so many times that's why so many tax payers are starting to cheat more and more which is a shame	3192	B
but i think the IRS has brought it on {themself} because they're not being very helpful to those who have made errors	3192	B
and i think if they would- i think if they would come back and say hey look this is wrong this is the way it should be done we're gonna give you some refunds and so forth and actually show an honest effort to be good on both sides of the fence we wanna collect as much tax we also wanna give back as much tax	3192	B
i- i think that you'd have a better feeling	3192	B
and you'd have a lot better tax returns being done	3192	B
and yet if you went to visit five different CPA's you'd get five different answers	3192	B
i think uh you sound like one of the type of clients i'd love to have	3192	B
but	3192	B
go ahead what do you have to say on the subject	3192	A
and then they're gonna tax you on that for or they're gonna give you an interest on it i know somebody that it happened to	3192	A
no see believe it or not i'm one of these honest guys	3192	A
but i get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer expenses when i sat down when we were through and i sat down with our accountant and we did it	3192	A
if i'm not presently working outside of the home if i return to work	3192	A
believe it or not with our state income tax our city income tax city we live in and city we work in	3192	A
i would have lost and with social security i would have lost forty eight cents on every dollar that i earned	3192	A
sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would disrupt our	3192	A
travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said it's not worth it i'm not working any more	3192	A
it just isn't worth it and you get frustrated and yet i don't know what the Texas- uh the Texas rules are	3192	A
do you pay a state income income tax	3192	A
you don't	3192	A
uh sales tax we pay seven percent	3192	A
you're so you're higher but you get {out-of-towners} on that then you get everyone on your state uh sales tax which is good	3192	A
as uh the income tax what's not fair is paying in the city you live in right now we're living where there is a reciprocity	3192	A
so if you do pay more in the city you're working you don't owe your city anything	3192	A
and this year well my husband's actually keeping track of all his time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the difference because_1 our city is a little bit less	3192	A
right	3192	A
oh absolutely- and much less they don't pay you an interest	3192	A
right	3192	A
well and it is now to the point that it has gotten so um	3192	A
so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and i've done it with transfers and sale of property	3192	A
but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it let's go see a CPA well	3192	A
that's what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment you you have excelled she said i cannot find one	3192	A
thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records	3192	A
all year long as i go one on twice a month one on	3192	A
well that's what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it	3192	A
uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because_1 i said well i've got all everything-	3192	A
no	3101	B
oh yeah	3101	B
yeah i went and saw boat today i about flipped over it	3101	B
i'm not i'm not sure what kind it was i saw it just sitting on the side of the road	3101	B
yeah- oh yeah no doubt about it	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
oh yeah	3101	B
that sounds neat	3101	B
well- at least you have weekends off	3101	B
oh i know i know i don't have that luxury yet	3101	B
yeah i am in the restaurant business i run restaurants and uh didn't really don't really have that time off yet so	3101	B
it was out out in out in Garland	3101	B
yeah this one's big too	3101	B
oh that'd be great	3101	B
i think i could probably handle that	3101	B
for awhile	3101	B
well that'd be great	3101	B
who cares about sanity though	3101	B
i know it no telephone no fax machines nothing- nothing	3101	B
oh that's true	3101	B
well- that's good	3101	B
seven that's about the right age	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
oh yeah	3101	B
yeah i sure do	3101	B
oh really	3101	B
huh	3101	B
that's kind of different	3101	B
yeah i kind of i kind of enjoyed that boat i looked at today it's nice and clean it wasn't yeah it was not that old	3101	B
no it didn't it's open open up front had a little and it was open in the back too in the back kind of had a little	3101	B
deck in the back of it also	3101	B
yeah it was kind of different i thought	3101	B
yeah it was	3101	B
rather large- i do not know how big it was or anything i was just looking at it and until i got around to the for sale sign	3101	B
uh fourteen thousand	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
uh pardon me	3101	B
no it couldn't have been that old it's	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
no i did not even- i did not even look at it i got around the price tag and said okay	3101	B
i said that's enough	3101	B
yeah i know it	3101	B
um where do you all where do you all go skiing	3101	B
oh i know it	3101	B
yeah that's true	3101	B
uh somebody was talking about that at one time they were talking about uh	3101	B
was it one hundred fifty a month	3101	B
something a hundred twenty a hundred twenty a hundred fifty a month oh i know it	3101	B
well it yeah it is and	3101	B
yeah especially on water even	3101	B
with some wood going around it	3101	B
yeah everybody's got to make a buck though	3101	B
the name of the game i think	3101	B
working around the working around the water and take off on the boat anytime you wanted to	3101	B
yeah in it's truest sense right	3101	B
well that's good does he know how to work on them_1 or just minor stuff	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
yeah	3101	B
that's true	3101	B
took took it in and got it got all of its shots right	3101	B
right	3101	B
oh i know it or that time off one of the two	3101	B
yeah it helps it helps	3101	B
oh i know it	3101	B
man it's supposed to be	3101	B
myself	3101	B
all right take care	3101	B
bye-bye	3101	B
okay do you have a boat	3101	A
do you like to boat oh yeah	3101	A
what kind	3101	A
oh a ski boat though	3101	A
we have a seventeen foot invader	3101	A
and yeah it's we've only had it a couple of years but it's so much better than the other boat we had a an older trihold that was just horrible because_1 i mean God you felt every wave	3101	A
but the uh the invader is really neat i really like it it's got the bow up and the bow down and all that stuff so it's kind of fun	3101	A
yeah so we ski every weekend	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
we didn't i think i'd go nuts	3101	A
oh really	3101	A
oh	3101	A
yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat	3101	A
oh well there's been one sitting up in Addison for the last few days that's really neat it's a Baja but it's huge	3101	A
i think it'd be more boat than i'd want right now	3101	A
huh well eventually my husband thinks that we are going to sell everything that we own and live on a boat in the Caribbean	3101	A
yeah i think we'd kill each other	3101	A
well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah	3101	A
but i'd i mean i'd have to get away from him eventually but another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that and he said that they're just planning to take their bikes and then go into port every once in a while and	3101	A
say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way	3101	A
yeah i do not know if i could live on a boat	3101	A
well i know what could make you insane floating around in the middle of the Caribbean	3101	A
exactly	3101	A
well that's another thing- good thing about our boat is going out on the weekends at least we're forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing	3101	A
so even if we do not ski but now that the water is warm enough we have been skiing a lot and my little seven year old nephew is coming next week so i guess i will have to teach him how to ski	3101	A
yeah i think that's about when i learned	3101	A
do you ski	3101	A
oh yeah do you have your own ski and everything	3101	A
oh yeah it's a lot of fun my husband has a wet suit so he can ski pretty much year around if he if he has the guts to	3101	A
but uh it was really neat last weekend we were sitting out in the in the boat and a a a school of shad came bebopping across the water and he threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast	3101	A
yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool	3101	A
so anyway	3101	A
yeah i was amazed	3101	A
really did it have a cabin	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
oh really	3101	A
huh	3101	A
it must've been pretty big	3101	A
huh	3101	A
how much was it	3101	A
oh my i wonder how old it was was it very old	3101	A
huh was it inboard outboard	3101	A
you don't know how big the engine was	3101	A
yeah well ours will be paid off in ninety three and i will feel like i hit the lottery then i guess but	3101	A
it's pretty nice it's nice to have it's a good way to get away Kyle is afraid that he doesn't want me to to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is there's like a forty five degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to	3101	A
we go to Lewisville and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because_1 now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but	3101	A
it's really nice having it in the garage because_1 then if we want to go to Whitney or you know Grapevine or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go	3101	A
so plus i don't have any idea how much slip rental is it probably probably get a little expensive i would think	3101	A
whoa	3101	A
i think i'll keep it in the garage	3101	A
that's outrageous	3101	A
just to have a place to park you boat	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
that's pretty wild	3101	A
oh that's true	3101	A
well that's what we were coming back from Arkansas i guess last October and there was a marina for sale	3101	A
and he said now that would be a fun job	3101	A
but yeah i can probably do that for a while	3101	A
yeah	3101	A
yeah you know hang out the gone fishing sign	3101	A
really	3101	A
i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems	3101	A
so but Kyle's real good with the maintenance i think that that's real important so fortunately he knows what he is doing there	3101	A
well just the minor stuff uh we took it in for its hundred hour check up and all that stuff but you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good	3101	A
so that's fine i can live with that	3101	A
yeah it's kind of like our only child now	3101	A
well hopefully someday you will get that dream boat and-	3101	A
yeah really yeah you kind of need need them_1 to go hand in hand i guess	3101	A
yeah because_1 i mean i there's times you know even our weekends where we don't have time to go and it's sad because_1 you think God you are paying all that money for the boat and it's just sitting there	3101	A
so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go	3101	A
i hope so	3101	A
well i enjoyed talking to you okay maybe i will get you again sometime all right bye-bye	3101	A
okay	3162	A
um well it's not such a bad idea to think about judges uh	3162	A
you know taking the idea of uh	3162	A
uh sentencing in into their hands versus you know the jury especially if it's a highly publicized case	3162	A
such as uh you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read uh certain	3162	A
uh things in regards to cases like the Dahmer case in Milwaukee and stuff so it's it may be an idea to think about	3162	A
you know cost trying to find a jury so you can- get a jury as far as	3162	A
um they may say they're not biased but deep down they are against- against this person or whatever so um i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about so	3162	A
exactly	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
catches you off guard doesn't it	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
i didn't think they were either i thought the sentencing was done by the judge and it's either guilty or not guilty	3162	A
changes	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
oh sure yeah yeah	3162	A
exactly exactly	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
exactly	3162	A
uh-huh	3162	A
yeah	3162	A
kind of how i you knows in certain cases i can see them going uh uh just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict	3162	A
uh simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small	3162	A
um maybe uh you did a crime that was uh	3162	A
burglary or whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized but when you get into these highly publicized cases	3162	A
where everybody knows details whether it's through the National Enquirer or whatever	3162	A
um it's the idea that person might initially have this thought well jeez this person's guilty no matter what i'm not gonna listen to the facts or and and	3162	A
con their way into uh getting past the lawyers and and getting through that but um also there's the aspect of cost and i i'm not quite sure how much cost it does	3162	A
take for uh the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's uh very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what	3162	A
you know being that i'm not in the that area i really don't know but i wonder	3162	A
if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial	3162	A
and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at least- give them the time off	3162	A
from work uh whether it i think it's with pay if i remember jury duty is with pay	3162	A
and uh it's not it	3162	A
hm	3162	A
paid right	3162	A
um-hum	3162	A
some that may decide not to	3162	A
hm	3162	A
yeah	3162	B
right that a that a a a a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not depend- and and uh	3162	B
not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective well i- i i certainly haven't thought much about this but	3162	B
i was trying to remember back it seems to me that that you know when i studied civics in school or stuff that this	3162	B
the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't wasn't so much and i'm i'm trying to	3162	B
figure out whether that's i'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
yeah and	3162	B
uh i guess- i guess uh and i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some	3162	B
Supreme Supreme Court decision perhaps that said that uh that uh as part of the trial by the peers that i had to include the sentencing or too or whatever i'd yeah but i	3162	B
yeah i- i certainly wouldn't be uh uh worried about that i guess in terms of the uh	3162	B
uh you know having- having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and uh unbiased uh	3162	B
in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury i guess i guess i uh	3162	B
would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in a trial system that that's just a such a tradition that it's a that it's got to be a unanimous jury that uh	3162	B
i don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else uh you know uh two thirds or three fourths or whatever but uh	3162	B
and and i- i- i certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority um	3162	B
yeah yeah	3162	B
whatever yeah	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
yeah	3162	B
well and and i'm i'd i'd i know it is i know it is where i where i work but i'm not sure that that's	3162	B
that that's necessarily required uh you know by law that it has to be paid um	3162	B
i suspect that's a that's a	3162	B
benefit of a bigger company but but there are certainly some	3162	B
some that some that wouldn't uh yeah	3162	B
okay	3113	B
right	3113	B
right i agree too i don't think the jury should be the ones that that put the sentencings down i think the judges should or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point	3113	B
might be better apt than just regular civil people	3113	B
not knowing you know exactly what things are from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know	3113	B
right	3113	B
yeah and	3113	B
right that's yeah and- and and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes or you know what whatever the case may be and and may not have any idea	3113	B
of what what the standard punishment would be for it and it they may have some different idea i mean it might be more important for them to put a sentencing- sentencing- sentencing down that was uh	3113	B
longer you know that didn't fit the punishment didn't fit the crime	3113	B
or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be	3113	B
i i think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it the only thing i worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and	3113	B
you know sometimes might have- have more pull which that does happen i mean we- we can't say it doesn't because it does happen i mean not everybody is is you know	3113	B
has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically or	3113	B
whatever the case may be and sometimes that's not real fair either though so	3113	B
um-hum	3113	B
right	3113	B
right right well well also what i don't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in and and his attorney	3113	B
gets his sentences sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like i don't know what assault or something or	3113	B
but which that doesn't make any sense to me either i know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot and and and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't i mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff and they they're put on like	3113	B
they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime	3113	B
then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know	3113	B
have the same thing happen that's that's not right	3113	B
right	3113	B
um-hum	3113	B
yeah	3113	B
and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there	3113	B
so the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information don't they	3113	B
they only put part of it	3113	B
yeah	3113	B
right well that's just like that old witness game well it's a game kids play too but um	3113	B
somebody did it just ah	3113	B
just for your train of thought where they they showed something	3113	B
and they asked there there there were uh like four people	3113	B
okay well i uh i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers i'm not a lawyer uh that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure	3113	A
and i i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to uh uh they can find guilt or innocence	3113	A
uh but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that	3113	A
uh-huh	3113	A
yeah because_1 i find that uh i've been on a few juries and uh as a say i i tend to be around uh civil cases	3113	A
because i've been an expert witness some and uh	3113	A
many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to uh come up with the fair value uh	3113	A
or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is	3113	A
uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime	3113	A
uh that uh when i only do something one two or three times i'm hardly an expert on it and	3113	A
most juries	3113	A
over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three	3113	A
and so how do you relate as to whether this	3113	A
particular armed robbery was a you know worth five years or twenty five	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
yes	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
yeah	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
well one of the others things that gets me on on the juries is that often in the newspaper	3113	A
i i tend to hear two things well that go on one is you often see in the headlines	3113	A
the big numbers	3113	A
uh and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed	3113	A
by a judge or an Appeals Court and that never makes the the press and so when uh you or i as an individual	3113	A
gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines	3113	A
uh and we don't have uh again a lot of knowledge so we don't know what is really going on what is uh	3113	A
really the range of sentences or awards that are uh are actually uh in the end applied	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
yeah	3113	A
well that's where uh uh the role of juries is is restricted and uh i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it one is it's restricted in the sense that	3113	A
juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if it's first degree rape second degree- degree rape or whatever	3113	A
they only get to decide on that well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape uh and you can decide guilt or innocence on that uh such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's uh premeditated or	3113	A
one or two of the lesser degrees and- the other thing that juries are restricted on and and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my even in my own experiences that you	3113	A
usually don't get to hear all the information it's what information is presented and	3113	A
uh i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story	3113	A
when they have to decide guilt or innocence	3113	A
um-hum	3113	A
yeah and the truth that's brought out is uh as i say when i've heard about you know the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth	3113	A
is that they want uh they don't want uh the whole truth i mean you can say yeah the because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the of the truth	3113	A
well my favorite type of music is classical music and uh i i enjoy orchestral classical music and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano	3152	A
you know and that's	3152	A
those are my that's my favorite type uh probably the favorite instrument would be uh the violin	3152	A
yeah you know i guess i enjoy i enjoy jazz listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good	3152	A
good- good understanding of it or a good a good- good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not but but um i enjoy it and uh	3152	A
sometimes i enjoy listening to uh fiddle music we were in Colorado recently and heard this	3152	A
these uh	3152	A
well we heard this fiddler and we bought his we bought his tape and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans	3152	A
so	3152	A
oh Chris Xeros oh you lucky thing	3152	A
yeah	3152	A
oh gosh Chris Xeros you grew up with his children too then	3152	A
oh gosh	3152	A
gosh small world huh	3152	A
oh	3152	A
oh gosh well actually i used to play in the Richardson Symphony i played violin in the orchestra for several years	3152	A
you know yeah so	3152	A
yeah small world so i you know i know Chris	3152	A
most of the time	3152	A
no no well life just took different turns here so uh it just doesn't work out to do that now so he's he's about ready to retire another year and he	3152	A
yeah i heard that it's it's daughter it's his daughter that	3152	A
oh	3152	A
was it a boy or a girl	3152	A
yeah what did they name him	3152	A
oh	3152	A
oh	3152	A
of course	3152	A
oh yeah yeah	3152	A
oh so you've heard the Richardson Symphony yeah	3152	A
yeah	3152	A
do you have a favorite instrument	3152	A
yes	3152	A
oh did you	3152	A
oh	3152	A
oh	3152	A
and it played by itself	3152	A
well i mean but you didn't have oboe or something with it	3152	A
oh	3152	A
yeah oh well that's really yeah that's i bet that was nice	3152	A
oh	3152	A
right	3152	A
right	3152	A
right right	3152	A
well actually i play i play the violin in in a string quartet that often plays at weddings	3152	A
so um i always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano	3152	A
and it makes it makes it nice it makes you know you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else	3152	A
oh	3152	A
yeah	3152	A
oh now does does the school in in your in your city does it	3152	A
does it offer like band or some of the instruments	3152	A
okay	3152	A
right	3152	A
right uh right	3152	A
probably oh gosh	3152	A
yeah	3152	A
right	3152	A
right you got a little ways to go too right	3152	A
great wow well my my oldest is eight and and she's we've started her on piano so uh	3152	A
but that's been it's been fun i mean it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared but it's been fun it's- it's been fun i feel like i've learned a lot about the piano i've learned a lot about playing the piano	3152	A
and uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing i sort of watch their technique too and	3152	A
and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning	3152	A
so it's been fun	3152	A
so	3152	A
well	3152	B
oh well my favorite well i i don't really have a favorite i i like everything basically um	3152	B
i guess if i had to pick it would be like-	3152	B
like pop i would think	3152	B
but i like everything so it's kind of hard to choose sometimes	3152	B
um-hum	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
i grew up next door to uh the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader so	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
so we used to go and listen to them all the time and my parents still do	3152	B
so i grew up with a lot of his music and and what not	3152	B
plus my parents are well especially my dad likes a lot of classical music and he introduced my brother and i both to a lot of it	3152	B
so	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
yeah sure did	3152	B
yeah we all went to high school together and we're still in contact with each other we all go back to parents' houses on the weekends and what not so	3152	B
oh really	3152	B
it is a small world isn't it	3152	B
yeah he a pretty nice guy	3152	B
yeah well i never i had to work for him and i never would want to work for him so	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
yeah he sure is he just became a grandfather	3152	B
uh uh-huh yeah they just had the baby's christening so	3152	B
it was really nice so	3152	B
he's a little boy	3152	B
i can't it it's a	3152	B
oh gosh it's like Elijah or something like that	3152	B
i keep forgetting what what she named him	3152	B
his middle name is Chris or Christopher for for her daddy but i think it's Elijah	3152	B
it starts with an E	3152	B
i can't remember	3152	B
yes yeah we've heard them and liked liked it real well of course	3152	B
um	3152	B
actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord	3152	B
i really like those in fact i had a harpsichord played at my wedding	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
which was real nice i got married uh during the Christmas season and we- we played uh old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not and it was real nice i liked that a lot	3152	B
i liked the sound of the harpsichord	3152	B
no somebody played it	3152	B
no no no no no just by itself just by itself	3152	B
it was real nice	3152	B
yeah it went well it was a change you know from your traditional normal-	3152	B
normal- normal you know stuff and since it was Christmas time and and uh we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that and	3152	B
some of the old older ones that some i don't even i recognize the the melodies and whatnot but i didn't recognize the names	3152	B
so	3152	B
it was real nice	3152	B
um	3152	B
uh-huh	3152	B
it does	3152	B
it really- really does and it it has such a different sound to it anyway it's almost i don't know the way it vibrates it's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes it it's i'd i like it	3152	B
i don't know how else to explain but we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas they're uh called Odessa it's a husband and wife team that we've known for years and	3152	B
we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff too so we've had a lot of	3152	B
stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant and plus my husband's real big into music too so he doesn't play anything but	3152	B
he just likes to listen and my dad	3152	B
and my kids are now well my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and	3152	B
yeah well my my oldest is only nine so he- he hasn't really gotten into um that yet they have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to but um	3152	B
he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet	3152	B
so i think that starts in sixth grade	3152	B
so	3152	B
but i don't know he he shows- he the only thing he's really shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his my- my brother plays	3152	B
and um	3152	B
i- i don't i don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know it's just one of those things i'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something you know	3152	B
yeah just a little bit	3152	B
uh	3152	B
really	3152	B
yeah	3152	B
i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or	3152	B
well Vic you said your professional your favorite professional football team was the- was the Cowboys	3125	A
well you know i i could uh pick the uh Chicago team	3125	A
yeah i got a lot of northern neighbors here	3125	A
and uh they really uh pull for the Chicago what are the what are the Chicago team called the Bears yeah right	3125	A
Chicago- Chicago-	3125	A
right	3125	A
right well there's a lot of good teams out there in the professional world and uh course we hope also that the Cowboys do good i know i do and it's your favorite team so why don't you tell me about them	3125	A
uh-huh what's his name	3125	A
Harper um-hum	3125	A
um-hum	3125	A
i'll be darned	3125	A
well is he a fragile uh football player you know they had an end or a a wingback or something like that that would go down the field and and uh he did real good for the Cowboys and every time he turned around he was getting hurt	3125	A
i see	3125	A
what's the coach's name Johnson	3125	A
Jimmy you think he can do better this year than he did last year	3125	A
yeah	3125	A
but what about his players uh and their reactions to him and his uh kind of unorthodox professional football type uh coaching	3125	A
yeah right	3125	A
uh-huh	3125	A
uh-huh	3125	A
and Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach	3125	A
yeah uh-huh and what about the quarterback do you think he is uh going to stick in there and not wind up there with a concussion	3125	A
yeah	3125	A
that's true	3125	A
uh-huh	3125	A
well really- in reality uh they are my favorite team uh uh and have been you know back since the glory days or before the glory days	3125	A
they used to practice you know right over here uh on uh six thirty five and Coit right in that area	3125	A
yeah right uh-huh	3125	A
and uh it was a dingy little old field uh uh that uh you- you would have thought maybe a a high school would have played on and it's all surrounded you know by apartments and businesses and everything i was shocked when i saw it	3125	A
yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where the former coach you know uh stood up in there in there and	3125	A
but i guess uh you know it doesn't take a lot of uh fancy things to make a good football team	3125	A
since they did uh they were America's team you know back then	3125	A
and and i don't think they are now though looks like somebody else laid claim to that	3125	A
uh i've been to several games uh in my lifetime however i prefer to watch the uh watch the game uh via the TV tube	3125	A
yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group	3125	A
or a stands- a fan stands up or i'm looking at the cheerleaders or the clowns	3125	A
and when something does happen i say what happened you know and then course uh you can see it on the on the playback out there uh but back there when i was going i don't think it was that good	3125	A
or if they had it at all you know	3125	A
yeah uh-huh	3125	A
uh-huh we we have a lake house see and we go out of town	3125	A
and yeah we just go down there and uh watch the game	3125	A
yes absolutely and and uh if the team you know starts off good this year i think that uh they will be a a drawing card and perhaps they can uh uh return to their former glory days	3125	A
you know i had people uh all over the world you know that i run into uh say you know they think of one thing the Dallas Cowboys and the movie Dallas	3125	A
and so uh i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while he's unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and he's all uh he's all business	3125	A
and he got a lot he got he got rid of a lot of the cry babies uh the people that thought that had it they had it made because uh they were stars	3125	A
and he cleaned that out real good and and i'm sure he lost some good ones that shouldn't have gone but	3125	A
in his type offense he was looking for youth and for uh uh uh to rebuild a new team and i think that was the reason why he cut all the players	3125	A
and i think also that oil man that uh that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh	3125	A
is interested in making a dollar and and they've certainly gone to uh great lengths to you know to bring the team back into Texas for spring training	3125	A
and and also to build up the team to try to satisfy the people and the various factions you know uh especially back in the beginning i think he's done a great job	3125	A
what's his name uh	3125	A
Jones yeah	3125	A
and uh he's an oilman and he's got a little money behind him and uh and uh so you know the they've got the stadium out there it's a	3125	A
that's right	3125	B
oh you could	3125	B
okay	3125	B
the Bears right	3125	B
i'm not sure how they'll do this year i don't know who they'll use as quarterback	3125	B
i'm not sure they know who they'll use at quarterback yet	3125	B
well what uh i get optimistic about is just uh the relative age of the team now with all the youth that they've added	3125	B
and sort of a change in the nature of the team to the to more of the uh the the pure athlete type at all the positions	3125	B
um i like them having added a wide receiver with a nice track background that can high jump real high	3125	B
uh Alvin Harper i think out of Tennessee because he was a think he's about six foot three and apparently can catch anything that's anywhere near him and uh	3125	B
i understand that in high school he high jumped seven feet	3125	B
when he was in high school so uh he creates a real problem for people now	3125	B
uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it	3125	B
getting hurt i don't think this one has any a record like that he seems to be more of a	3125	B
a a sturdy athlete	3125	B
i know they have lost a lot of their receivers to injuries in the last few years	3125	B
yeah Jimmy	3125	B
well he did better last year than most people thought including including myself but uh	3125	B
well i guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college atmosphere to it than than certainly than his predecessor	3125	B
i really don't know how they they really react to that It probably does him well right now with with like i said the youth he has on the team	3125	B
um	3125	B
i think one thing he did this year that will probably pay some dividends is is changing the offensive	3125	B
coach that bring in a new uh offense and new offensive system that i think the so far the players are are uh responding- responding well to	3125	B
well that's the theory	3125	B
well i don't know whether anybody can for a whole year anymore	3125	B
but uh he is uh he's pretty sturdy but he's got to learn to get rid of it pretty quick	3125	B
uh well is Cowboys your your favorite team as well or	3125	B
right	3125	B
well over there at uh near Forrest i think and uh-huh	3125	B
that's the one that	3125	B
i think that was the place that had the looked like corrugated tin fence around it painted blue	3125	B
right	3125	B
well i guess not but	3125	B
yeah during that time period they sure were	3125	B
do you go to many of	3125	B
do you go to many of the games or have you before	3125	B
well i guess i do too really	3125	B
right	3125	B
uh-huh	3125	B
right that's right i think i went to more of their games when they were still operating out of uh the Cotton Bowl	3125	B
than i have since they moved to Texas Stadium	3125	B
course	3125	B
oh that works out nicely	3125	B
i'm hoping that they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year	3125	B
uh-huh	3125	B
that's right	3125	B
yeah he is that	3125	B
right	3125	B
uh-huh	3125	B
right	3125	B
well that's nice	3125	B
oh the uh Jones yeah Jones is his name	3125	B
okay do you want to start	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
now that do you do you agree that they should all be unanimous	3118	A
or even even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
uh-huh	3118	A
well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees	3118	A
so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in	3118	A
and they have to stay in until they all agree yeah i don't know i'm not sure if they go i mean to twelve new people	3118	A
or what they do exactly but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either you know either he or she can either go free or to jail either one	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
that's just that's just it i don't understand you're supposed to you know go in if you have you know like if you've never heard of the people before or anything	3118	A
but i don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total totally impartial to it	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
yeah i agree i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over	3118	A
you know so it it's i- i- i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know	3118	A
i- i don't know if it's the way it is in real life but i've seen it on TV where the juries go one way and the judge totally- totally finds it obnoxious and he completely you know goes the other way	3118	A
now i'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
i- i think it's just i don't i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get but i just think it's really hard- you know i mean some cases go on for years you know	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
i- i don't know how it could be more fair	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
i know i don't know that much about it either	3118	A
i don't	3118	A
i- i don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way	3118	A
um-hum	3118	A
yeah	3118	A
oh i think we can hang up anytime	3118	A
no i don't know what else to say so	3118	A
it was nice talking to you too bye	3118	A
okay um	3118	B
i haven't i don't know that much about the possible- what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but	3118	B
um i think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide	3118	B
i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new unanimous	3118	B
i don't	3118	B
i don't know i don't know if i feel i don't feel real strongly about that if the um the thing is though i- i didn't think that even if it was a lower conviction i didn't think that you could	3118	B
um i didn't think that you really had to have a a jury	3118	B
unless i guess if you request one you can but i think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might um	3118	B
and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded	3118	B
yeah well if it's no but they they what if they never agree doesn't it just um do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or	3118	B
agree	3118	B
yeah	3118	B
yeah and that maybe on the lesser	3118	B
crimes that aren't too severe that's a little stringent	3118	B
especially because there's twelve the thing about it is i think jury selection too a lot of times um	3118	B
the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way too	3118	B
i know i don't think well i guess you really can't but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either	3118	B
so um but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they	3118	B
they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements too	3118	B
i know	3118	B
yeah	3118	B
i think in some cases they are but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's you know so that's another thing where they have the power but	3118	B
maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair maybe there should be more than twelve people i don't	3118	B
i know i don't know	3118	B
and lose their not lose their jobs but not go to work	3118	B
it could be	3118	B
really i've never seen one in real life either so i don't have you know i don't know that much about it but i think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries i don't know how we could make it more fair i really don't	3118	B
the unanimous vote is questionable though and and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too	3118	B
because uh	3118	B
i don't know if you should have- really- really have a jury for small- a small	3118	B
infraction	3118	B
right	3118	B
no whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique i think when they started it	3118	B
okay um in um what do i do now do you know anything or just wait for someone else	3118	B
okay- okay well it was nice talking with you	3118	B
thanks bye-bye	3118	B
alright	3138	A
sometimes not all the time	3138	A
right	3138	A
yeah that that's about the same boat i'm in too	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
uh five	3138	A
oh yeah well i'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too so	3138	A
and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have	3138	A
uh	3138	A
oh yeah well see i my- my oldest is nine and he already he already does that	3138	A
and i told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat	3138	A
um	3138	A
my husband and i our favorite meal is um and we do it like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak and he does the steak and then uh	3138	A
uh-huh and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does and it's real good and uh i do sauteed mushrooms so and asparagus and that's our favorite	3138	A
dinner	3138	A
yeah so do we	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
it's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it	3138	A
i don't know what that i don't see how you eat that but	3138	A
oh	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
so it	3138	A
yeah it defeats the purpose	3138	A
oh yeah yeah my husband makes those i'm not i don't eat enchiladas i i don't like enchiladas- i don't like the texture- i don't know i guess it's the texture or something i don't like the taste of enchiladas but everyone else in my family does	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
i don't know i it's i don't know what i don't know i i don't know what it is about the enchiladas i just and i'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother i'm the only one that doesn't eat it but my kids love it you know	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
yeah i've got a chicken casserole that's like that that that i've	3138	A
yeah because i when i make this chicken casserole i it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that i freeze	3138	A
so or i give it to my Mom and Dad if i know we're not going to eat	3138	A
it's just- you can use chicken or turkey because_1 my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey	3138	A
and it's rice and i- i- i when i do recipes i just throw stuff in i don't i'm not real good about measuring because i just i do it to taste	3138	A
and	3138	A
well yeah but it it's like it's just chicken it it's as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice	3138	A
and celery and that's it and some hard boiled eggs	3138	A
and that's it you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through and you sprinkle uh that those um toasted onion rings	3138	A
on top of it for the crunchy and that's it you know and it it it goes and it's filling because of the rice	3138	A
so	3138	A
uh-huh yeah	3138	A
yeah it gives it a an extra yeah little tang	3138	A
yeah that cholesterol fat free	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
uh-huh	3138	A
i know	3138	A
i don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
i know	3138	A
yeah we did the low-cal stuff well with my kids i don't they get enough sugar and stuff anyway mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway and they don't need any added help	3138	A
so when we're here at home	3138	A
you know with sweets and stuff they they don't we don't really do that much i do a lot of fruits	3138	A
instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that and and drink wise they have Kool-Aid milk or water normally now when they go to their grandmother's house	3138	A
which is every weekend it's a it's a different	3138	A
it's a different story all around	3138	A
uh-huh that's exactly what it is	3138	A
oh really	3138	A
no not yet	3138	A
huh	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
huh	3138	A
yeah	3138	A
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff	3138	A
okay i guess we're going to discuss food and cooking	3138	B
do you enjoy cooking	3138	B
i'm kind of that way too when i have i i enjoy cooking when i have time	3138	B
i don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday	3138	B
it gets kind of boring	3138	B
how big is the family you cook for	3138	B
uh-huh we have four so	3138	B
and two of them are teenage boys so	3138	B
are they	3138	B
yeah yeah we have that problem too but also now it's just the amount that they eat it's just absolutely incredible	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
does he well	3138	B
yeah that's true uh	3138	B
do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal	3138	B
favorite recipes that you've come across or	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
out on the grill uh-huh	3138	B
oh	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
ooh yeah	3138	B
ooh that's sound good i love that	3138	B
my husband really likes seafood	3138	B
um and uh i think that no matter what i do i don't serve enough of it really to uh to suit him i didn't grow up eating that much seafood	3138	B
and um so i don't know it's just kind of not natural to me but i like it and uh i don't know one of his favorite things is uh	3138	B
well it's called seafood stew and it's really it's really like a soup- soup that that you serve over rice	3138	B
and uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it and	3138	B
no no that's kind of Louisiana i think if you do that yeah i don't either	3138	B
but uh no this is just really- it is really good and and one thing that's good is it makes the a large amount and so i freeze- usually we eat one and i freeze two containers of it then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice	3138	B
but neither of my kids will eat it you know so then they eat a pizza or	3138	B
yeah it really does one thing i've run across	3138	B
recently though a friend gave me a recipe that i really like for chicken enchiladas have you made them	3138	B
does he ooh	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
well are these are done with a flour tortilla is that what he uses yeah	3138	B
isn't that something yeah	3138	B
i was going to say my kids both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for company too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time	3138	B
when i needed to make something to uh to give somebody you know like you know to take over to somebody's house or something else	3138	B
it it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family and then uh-huh	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
what what does it have in it	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
sure	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
uh-huh sure sometimes those are the best ones	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
yeah ooh that sounds good	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
oh yeah those are good aren't they uh-huh	3138	B
um	3138	B
that sounds good	3138	B
right	3138	B
you cook the rice before you put it in yeah	3138	B
i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good	3138	B
i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free	3138	B
yeah that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many	3138	B
new things like that because like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a low- low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing	3138	B
you know and now it's it's it's okay and you can even i used to just put a tiny bit in well now i'm just putting more and more in	3138	B
yeah and it's only it used to be like a hundred- hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's like twelve oh i just think that's the best thing to have happened i'm just so excited about that	3138	B
anyway	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
yes	3138	B
right	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3138	B
yeah	3138	B
uh-huh	3138	B
that's when they	3138	B
as our family would say a pig out huh	3138	B
that's good oh one of my boys that that's twelve um is has high cholesterol	3138	B
have you ever found out about your kids	3138	B
and my other one does not so oh year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down	3138	B
it's i think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol he's never eaten any eggs he's never had anything but skim milk and you know i've never bought butter and things like that but um	3138	B
oh he just left for the doctor again and it's it's kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh	3138	B
so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days	3138	B
so all that kind of stuff does really help well i think we've probably talked long enough and	3138	B
hi good morning do you have recycling in Sachse	3130	B
do	3130	B
oh really and it's twice a week	3130	B
really we have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up	3130	B
and now they have uh these large green containers	3130	B
and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet but they're but they're planning on doing it very soon apparently the trucks that they had	3130	B
um lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia and so that put off the program for a while but uh do you recycle	3130	B
do they uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
oh well that's great well that's the way we started too my daughter was going to Camp Goddard um which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall	3130	B
couple of years ago and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to babysit so that's how she started she started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers	3130	B
and uh aluminum cans and plastics uh-huh uh-huh	3130	B
no the- the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans um the rest of it we just do because	3130	B
my husband has become hooked on recycling and so you know we don't get paid for that but that's okay you know that- it's it's not that much of a bother really you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of two liter bottles	3130	B
um and like milk cartons and things like that it's amazing how much plastic you generate	3130	B
yeah yeah	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
yeah it really is well all that stuff and how much how much we have reduced	3130	B
our waste you know that we we're generating a week um	3130	B
i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week they were real upset but they weren't picking they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle	3130	B
you'll- you'll you know you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container and uh it's it's really amazing the other thing he does that my husband is a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings	3130	B
no he he got a little mulcher thing it's just a little attachment for the lawn mower	3130	B
and we mow once a week you know no no more often then that and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the um on the lawn	3130	B
and it's amazing it's amazing we don't collect any of that and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
yeah	3130	B
yeah	3130	B
sure it does sure it does it really does and it	3130	B
actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings that that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing	3130	B
yeah yeah	3130	B
uh-huh that's true that's true that's true	3130	B
well i i really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it	3130	B
it's it's really not that much trouble we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage	3130	B
and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near Wal-Mart they're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble	3130	B
and uh i feel like at least we're doing something	3130	B
you know uh um i read a book one time or a magazine- a magazine article and they said something about how	3130	B
you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but it's not if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save- save thousands and thousands of trees a day	3130	B
a day just from not throwing out your newspapers and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
yes	3130	B
yeah	3130	B
yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's really not necessary	3130	B
it really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so i'm excited about the recycling program in Plano i i can't wait for them to get it started	3130	B
um because that- it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked it up um	3130	B
now what what do they pick up it's just	3130	B
oh they do uh-huh and do you have to sort that or do you just put it all in	3130	B
right right right right so you're doing that now you're doing the newspapers and the glass oh uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
my husband would come home and go through the trash and say	3130	B
once you get into the habit of it it's okay it's just it's just making it a habit that's hard	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
uh-huh	3130	B
that's fun yeah yeah yeah oh that's a lot of fun that's a lot of fun well that's great well i'm glad to hear you're doing that	3130	B
i my sister was here recently from Connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans	3130	B
good morning	3130	A
yes we do we've got um a pickup twice a week that they come out and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it uh-huh	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
oh	3130	A
um uh my kids do put it that they they've been recycling cans for extra money so that's that's been their summer money and they're fixing to go to Disneyland so	3130	A
so yeah	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
really	3130	A
is is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they weigh it or whatever and	3130	A
um	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
yeah i was amazed at how many cans that we got uh because when the kids first went down i said that you know that's great and i was thinking you know maybe i'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in but	3130	A
its amazing how many cans you go through	3130	A
and how fast they accumulate	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
really	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
yeah well well- uh we don't ever- we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard so if it mows gets mowed i do it normally and i can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it it's too heavy	3130	A
so i just mow- i just mow it and leave it and it just soaks in	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
yeah oh i like it better doing it well one it cuts down on my mow time anyway and you zip through it quicker	3130	A
probably- we probably will	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
uh-huh	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
really	3130	A
what what makes me sick is is when they show the the dump sites	3130	A
you know and and how big they are or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river and they don't have any place to put it and it just floats in the and it's like ugh	3130	A
no	3130	A
yeah it it's it's convenient out here for them to do	3130	A
they pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper uh-huh	3130	A
and they will do the aluminum-	3130	A
no you just put it in the one bin and and i guess they do the sorting but um they'll do the aluminum cans too but we don't give them those the kids keep those so	3130	A
uh-huh well we don't we don't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home to- to read it so we don't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass	3130	A
at first when it first started it it it was hard you know because you're just used to throwing everything	3130	A
uh	3130	A
it is	3130	A
oh i know well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're oh no don't do that and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain and and then uh after a couple of days	3130	A
they take them all outside and i put them in a big bag anyway and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them so that's their activity thing they go out there and crush so	3130	A
yeah	3130	A
oh really	3130	A
all right now since i'm from the great	3274	A
Midwest north you know we're right on Lake Erie	3274	A
uh i'm sure our climates are much different than yours are	3274	A
typically today we've got uh rain we're forecasting a little bit of sleet	3274	A
and uh which means i'm not gonna do any lawn and gardening today that's for sure	3274	A
so i don't know what's the weather down there and	3274	A
uh-huh	3274	A
yeah	3274	A
yeah it's not	3274	A
are you really- we avoid having to send you a little bit	3274	A
uh-huh	3274	A
well i have that	3274	A
i still have that we have mums and geraniums that are still holding their own out there uh lot of the other ones i've i've already had to pull out	3274	A
uh at this point i'm ready to start putting in uh some bulbs i'm waiting for a decent some decent weather for that i got uh about_1 two hundred bulbs i've got to put in	3274	A
but i have a uh	3274	A
mine's a new home and we just really did the landscaping this year so i've got	3274	A
about all the gardening i want for the year so i'll be anxious to to let it rest for a little bit	3274	A
but uh somebody i talked to last week was said they had the uh they had problems doing some of the work down there because they they really had some heat hanging on	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
yeah all right	3274	A
uh-huh	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
oh i see	3274	A
uh-huh	3274	A
that's very okay it's very very different than ours because_1 ours ours we get into a lot of combinations of rye and Kentucky Blue	3274	A
and uh plus the usual amount of crabgrass weeds and everything else that pops through and	3274	A
uh but we've had an a terrible drought this year and everybody's going through the same kind of problems in fact we developed on a new lawn we developed what they call rust	3274	A
and it's a fungus which is very very rare but our whole area they're all new homes and new lawns and it was it was very	3274	A
very much in evidence this year as everything turns yellow	3274	A
well it just turns yellow where it shouldn't and you walk across walk across the lawn and your shoes will actually come out rust colored	3274	A
no it's it's a fungus and they claim that it is caused by stress to the lawn it it won't kill the lawn but it sure doesn't do much for the looks of the lawn	3274	A
and uh the alternative is a lot of uh nitrogen overpowering with nitrogen fertilizer and	3274	A
certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come spring- come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
oh yeah	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
you enjoy lawn work	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
yeah	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
yeah it sounds nice Cedar Lake i'm not uh	3274	A
oh i see-	3274	A
okay okay	3274	A
um-hum	3274	A
yeah that's interesting i never realized the uh the amount of lake	3274	A
yes i can understand	3274	B
oh it's nice and sunny here uh it's uh little- little Christmas uh crispness in the air	3274	B
and uh delightful to be outside	3274	B
and right now i'm watering	3274	B
yes	3274	B
and my lawn is very green and my flowers are still blooming	3274	B
oh you do	3274	B
um-hum	3274	B
uh-huh	3274	B
right	3274	B
uh-huh	3274	B
well course that's a constant factor down here what you have to do is uh keep your uh keep your ground uh watered	3274	B
and uh the heat really doesn't bother you if you have the right kind of flowers	3274	B
or and the right kind of lawn for that matter	3274	B
i have a tiff Bermuda lawn here and uh it -requires a lot of water and you have to keep it cut very short if you want it to look like a golf course green	3274	B
i don't uh get to it that often so mine doesn't look like a golf course course- but it is very nice and uh and shiny and uh very thin grass	3274	B
grows real close together	3274	B
um-hum	3274	B
turns yellow early huh	3274	B
and it's it's not it's not a disease- it's a disease and not a lack of a of chemicals	3274	B
huh	3274	B
um-hum	3274	B
well i have grub worms here off and on i try to keep them_1 under control they live right up under the surface of the ground and they eat the roots of your grass and then you have ground brown uh patches develop	3274	B
that's when you first notice it but you can put some uh chemical on that and kill them_1 out and keep them_1 under control you never destroy them_1	3274	B
oh very much so uh we have a lake house down at Cedar Creek Texas seventy five miles uh north uh or rather uh uh southeast- uh southeast of uh Dallas	3274	B
and uh i have to- to grow uh rye grass down there because we're not there to water although we have a watering system no one's there to turn it on and i guess uh	3274	B
well we don't have an automatic sprinkler either see so	3274	B
uh or automatic on the sprinkler system	3274	B
but uh you know the rye grass and the uh wild grass that grow makes us a nice lawn	3274	B
but	3274	B
oh it's a very large uh man-made lake uh in Texas it's about uh a hundred and uh fifty miles i guess in Fort Worth	3274	B
and it supplies Fort Worth with it's drinking water	3274	B
and then a hundred and eighty miles further south of there uh or rather a hundred and eighty miles from Fort Worth about	3274	B
forty miles south of Cedar Creek is another mammoth lake that Fort Worth owns	3274	B
that it uses to water	3274	B
probably so	3255	B
yeah it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
i think so too i'm in Texas and very few people carpool uh the people that i know don't want to because uh	3255	B
they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
um-hum that's right and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and	3255	B
to change the car itself but uh you know i- i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent but yeah	3255	B
well my other line is ringing but we're going to ignore it i'm sorry for these beeps	3255	B
oh a close to five minutes i believe and you're in Minneapolis well is the pollution really bad up there	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
yeah	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
that's the way it has gotten here we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in Texas	3255	B
but uh i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them_1 for that and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed	3255	B
and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the CFCs that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use	3255	B
uh they can't use like i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business	3255	B
and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of Freon that they use in the air conditioning systems- systems	3255	B
therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty two Freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed	3255	B
and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of Freons that do not release as many CFCs into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much	3255	B
so eventually people are gonna have to go to newer systems you know but	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
right	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
hm	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
it's probably happened to millions of people um-hum	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
um-hum	3255	B
yeah	3255	B
inhaled so much of it um-hum	3255	B
yeah well of course in the uh i'd think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt you-	3255	B
okay for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance that's probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car	3255	A
and uh whether or not um they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train or or something like that or park	3255	A
yeah that's exactly it and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in Minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are	3255	A
inconveniences to that or maybe you don't like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing so it's it's kind of a thing where uh i think the majority of the people do not carpool	3255	A
um-hum	3255	A
yeah	3255	A
exactly	3255	A
uh-huh or if somebody gets sick yeah or if somebody gets sick and it's not the other person and they want to go home and that one person's got the car then they're they're stuck you're definitely right so	3255	A
yes	3255	A
um-hum	3255	A
sure oops sure that happens quite a bit	3255	A
five minutes oh okay Minneapolis area	3255	A
uh actually no we have uh quite a bit uh the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get more pollutants such as those but those are natural	3255	A
um but there is starting to in Minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict	3255	A
law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead	3255	A
into the air the air or other pollutants and if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed at least you can't	3255	A
sure yeah	3255	A
yeah it's not a bad idea	3255	A
um-hum	3255	A
sure sure	3255	A
exactly	3255	A
um-hum	3255	A
sure	3255	A
uh-huh	3255	A
uh-huh	3255	A
sure	3255	A
uh-huh	3255	A
sure	3255	A
uh-huh	3255	A
yeah	3255	A
sure uh the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning i'm sure over there it's it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it but it's uncomfortable	3255	A
but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the uh	3255	A
into the air because he opened it and i don't know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that and i was thinking how many other people	3255	A
oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price	3255	A
because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey that's that's right there i think it's like three or four dollars a a can	3255	A
but uh you think about that all the people that are using freon and things like that and	3255	A
uh-huh	3255	A
exactly	3255	A
pump yeah	3255	A
um-hum	3280	B
um-hum	3280	B
um-hum	3280	B
um we do take the Dallas Morning News and	3280	B
um-hum	3280	B
uh-huh	3280	B
yeah	3280	B
yeah	3280	B
yeah if there's something you know that i want to know more about or something- might be the Killeen murders i've been kind of intrigued i guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone you just	3280	B
yeah yeah	3280	B
right	3280	B
yeah- oh yeah yeah	3280	B
that's true i wanted a little more detail like- you know they would tell more about the people that were killed where they were from and how old they were and i guess you just you know you	3280	B
you just want to know and with interest you know found some people that were members of our church which was different that- that made you even feel a little more kin to to what was going on	3280	B
well you know of the same same type of church that we belong to uh-huh yeah so that made it a little more and that they were from Utah also so	3280	B
so that was interesting but i enjoy the news i i think our seven year old even once in a while will sit down and watch it with us so	3280	B
no	3280	B
uh-huh	3280	B
huh	3280	B
uh-huh	3280	B
right	3280	B
yeah	3280	B
yeah that's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that	3280	B
right	3280	B
right	3280	B
oh do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it or	3280	B
do you uh channel five for some reason has always been the one i've watched i i don't know it's probably the anchors they just kind of catch you i don't i don't know	3280	B
uh-huh	3280	B
the CNN is that what that is	3280	B
huh	3280	B
oh	3280	B
yeah	3280	B
yeah	3280	B
yeah that's why i wondered i don't get that channel yeah	3280	B
yeah yeah that is if you- if you want to go to bed early it's nice to to to watch that early news sometimes but	3280	B
okay um	3280	A
i very seldom read a newspaper i get most of my news information from TV mainly um if i'm really wanting an indepth thing i'll watch CNN	3280	A
and i find it one of the best and uh otherwise it's just one of the regular uh channels eight or five and uh where do you get yours	3280	A
uh-huh	3280	A
um-hum well i take the Dallas Morning News and and my husband uh	3280	A
he reads it cover to cover and uh if he thinks there's something that i need to know about he'll say you know here you need to read this and uh	3280	A
i don't know it i kind of quit reading it oh i don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers it just seems like i was so busy all the time and if i wanted to read i wanted to read something light and relaxing and	3280	A
and uh things like that and so i could- and it got so depressing seems like it wasn't anything but bad news	3280	A
but i find- find that i do better with oh remembering it and everything if i watch uh	3280	A
the TV you know and and they kind of capsize it and everything and watch and i think sometimes it's you know	3280	A
maybe a little biased you know in- some things and sometimes you don't you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts you know	3280	A
yes yes	3280	A
you found some members of your church that had been murdered	3280	A
oh the same type of church uh-huh uh-huh	3280	A
oh uh-huh uh-huh	3280	A
um-hum i used to uh uh i didn't used to but uh when my grandchildren had uh have stayed over before and	3280	A
even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level	3280	A
and i thought that was very interesting and i thought that was very- very important for kids they they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on	3280	A
uh in the war they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know that they could understand what was going on and uh	3280	A
i noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that the oldest one he's nine and uh he would particularly enjoy this been a couple of years ago and uh	3280	A
i thought i think that's really interesting actually i even understood it better yeah	3280	A
i have kind of a blase attitude about um news and news reporting which is is not good you you know nobody should get that way about the news and what's going on in the world	3280	A
yes we like channel eight we like it it's the best	3280	A
is that been your favorite uh-huh	3280	A
yeah i very seldom- and i thought it was very interesting um	3280	A
channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen and and going on they were having news coverage and	3280	A
no it was channel nine and you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening and so we had the TV on and we were trying to catch all of it and they were showing some	3280	A
and i was watching my husband and i were watching it and then we switched over to channel	3280	A
eight and the difference in coverage was unbelievable i can understand why channel eleven is uh	3280	A
you know why they're kind of behind did i say channel nine to begin with no okay no channel channel eleven i meant i was thinking nine to ten but channel eleven	3280	A
uh-huh it uh but the coverage wasn't near as good as as when we you know switched over to channel eight and they didn't	3280	A
okay_1 do you have any	3252	B
hm	3252	B
did it work	3252	B
no right i um i had a for many years i had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel i just love them	3252	B
her name was Molly but she isn't alive anymore we had her for hm fifteen years i think my family did and just	3252	B
loved her she was the greatest greatest um went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle	3252	B
yeah i have a cat now he just turned seven also and he's i um got him in Arizona and when i used to live there and he is huge he is eighteen pounds	3252	B
just um i got him he was um he was born in the wild like in a in a shed	3252	B
and had never been in a building when i got him so he and he's he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because_1 he's very long and lanky but he's a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that i've had him for seven years	3252	B
no no he's yeah he's great and uh he's uh he's really spoiled though so but he's	3252	B
really big so lots of times he it he he seems to get in fights and when he was younger i think he started them and now i think he barely makes it i think he gets beat up even though he's big because_1 he's	3252	B
pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then yeah	3252	B
oh i've seen them i	3252	B
yeah i have seen them they um weren't they they were actually i can't remember they were used to be used on ships	3252	B
and in for for mousers you know so they're very nautical too	3252	B
yeah i just uh i think i'm i think i'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore but i'm not sure	3252	B
yeah	3252	B
yeah	3252	B
yeah i'd love to go to a cat show i'm real like- a real cat lover i'd i'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let us- let me he doesn't really like mine let alone another one so	3252	B
yeah okay	3252	B
hm	3252	B
i know what you mean	3252	B
sure i have a Springer Spaniel and her name is Thumper she's about seven or eight years old	3252	A
i got her for Christmas from my family and uh back when we lived in Nebraska i like to hunt and uh so	3252	A
i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like Thumper that boy i could just go out and get all kinds of game yeah except we live in Plano Texas now so	3252	A
do you have a pet now	3252	A
oh	3252	A
what kind of cat is it	3252	A
uh-huh	3252	A
being born outside you didn't have any problems house training them	3252	A
that's good	3252	A
sure	3252	A
and older	3252	A
well we went to a uh cat show at the Plano Center here in town and uh we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique so	3252	A
we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the uh Maine Coon cats	3252	A
they're huge	3252	A
oh	3252	A
i'll be darned i didn't know that	3252	A
well- that's interesting we kind of like well my family didn't necessarily like like them as much as i did but the Manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but	3252	A
well i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog and then i suppose our five minutes will be up huh i uh	3252	A
work for a university and i went to uh Omaha Nebraska to recruit students and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a a pet shop	3252	A
and i saw these little Springer Spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to Carney Nebraska	3252	A
i told my wife about it and i said you know this is just a i- i can just hear the dog crying for me now and and Christmas is coming up you know hint hint and so	3252	A
i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people uh that we went with uh they were friends of ours and so	3252	A
we uh got to Omaha and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog and	3252	A
so i got over there and she said oh that's too bad the dog has already been sold and i didn't realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room	3252	A
and uh so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students and	3252	A
and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room and and i had no idea and so we headed back to Carney that night and	3252	A
the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and i guess while we were inside eating	3252	A
Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car and uh finally we made it back to uh to Carney and	3252	A
okay i don't do you have a opinion on that on the USSR	3272	A
uh-huh	3272	A
sure	3272	A
um-hum sure	3272	A
sure	3272	A
sure that happens	3272	A
uh-huh	3272	A
sure i guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot	3272	A
go into a war uh they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together but i could not foresee them severing what they have with the US	3272	A
um because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation um from what i've been hearing is the USSR- uh -USSR has been uh almost bankrupt	3272	A
for years and it's people are desperate and there might be a revolution within the people but i don't think the US would get involved with it because uh there's too close of ties to where	3272	A
i think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run	3272	A
them like we run the US and that they have to make their own independent decision so i guess i really have no fear at all of the USSR verses uh you get these small little uh places like Iraq and all of that that	3272	A
might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons versus a a small	3272	A
uh or the big country of USSR i- i- i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would	3272	A
totally you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time	3272	A
so i mean sure they have weapons to kill us over and over and over but	3272	A
to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people but if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of	3272	A
you know doing whatever uh for their country they'll do it uh	3272	A
sure sure	3272	A
um-hum sure i have a daughter that's frustrated she's on a a stool that she can get up on but it- if she can't get down on it it's like get me down right now but anyway it was really good talking to you and you have a good weekend	3272	A
uh-huh thank you bye now	3272	A
well the i think i'm i'm skeptical about the whole thing uh and a little- still a little bit worried about them_1 because of the history- the history of Russia	3272	B
and they're in a in a state of flux right now changing uh you- uh changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress	3272	B
and even in that situation uh the it seems like to me from what i've read in in the history of Russia and and you know different authors	3272	B
uh there has always been a paranoia they've always suspected everybody and and that's why they put you know that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years and that's why they put a lot of people to death	3272	B
yeah Stalin- Stalin was a was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than uh you know the Russian army killed anybody else	3272	B
yeah	3272	B
sure	3272	B
yeah	3272	B
yeah you're uh i think you're right there's a little more craziness down there	3272	B
uh the Russian people i think are not that much different from us you know i think they're that it would be the leadership that i'd i'd uh mistrust	3272	B
yeah	3272	B
you to thank you bye-bye	3272	B
well i did hear the end of the prompt this time was that you that we didn't hear the whole prompt and it said that what what do we do we think that crime- certain crimes should fit certain punishments	3256	A
and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way	3256	A
to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that that uh those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment too often i feel that people get off uh	3256	A
without	3256	A
um-hum	3256	A
um-hum	3256	A
right right	3256	A
yeah	3256	A
um-hum	3256	A
yeah well sometimes they even wonder when when uh criminals plead temporary insanity	3256	A
for for punishment- for crimes that are so severe and then you know they get sent to a mental institution and they play loony for a while and then they're back out in public	3256	A
yeah	3256	A
yeah oh i agree i agree because we	3256	A
um-hum	3256	A
yeah yeah well and too you know they can always be blaming the other person well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is	3256	A
unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse i guess you know a lot of and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and	3256	A
is that the new i just happened to see the headline on it and i didn't couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what but i thought uh	3256	A
you know if these things if children are being abused i i'm wondering how our school system is failing that they're not even seeing this	3256	A
you know if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger	3256	A
and that kind of that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having you know to to deal with that yet but still	3256	A
never and i lived in California which i feel like California you know anything can go on in California	3256	A
yeah	3256	A
um-hum um-hum	3256	A
i really would have no idea	3256	A
i uh i don't don't really know	3256	A
um-hum that would be pretty lenient in my opinion	3256	A
yeah that's that or like when uh i've heard when i	3256	A
yes yes	3256	B
um-hum	3256	B
yeah i- i agree with you although i will say i'm not sure you know i sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people	3256	B
who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was was because they were abused abused- abused as children and the parents are saying hey wait a minute we didn't do anything like that you know and	3256	B
and and	3256	B
i guess before i'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it has to be a an absolute certainty	3256	B
you know with with i don't buy the routine oh they're just sick or they were abused when they were little well well you know forget that	3256	B
um-hum	3256	B
well but i can't see that either i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent again- uh you know reason to not use capital punishment	3256	B
i think uh i think if i wanted to badly enough i could convince somebody	3256	B
uh i was crazy so my family may say that on occasion who knows you know uh i- i don't think it's that hard to do	3256	B
you know to to convince somebody that uh gee you just had no control over what you were doing	3256	B
um-hum	3256	B
um-hum	3256	B
that's the new one	3256	B
well you you're right uh and yet i mean did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this no	3256	B
oh well	3256	B
yes- well yes i but i was from conservative Wisconsin and uh you know there was there was nothing on it which makes me wonder you know if it's as uh prevalent as as some of them claim	3256	B
it uh it it it's	3256	B
you just don't know and it all you know unless they're caught in the act or the the the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other	3256	B
you know type thing now Texas is capital punishment for it used to be just capital murder and now they- they added mass murder are those the only two things that we uh	3256	B
uh you know because_1 i have a feeling it is and i- i think there ought to be more things added to it uh if you	3256	B
yeah i- i think that's i you know uh killing a child uh kidnapping	3256	B
uh and possibly not well	3256	B
i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know if they release them two hours later he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty	3256	B
um i i do i play tennis and softball and i do a little bit of woodworking around the house furniture stripping and stuff like that	3224	B
uh well i have this uh huge kitchen cabinet that uh it was like an old cabinet my buildings from was built in nineteen oh four	3224	B
so i have this cabinet that had about eight layers of paint on it and i stripped it down and i'm still working on it for about it's been about a year that i've been working on it	3224	B
it's beautiful moldings and a beautiful cabinet and as soon as i'm done with it it should be good	3224	B
we use like a heat gun to strip it and then uh chemicals to get the rest of the paint out of the crevices and stuff like that	3224	B
yeah yeah it's it's it's uh it's probably movable the cabinet but it would be tough to move i was able to take some of the pieces apart it's like a kitchen pantry basically	3224	B
i was able to take some of the pieces apart like some of the shelves out to clean them out independently and stuff	3224	B
yeah a little too ambitious	3224	B
no i'd done nothing like it before but a neighbor of ours had done this and it looked uh looked nice so we figured we'd try it ourselves	3224	B
um a little bit she didn't tell us she did say it was gonna be hard work she was right she was right	3224	B
so uh what kind of work do you do you do any you don't you do anything like that or what are your hobbies	3224	B
really	3224	B
crossword- you do crossword puzzles mostly or or	3224	B
right	3224	B
is that what you do for a living or you do other things	3224	B
huh grand	3224	B
fantastic	3224	B
are you from Texas	3224	B

and her address is two twenty five	3224	B
West End Avenue	3224	B
hobbies do you have	3224	A
ah	3224	A
do you do antiques	3224	A
oh	3224	A
oh my	3224	A
ah	3224	A
do you do all this in your house	3224	A
oh	3224	A
uh-huh	3224	A
oh	3224	A
boy that's an ambitious project	3224	A
had you ever done any refinishing before	3224	A
oh	3224	A
so the neighbor was able to give you guidance	3224	A
yeah and she was right	3224	A
yes	3224	A
well uh i do a lot of needlework	3224	A
and i also do puzzles for magazines i get paid for this i've written two puzzle books	3224	A
uh-huh and so in my free time even though it's not a hobby and that i do get paid for it i'm always developing new puzzles and activities and and word games mind benders that type of thing	3224	A
no they're they're variety type puzzles	3224	A
uh not crosswords just all different kinds find the hidden word and um you know anagram type puzzles acrostic cryptograms	3224	A
uh mostly for children but some of them go up through grade twelve	3224	A
so and i've developed a lot of my own type of puzzles like word snakes and grid graphs and things like that so that's what published so if i have free time i'm usually sitting down with uh graph paper doing some puzzles	3224	A
i'm a writer for a living i write other things i'm a freelance writer	3224	A
and uh i was a teacher for fourteen years and i'm not teaching because we've had to move around so much that i	3224	A
no	3224	A
i- i live in Texas now but i'm from Southern Ohio originally	3224	A
and uh we've lived in Michigan and it seems like wherever i go i need to take forty hours of college in order to update my teaching credentials	3224	A
so i decided i didn't want that to be my hobby any more after paying thousands and then moving the next year so um now i'm i'm just writing at home	3224	A
yes	3224	A
oh and what does she edit	3224	A
oh	3224	A
yes ABA	3224	A
oh	3224	A
uh-huh that's right i knew some people going up there	3224	A
oh well that	3224	A
oh great	3224	A
no i don't think so so does she take in manuscripts like fiction to edit	3224	A
because i'm in a a large writers group here in Dallas called Dallas Area Romance Authors do you live in the Dallas area	3224	A
oh you're from New York oh well there's a large group there too it's a national thing Romance Writers of America and they're always looking for freelance editors	3224	A
okay i can send her some information about it because i know they mail manuscripts and	3224	A
for a complete- oh i think it's three chapters and a synopsis which would be around sixty pages the average price is around a hundred and fifty dollars for an editorial service	3224	A
so okay i'll write this down and send it	3224	A
oh good	3224	A
yeah	3224	A
okay let me take down the information and i'll send her who to who to send her credentials to	3224	A
okay	3224	A
two twenty five	3224	A
okay well basically i am a mother of a three year old so i can- kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's uh	3208	A
extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child uh trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that and uh i've been pretty selective and what i'm finding is with um	3208	A
day cares that are like day care centers like for instance uh Learning Tree or KinderCare and all of that what i find is that they're highly structured highly organized	3208	A
almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time	3208	A
uh like nap time or whatever time uh because of parents' hours they are differ and when i bring my daughter into a such a system like that uh	3208	A
they only have one thing going on that's nap time everybody's napping whether they came there an hour before or they came at- right during that time and with that kind of a system my daughter	3208	A
just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down on a cot so um home day care has been an option and i've looked into that the only thing is you raise the question of	3208	A
is it safe uh can you trust the people you know um	3208	A
sure oh sure sure that's really scary and to the point that you kind of say to yourself especially_1 home day care i mean i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out	3208	A
that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it's fine it depends on the age of the child now some children do real well that are at the age of	3208	A
four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while but home teaching- home day care works well if it's an infant if it's	3208	A
if it's if you wanna have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided because_1 i've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids the kids have	3208	A
colds and they're sick all the time and the	3208	A
uh-huh	3208	B
right	3208	B
um-hum	3208	B
uh-huh	3208	B
um-hum	3208	B
um-hum	3208	B
that's right and you never know i have um	3208	B
an ex-sister-in-law that um currently has a child abuse case on a home babysitter	3208	B
uh-huh	3208	B
right	3208	B
right	3208	B
um-hum	3208	B
right	3208	B
okay let's talk about schooling	3216	A
okay well i have a boy and he just went into middle school early and i have a girl and she's in uh grade school	3216	A
and then i have a little boy who goes to uh they have something just before kindergarten and it's called Early Childhood and i have a young a young boy in that	3216	A
so i- i have a lot of children in in the school system down here	3216	A
and um i think we have excellent teachers here i am really uh like the students- like the way the teachers work with the students	3216	A
uh i've not been so um	3216	A
happy with the schools themselves i guess like my last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school and it was just packed	3216	A
i mean it was a a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents	3216	A
and it was just a real problem uh so we had to do a bond issue and and um	3216	A
vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what they preferred to do	3216	A
or to uh work on the school- work for another school to be built	3216	A
which is a good idea but in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it	3216	A
so um i think one thing is that would maybe we don't have enough schools and secondly when we have enough schools	3216	A
sometimes we can't get the the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers	3216	A
oh	3216	A
uh-huh	3216	A
oh great	3216	A
we see through the out the country name	3216	A
um-hum i think that's right	3216	A
yeah	3216	A
the home yeah	3216	A
uh i think that's right	3216	A
it is so hard with a family system um either divorced or or just one parent or just	3216	A
uh like- and then if both of them_1 have to work even that is a a hard situation	3216	A
for the children uh to to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them	3216	A
and i think it's really important that the parents work with the school um	3216	A
i think what you said is is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts from what's happening in the school	3216	A
so um well what about your wife is she she happy at school or she's just ready	3216	A
oh i bet she does	3216	A
um-hum	3216	A
yeah	3216	A
right right	3216	A
uh-huh	3216	A
yeah	3216	A
right	3216	A
yeah uh what- what what contacts do you have with uh public school system-	3216	B
oh okay um-hum	3216	B
um-hum	3216	B
um-hum	3216	B
yeah	3216	B
yeah yeah	3216	B
well i think that's i think that's uh true i i've got a a little different uh contact but i've i've got a one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a	3216	B
a sophomore this year and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson ah but	3216	B
in general i i think that the you know one of the reasons that we we uh	3216	B
the choice to live in Richardson when we when we came here was the was the schools and i think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the uh	3216	B
uh things seriously wrong with the public schools are are not nearly to the extent that that	3216	B
and right right and i think and i think part of that is that is the the uh your big part of that is just uh the demographics the population in those schools are are	3216	B
typically uh people that very much value the education and support the the school systems and and uh	3216	B
although there is still some still some problems but uh	3216	B
i i- you know i when- when i was when i was going to school and i grew up in Iowa and and we- in my family school was certainly valued but if there was ever any sort of a uh	3216	B
if ever- if i was ever in trouble in school i was also in trouble at home and and- even more so and i think that that part of it is is not	3216	B
exactly with the schools but with the with the uh	3216	B
the culture that doesn't doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support uh	3216	B
what the schools are are trying to do	3216	B
yeah that's true	3216	B
um-hum	3216	B
um-hum	3216	B
yeah	3216	B
yeah	3216	B
yeah	3216	B
well uh she she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher she- she has she has two half day classes so she has uh	3216	B
you know on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades and uh uh	3216	B
but her her background is in is in uh	3216	B
child development and and uh so forth and so kindergarten is as high as she as she wants to teach and she's she's teaching rather than something else because_1 that that	3216	B
that's the jobs that are available and that the schedule matches uh you know with our kids and things like that so	3216	B
yeah uh and but uh the	3216	B
one of the hardest things in finding child care is deciding to let go what do you think	3298	A
well like going back to work and uh it seems like parents have a very difficult time especially mothers have a very difficult time in uh	3298	A
finding someone well first off in going back to work they uh with the little babies and then then finding someone that satisfies them	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
yes	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
oh yeah and help help with the housework a little bit	3298	A
the the best one i ever had was uh when i had only one child and	3298	A
uh was an infant and it was an older woman and she came to the house and uh she had noon meal cooked and my husband and i came home and ate and everything	3298	A
well of course it was extra special for us because_1 he was a student and i had to work so uh that really helped	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
oh yes	3298	A
i don't either well a lot of mothers have had to quit work because of that	3298	A
you get one or two children one child and could be fifty to seventy five dollars a week	3298	A
and then you get two and it just multiplies	3298	A
oh	3298	A
yeah	3298	A
that's true study time and uh if they watch television it's educational only or you know monitor that don't just turn them_1 loose on it	3298	A
oh no huh-uh	3298	A
you found someone in the neighborhood if you were lucky yeah	3298	A
it	3298	A
have you had any experience with people who have chosen nannies	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
well i'm i do the kind kind of work we	3298	A
we do medical checkups on some who are going to be nannies and the criteria they're using are they want they they require them to have certain blood tests and	3298	A
as well as their educational requirements and	3298	A
the one nannies i've talked to who bring the children in are very very uh	3298	A
oh enthusiastic about what they're doing with them_1 and	3298	A
um they present themselves well but that's as as close as i've come to them	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
oh yes	3298	A
right	3298	A
well the only i think the one good thing about day care of course i'm in the grandchildren age and one of my grandchildren needed the day care because he needed to the other	3298	A
uh other uh younger children he needed to learn to share	3298	A
he was uh his mother couldn't get two feet from him	3298	A
and uh they're hoping that that helps on that course that may be just the age	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
um-hum	3298	A
yes	3298	A
well good good course what really helps is when you know you have to right	3298	A
now what do you mean by letting go	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
right right well um gosh my kids are older now so i feel like that that my uh choices are are different now when i first	3298	B
when i first went back to work uh you're right i- i wanted to have somebody who came into the house and who performed you know certain functions and that closeness and i noticed that as the older they got	3298	B
you know the less and less picky i got about that um uh that criteria	3298	B
uh but you know now uh you know i wish there was somebody not so much to babysit the kids but tutor them_1 in homework really really so but	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
oh see that would've been wonderful	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3298	B
oh yeah yeah yeah those uh those people who can uh stay you know home and and take care of the kids and uh you know do that i think are really special people	3298	B
um so you just don't find that anymore um even now the the day cares though are so expensive	3298	B
that um i don't know how parents afford them uh	3298	B
right right	3298	B
oh yeah i-	3298	B
um-hum yeah i- i think it's gone up to like a hundred dollars a week and depending on on what age they are	3298	B
and uh you know if you want quality day care to where they have uh not only just their meals taken care of those basic necessities but also uh their education too	3298	B
um-hum because	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
oh yeah oh yeah so it's a i- i think it's changed over the years	3298	B
um but you know i found uh like i said they at least when my kids were growing up that uh it was harder especially companies didn't have programs to where they would help you find babysitters yeah	3298	B
um-hum that's right that's right and um-hum	3298	B
no- no but you know i've read um you know some stories uh about that and uh so now now i don't do you know of anybody	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
yeah	3298	B
yeah no i had just you know read in a uh oh i don't know the the want columns um but i guess when i had thought about it since i've been a single parent for so long that uh you know i wished i had the money for something like that	3298	B
because of the special um	3298	B
oh i don't know the um the special closeness that bond that's formed versus taking them to a day care where they just they're one of many children	3298	B
yeah so that's a that's to me it's extra special	3298	B
um-hum	3298	B
sure sure	3298	B
right right	3298	B
yeah it it could be age but you know i- i can never regret uh the children	3298	B
uh going through that day care experience because they learned so many things uh such as responsibility independence	3298	B
uh you know that sharing i mean there are a lot of good things i- i know there's a lot of drawbacks to women going back to to work	3298	B
but um i think there was so many positives that that i saw	3298	B
um that i- i really didn't have that much guilt about it	3298	B
yeah that made it real easy but i- i	3298	B
my name's Mary Dell and i live in the Dallas Texas area where there's a lot of pollution	3244	B
oh uh-huh	3244	B
yes	3244	B
okay	3244	B
oh	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
ooh	3244	B
right	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
oh gosh	3244	B
um-hum um-hum	3244	B
huh i'd never thought about that being a cause i have to dust a lot as well	3244	B
yeah	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
my goodness	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
that's kind of the way Dallas is we're so flat and open and i live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation trees it was all cotton fields so	3244	B
we don't have that advantage and ours i think is primarily cars where we don't carpool like we should	3244	B
an airport i work in a building i'm nineteen floors up and i look out toward DFW International and there's just an awful brown haze all the time	3244	B
and i can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
yes	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
um-hum want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
but we're paying for it	3244	B
um-hum	3244	B
and it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up	3244	B
you can really see it i- i had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago and of course there's no industry	3244	B
very little trash they they don't even have that much that they burn because they consume everything down to the thread and it amazed me i- i just had totally forgotten how blessed-	3244	B
okay and i'm up in Wisconsin uh my name is Terry	3244	A
and uh in the small town we don't but uh we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution-	3244	A
okay i'll go ahead and start recording that	3244	A
okay um just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations and um i'm sure there's a lot of pollution we uh before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were um	3244	A
gravel pits and also where they were making tar and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar and	3244	A
it would uh smell the continuous you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs so and it was like miles away but just the idea of having that	3244	A
come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that but	3244	A
also um where we also lived too it was very close to a highway so we got a lot of fumes from uh trucks	3244	A
and cars and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture i mean it was on your tables you would dust every day and it was dirty um	3244	A
type of uh dust i mean it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country	3244	A
um	3244	A
i live in a small um town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities about an hour away and i may dust once a week and that's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city	3244	A
so	3244	A
oh yeah it it comes right on through through the screens the only way that you could	3244	A
actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house	3244	A
and so it was quite a dirty city um if- if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution	3244	A
then you're fine but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not	3244	A
catching the pollution and it's just going for miles and miles and miles and it's landing somewhere with the wind but	3244	A
sure	3244	A
sure	3244	A
yes yes	3244	A
uh-huh	3244	A
uh-huh	3244	A
oh sure sure yeah it's i mean our air quality um	3244	A
in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in	3244	A
the other areas but um they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever and it's kind of scary because the- air is something we take for granted	3244	A
and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend even	3244	A
my husband was uh talking to some of the guys at work now he's uh fifteen miles away from work but he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool and the guy says well it's too close it wouldn't pay and so	3244	A
yeah and	3244	A
exactly- exactly and so my husband says well that's fine you know it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas	3244	A
and no everybody has their preference to drive by themselves or if they do they	3244	A
they drive with one little buddy uh at least it's with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it i don't want to carpool it's too much of a hassle it's too much involvement but yet	3244	A
yes we are and i think of my daughter and i'm sure you think of your children and you kind of say to yourself	3244	A
what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and i think people are trying	3244	A
but they have to change attitudes	3244	A
um-hum	3244	A
sure	3244	A
um-hum	3244	A
sure	3244	A
sure	3244	A
well they	3244	A
yeah got uh four	3249	B
yeah uh let's see uh fourteen twelve	3249	B
five and one and a half i was yeah how about you	3249	B
seven year old okay i've got one boy the oldest one's a boy and the three others are are girls	3249	B
no huh-uh no she um my wife stays home	3249	B
yeah how about you- how about yourself	3249	B
do you huh	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
um-hum	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
um-hum	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
so what would you what is there a certain ratio that would scare you off or of teachers to kids	3249	B
uh-huh	3249	B
uh-huh	3249	B
so you're talking now- now you're pretty well limited to to home care then someone someone taking your your your kid into their home yeah	3249	B
uh-huh	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
uh-huh	3249	B
um-hum um i guess i ideally um uh i would if i if my wife had to go to work we'd probably look for a home where the ratio of of uh	3249	B
um adults to children was was you know low and i don't think you won't find that in a in a commercially run day care what was that beep	3249	B
did you	3249	B
you didn't	3249	B
so do i	3249	B
okay	3249	B
um what so what what were we saying that um	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
yeah because_1 how can you um you know did you see the did you see the um i think it was on it was either Twenty Twenty or 60 Minutes about that the day care in Louisiana	3249	B
and it looked when the parents visited it looked like um that everything looked fine and they told them one ratio of adults to kids and and and that appeared to be what what the case when they were there but then	3249	B
then uh it turned out that uh so how do you protect yourself against that i wonder	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
uh-huh	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
well we've been my wife has stayed home uh fourteen years now and it yeah it's not always been easy	3249	B
um to do because there are many times when another salary would be real helpful	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
yeah	3249	B
uh-huh	3249	B
um-hum	3249	B
um-hum	3249	B
yeah my wife worked at a has worked at a couple of those too and she's never	3249	B
never been uh um satisfied with with uh with what the children were were getting and and and then she worked um not to long ago for just	3249	B
filling in she filled in at a real large commercial commercially run where there were like i don't know how many kids there were but it was twenty kids in a room and i don't know how many adults they had but um	3249	B
so	3249	B
okay um do you have children of your own	3249	A
oh you do what ages are they	3249	A
oh my you- sound like a busy parent	3249	A
i have two a seven year old and three and a half mine are both girls	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
oh do you and your wife both work	3249	A
well that's nice i	3249	A
i stay home too yeah to me that's the ideal situation but i did work part-time when i had just one child and uh i'm pretty picky about my criteria of child care i	3249	A
i don't care too much for day care centers and preschool well you know schools where the children stay all day long	3249	A
and so i- i think the thing that i would think was most important is is if they're getting that individual attention that they need from an adult and i don't think they get enough of it	3249	A
yeah mine's pretty low too uh the lady that i left my daughter with only kept only had two other children besides my daughter so three to one i felt comfortable with	3249	A
i think if it got much more than that i would start feeling like someone was gonna be left out	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
right i don't think- well i think once my uh child got to be maybe four years old i might feel a little better about a larger group setting	3249	A
but up until that time both of my girls had such passive personalities that if they had been around a whole lot of other children i really think they would have been	3249	A
you know taken for granted some of the other kids would have pushed them_1 around and um probably taken advantage of them a little bit what do you think	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
no	3249	A
no	3249	A
oh i didn't even hear one no it might have been i have call waiting but if so i'll just try later that's fine	3249	A
yeah you said that uh you would like if your wife had to go back to work you probably would prefer that they stayed in a home	3249	A
oh yeah	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
right	3249	A
yeah i don't know see i feel real sorry for couples where both people are you know have to work to make ends meet because you're kind of	3249	A
you know stuck there i- i know that um if i had to go to work right now i would really have a hard time finding someone	3249	A
because i babysitters are just really hard to come by and- especially real good ones and you know ones that uh don't keep that many children and give them_1 the individual attention that i think they need and that kind of thing	3249	A
so i would really be hard pressed to find something that i felt like was quality child care	3249	A
so i don't know i feel real sorry for you know working moms that are really looking hard and trying to do a good job with their kids	3249	A
i'm just thankful i'm able to stay home it makes the choice a lot easier	3249	A
wow that's great	3249	A
oh i know	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
yeah oh yeah we feel that way i mean even now it's really hard to make ends meet even with two children so i can imagine with four	3249	A
but you learn how to to stretch money how to use hand-me-downs and that kind of thing really makes a big difference too	3249	A
but i don't know i uh i worked at a little preschool it was a private one you know like a church sponsored type thing where it was only two days a week Tuesday and Thursday from like nine till two	3249	A
and even that i was not totally satisfied with the way the kids were treated uh	3249	A
uh-huh	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
um-hum	3249	A
oh	3249	A
yeah	3249	A
she didn't	3249	A
well i don't know if there's gonna be a solutions to the US budget	3270	A
um-hum	3270	A
yes exactly	3270	A
there's uh maybe some short term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um i know that state	3270	A
has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh	3270	A
the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition that	3270	A
uh state of Minnesota	3270	A
so there's the potential that perhaps	3270	A
you know the US budget might wanna take a look at it's uh federal	3270	A
employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze	3270	A
wages i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a short that's got to be very short term	3270	A
and- and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as	3270	A
saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh	3270	A
for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them_1 four hundred five hundred dollars	3270	A
so it gives you an idea that	3270	A
sure sure so	3270	A
uh-huh	3270	A
uh-huh	3270	A
than we think sure	3270	A
sure	3270	A
yeah	3270	A
um-hum it sure is the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually	3270	A
uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences they were using it as eating out um when you think about people	3270	A
uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that and it's a real big crunch	3270	A
uh of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are um spending money that does not belong to them	3270	A
um-hum	3270	A
sure	3270	A
um-hum	3270	A
exactly and i- i don't think uh it's ended up being i mean it gave people jobs	3270	A
but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use i mean it was kind of like okay we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's	3270	A
you know um they didn't wanna do it anymore	3270	A
so a lot of things that they're saying that they're no longer gonna be doing for	3270	A
next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things so	3270	A
i don't know okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening	3270	A
uh-huh thanks bye now	3270	A
well i know it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure	3270	B
it's only getting worse exponentially it seems um	3270	B
um-hum	3270	B
oh which state is that	3270	B
uh-huh	3270	B
um-hum	3270	B
right	3270	B
right	3270	B
yep	3270	B
right	3270	B
yep	3270	B
yeah definitely i think that there's probably a lot of	3270	B
waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place	3270	B
i mean there was	3270	B
um people at Stanford who	3270	B
were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to um	3270	B
for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was	3270	B
and i think that that may be more widespread	3270	B
than well than we'd like to think but but then	3270	B
you know it's something that's hard to enforce too i'm sure	3270	B
um-hum	3270	B
right	3270	B
um-hum	3270	B
well that's right the i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste but i'm not sure that that's really that much of the	3270	B
problem i mean when you look at	3270	B
something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows	3270	B
how much you know at a million dollars a pop for Patriot missiles	3270	B
and	3270	B
yeah	3270	B
right	3270	B
um-hum	3270	B
um-hum	3270	B
right	3270	B
okay all right you too bye-bye	3270	B
we have one	3296	B
yes yes ma'am	3296	B
what-	3296	B
do you wish you	3296	B
i don't use it as much as my children and my husband do my actually my husband and i are taking a class at our local junior college	3296	B
called Microcomputers- Microcomputers 101 and we're just	3296	B
touching on database spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of you know different kinds of storage and we're just kind of touching on	3296	B
a basic computers	3296	B
we have an IBM compatible it's Gateway brand	3296	B
that we bought mainly for our children to	3296	B
have educational programs	3296	B
yeah what kind of a computer do you use at work	3296	B
uh-huh	3296	B
uh-huh	3296	B
right i worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four years	3296	B
it which was different	3296	B
but i missed	3296	B
right right how long are we supposed to talk on this	3296	B
oh okay okay this is	3296	B
this is my very first time yes	3296	B
oh okay	3296	B
uh oh	3296	B
oh okay oh okay that i have that too	3296	B
i	3296	B
where- where do you work	3296	B
oh you do oh well of course of course that's why you why you're making these calls right	3296	B
oh i see well this is a pretty good deal	3296	B
uh-huh	3296	B
uh-huh oh you do know Lotus huh oh that's great that's something we want to learn	3296	B
oh	3296	B
i've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it	3296	B
that's great	3296	B
uh-huh	3296	B
i have a question on this this thing that i'm this survey or whatever you know this i volunteered for	3296	B
do i start calling in myself or do i wait for people to call me	3296	B
right an eight hundred number	3296	B
oh only one a day	3296	B
right	3296	B
oh	3296	B
oh i see okay so then do you get the five bucks or do i	3296	B
oh we both do well that's a heck of a deal	3296	B
right i had to put that in well that's a pretty good deal so why why are we doing this	3296	B
actually i'm doing this for somebody else but you know for a fund-raiser	3296	B
uh-huh	3296	B
oh	3296	B
it's almost like that	3296	B
like a voice command computer type thing oh	3296	B
well that's wonderful	3296	B
i see different kinds of voices and	3296	B
wonderful see that's why i it's interesting because you have i i'm going to say you have an accent	3296	B
and i and i think that i don't i mean to you but you know	3296	B
and you're in what city	3296	B
okay my sister one of my sisters lives in Plano	3296	B
is that right outside of	3296	B
how about_1 that i probably went through Richardson then	3296	B
and then i have a sister that lives in Austin	3296	B
but there both	3296	B
well we're actually all from Nebraska they just are recently moved there my brother-in-law is director of admissions at the University of Texas in Dallas	3296	B
yeah and then my sister works at the air force base	3296	B
actually yes they both have personal computers	3296	B
uh i think they just send Christmas letters on it as far as i mostly my one sister uses hers for	3296	B
her children you know children's games	3296	B
now we're ready do you have a personal computer	3296	A
you do in your home	3296	A
i do not have one in my home i use one all day at work but i don't have one at home	3296	A
do you find you use it a lot	3296	A
um-hum	3296	A
um-hum um-hum what kind do you have	3296	A
um-hum	3296	A
um-hum well that sounds interesting	3296	A
i	3296	A
i have a a PS 1 IBM type	3296	A
uh and i use it all day at work and i put all my personal stuff on it at work	3296	A
so i really don't haven't had a need for one at home but probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work i'd want one at home	3296	A
um-hum	3296	A
yeah what is that tracing tracking the flights and things	3296	A
uh-huh	3296	A
they tell us when we're through	3296	A
they come in and tell us have you just started doing this	3296	A
oh really they'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that	3296	A
it's not more than five minutes- but i'm going to ignore that that's a call on my other line so i'm just gonna ignore it but	3296	A
it's kind of a hassle when you have this but other times	3296	A
it	3296	A
i work at Texas Instruments	3296	A
yes	3296	A
i sure do	3296	A
well no i'm doing this at home i'm already home for the day	3296	A
i do it uh you know i can't do it at work i i'm i work in the legal department so i'm pretty busy	3296	A
but i use my PC there mostly for creating legal documents we use WordPerfect Lotus	3296	A
um	3296	A
yeah it's really i love Lotus i think that's about my favorite	3296	A
um-hum	3296	A
it really is and i know there's still a hundred things i don't know how to do on it	3296	A
but uh you know you learn something every time you use it	3296	A
um-hum	3296	A
you can did they give you a number to call	3296	A
you can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you but you can only make one call a day	3296	A
yeah if you've talked to someone like you're talking to me now and i place the call this counts as your call	3296	A
so you cannot make a call now until tomorrow	3296	A
no we both do	3296	A
didn't they ask you for your ID number when you answered okay so you both do from what i understand	3296	A
it's for research	3296	A
it's a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know to uh it's uh well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up	3296	A
um-hum um-hum they're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this now i don't know	3296	A
i don't know everything about it but they uh try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this and that way they can check voice patterns	3296	A
um-hum and get the computer where it recognizes voices	3296	A
well i probably do since i've	3296	A
well i've been born- i was born and raised in Texas have lived here forever so i probably do	3296	A
i'm in Richardson it's right outside of Dallas	3296	A
uh-huh well Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano	3296	A
you probably did	3296	A
um-hum well what are you doing way in Washington	3296	A
um-hum well that's interesting	3296	A
uh-huh so i imagine they use personal computers	3296	A
do they do their correspondence on it	3296	A
uh-huh	3296	A
um-hum	3296	A
so the question- the question had something to do with usage of personal computers um	3221	B
um i'm a firm believer in in having lots of them i'm sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
good grief what do you do with all those	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
right	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
that's what you do on your at least one of your machines on your Commodore	3221	B
yeah	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
yes	3221	B
yes yes	3221	B
well i um i do an awful lot of	3221	B
preparation of documents um uh and i- i use	3221	B
word processors and and fancier programs i mean you know graphics programs and simply make all of our slides um some of them i do on a Sun some i do on an XT	3221	B
um now maybe we don't call these personal computers um	3221	B
i started out with you know an IBM PC back in the	3221	B
you know about a year after they came out	3221	B
and you know	3221	B
i- i work for the government in Washington	3221	B
of in in in an obscure part of the defense department	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
uh-huh	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
are are are you are you also a professor or or do you just research	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
yes	3221	B
i can believe what are you gonna what are you gonna do when you stop i mean take all your machines with you or	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
yes	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
yes	3221	B
yes	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
yeah	3221	B
yeah	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
um-hum	3221	B
yes we are we are talking about computers this morning	3221	A
and at home i have a Commodore	3221	A
and a Zenith and my wife has an AT&T 1200 i believe it is	3221	A
well actually on my Commodore i mainly study lottery numbers would you believe i have written some uh programs in basic	3221	A
whereby i can select any number of uh drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most	3221	A
i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical uh appearance of these numbers	3221	A
to see if there's anything that's consistent on that	3221	A
i have another number that allows me another program that allows me to	3221	A
add all the numbers i want and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered	3221	A
so this is what i do most of the time uh	3221	A
on my Commodore on my Commodore um-hum and of course i have uh	3221	A
word processors and i write all my letters is is wonderful uh my uh thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time and i get them_1 all down and	3221	A
so how about you Charles	3221	A
um-hum	3221	A
uh-huh	3221	A
yeah	3221	A
so where- where may i ask where you work sir	3221	A
i know you work for the government i just wondering are you a NAVC or what	3221	A
what what section of it roughly	3221	A
oh uh-huh because_1 see that's my type of work too i work at the Applied Research Lab here here on campus and	3221	A
my my field is underwater acoustics and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into uh studying	3221	A
how	3221	A
uh things vary in the water you know and uh taking advantage of them_1 and so forth so it's a very nice very nice field and i- i am retiring at the end of this month end of December excuse me	3221	A
yes	3221	A
i'm a professor- i'm an associate professor but my i my i'm a full time researcher	3221	A
and it's uh been a very very interesting career believe me	3221	A
well-	3221	A
well uh	3221	A
the ones here in the laboratory obviously i'm they're gonna stay but i have similar machines at home i would consider uh uh doing some more consulting when i get home	3221	A
but i have a very very busy extra life anyway i'm also a musician and i play in several symphony orchestras and uh i run a concert band and	3221	A
so i have a lot of external uh interests	3221	A
but i do want to get very deeply much more deeply into computer work because obviously the world is gonna be controlled run and operated by computers in the future there's no doubt about it because it is really taking over	3221	A
and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because uh it's so much involved	3221	A
and it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that than i am because uh i don't get to use it in my daily work as much as i would like to	3221	A
here again let's say i'm starting to getting ready in preparation for retirement and uh so basically what i'm doing is	3221	A
slowly getting rid of my things for many many years i had a full size acoustics uh	3221	A
study laboratory where where i could take recordings and and uh perform experiments with them_1 and so forth and so that's gone now and so i'm sort of out of business	3221	A
uh as i say i worked with NAVC fellow named Steve Blazey was the fellow i worked with for many many years and he is now retired	3221	A
so it's been an interesting life and computers have come in towards the	3221	A
latter end of that i wish we'd had computers in the very beginning it would have been	3221	A
uh so what have you seen recently	3285	A
okay i've seen uh oh Necessary Roughness	3285	A
that was filmed in Denton	3285	A
uh have you seen that one	3285	A
it's pretty good	3285	A
i really enjoyed that one	3285	A
um	3285	A
let's see	3285	A
i just rented um we watched um	3285	A
let's see	3285	A
yes wasn't that a good movie	3285	A
i really liked that one	3285	A
but i like um	3285	A
oh who's the lead in that Swayze	3285	A
i think he's a good actor	3285	A
yeah Patrick Swayze	3285	A
and	3285	A
oh you do	3285	A
oh really	3285	A
oh really um would- that would be wonderful	3285	A
uh	3285	A
and uh he that one he has out recently that Point Break	3285	A
i haven't seen it but they said it's really good	3285	A
i haven't seen it	3285	A
we rented um	3285	A
oh what was that movie	3285	A
about the rock star and i can't remember what it was now	3285	A
um	3285	A
boy and i can't remember now um	3285	A
i can't remember what that one is um but uh	3285	A
The Doors	3285	A
oh yeah that's the one he's in now and that's suppose to be great	3285	A
and then um but i've also rented The Doors with um that story about the Morrison	3285	A
and uh	3285	A
that is weird i mean i- i couldn't understand it i guess it was real tough to understand	3285	A
i do too i do too	3285	A
um	3285	A
they're unreal i mean it's it's almost too much and	3285	A
yeah and it's like no we're not provoking it no	3285	A
and and it's even what what kills me even more is what we've allowed to go over the television	3285	A
you know movies are one thing where there is some type of rating	3285	A
but TV is out of control as far as i'm concerned	3285	A
yeah	3285	A
you know i- pretty soon we're going to use every word in the English language on the television and everything else but	3285	A
yeah that's the truth	3285	A
um one of the movies i'm i just moved here from South Dakota	3285	A
and uh Dances with Wolves was filmed out by where i	3285	A
yeah and that's where we lived yeah in Pierre and uh	3285	A
yeah	3285	A
but um my father-in-law flies and he flew us over the like the buffalo ranch and everything where they you know took them heat there is a herd of buffalo	3285	A
that they used for that and um	3285	A
that was quite a long movie but it was good	3285	A
it really was	3285	A
um-hum	3285	A
yeah the the hardest part with that is that it was very you know good from a historical part of it but to you know for now there was a lot of um discrimination feelings coming back out	3285	A
you know living up there with you know the tribes and things like that it started to come back it started to surface again	3285	A
which was kind of a	3285	A
uh-huh	3285	A
yeah they were going to rename that to	3285	A
oh now i can't remember	3285	A
Custer yep and now they're going to rename it Little Big Horn	3285	A
yeah	3285	A
yeah that whole thing kind of	3285	A
did that	3285	A
and then of course i always watch Julia Roberts' movies	3285	A
i always watch the Julia Roberts' movies	3285	A
yeah like Pretty Woman and	3285	A
i think Flatliners i really enjoyed	3285	A
see and i	3285	A
that was really good that was that was weird	3285	A
you know for to to see if you know the person's description of that	3285	A
yeah they were	3285	A
right they were like five medical students	3285	A
and he they would put them into death for thirty seconds or whatever and they'd come back out and see how close they could get	3285	A
and when they'd come back out they'd bring their sins with them and they had to	3285	A
and they had to settle their sins because_1 they brought them back with them it was really weird	3285	A
but it was	3285	A
well let's see	3285	B
uh-huh	3285	B
uh-huh	3285	B
no	3285	B
uh-huh	3285	B
uh let's see i guess one of the last ones i saw that i really enjoyed was Ghost	3285	B
that was great	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
Swayze yeah	3285	B
yeah we have a	3285	B
personal acquaintance with	3285	B
his mother	3285	B
she's a dance instructor over here	3285	B
not an instructor so much she choreographed a	3285	B
some of his movies	3285	B
Patrick Swayze yeah	3285	B
yeah i haven't seen it	3285	B
huh	3285	B
<b_aside> hey Gayle <e_aside>	3285	B
<b_aside> what was one of Patrick Swayze's last movies <e_aside>	3285	B
getting a little help here	3285	B
Point Break	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
um-hum	3285	B
i didn't see that or hear any of that	3285	B
well i let's see i just uh	3285	B
feel obliged to make a comment that the uh i think the movies have too much violence in them these days	3285	B
and they wonder oh gee i wonder where all this crime is coming from	3285	B
huh-uh	3285	B
um-hum	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
yep	3285	B
it seems that way	3285	B
um-hum	3285	B
oh really	3285	B
that's one of the just the one i was just fixing to say was Dances with Wolves	3285	B
yeah you liked that i suppose that would be one i would expect you would like yeah	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
yeah it was that was uh	3285	B
interesting from the	3285	B
historical standpoint	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
yeah you heard about them_1 going to rename or uh talking about renaming the	3285	B
the that park up there where the uh Little Big Horn was fought	3285	B
it was Custer's	3285	B
and now	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
that's a good idea	3285	B
pardon	3285	B
Julia Roberts	3285	B
hum	3285	B
um-hum	3285	B
i don't think i see- i see did i no my wife was watching that i saw little glimpses of it	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
yeah	3285	B
oh that was where they uh	3285	B
these	3285	B
like researchers were	3285	B
trying to see if they could put them_1 to death and then bring them_1 back	3285	B
yeah right	3285	B
um-hum	3285	B
oh i never did see that part i just saw the first part	3285	B
oh i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap	3254	B
uh we have four but most of them_1 are gone now so there there might be but we were taking you know uh four five and six people out	3254	B
yes	3254	B
i'm in Texas	3254	B
and we lived- we lived in Ohio prior to this oh	3254	B
uh we were up near Cleveland yeah	3254	B
but i look for service even at the quickie places type things uh i don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong and then you're stuck and it's a pain to have to	3254	B
stand there and see what it is before you leave so i really don't like the drive-thrus that much i- i like to go and eat there	3254	B
but i would say service uh atmosphere and whether the food is good on on going out i like steaks so we try to hit those places when we can	3254	B
um-hum	3254	B
yeah	3254	B
uh yeah and in in in the countries unless it's a large city i guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main that's what you find right	3254	B
my husband likes um Dairy Queens he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs i guess so he's a fan of of Dairy Queen and and we'll go even in town here at times just as a a change although	3254	B
i'm not that excited about it it we've eaten- we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like to really eat any place but yet i hate to cook food at home	3254	B
so that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five	3254	B
nights a week maybe or we eat junk food at home	3254	B
uh now that my husband	3254	B
oh we'll go to them_1 all we sort of take turns and and we uh i'm sort of favor the ones if i have a coupon we can go there and if not we can't	3254	B
because it's cheaper so mine is monetarily i guess strongly monetarily	3254	B
based uh we'll go get pizza and uh at Little Caesar's although the kids prefer Domino's	3254	B
right	3254	B
but it's just a lot cheaper than than Domino's so that's	3254	B
we go to Grandy's quite a bit i would say	3254	B
so i don't uh we don't go	3254	B
there that much	3254	B
a nice meal oh	3254	B
it's usually when we're out of town and i'll order steak or steak and lobster combined	3254	B
so that it's really not in town	3254	B
no	3254	B
um-hum	3254	B
um-hum	3254	B
right	3254	B
don't well we don't go out that much i guess- well i guess we do go out without kids we're usually picking things up quickly though and just we just don't	3254	B
dwell on food too much and uh with my husband traveling he can get all he needs for that during the week going to those places so it it doesn't really matter to him he'd probably just like to stay home	3254	B
right	3254	B
well i think our i i never have liked to cook food but i think it all began eating out when we had uh the boys in in different uh	3254	B
baseball on baseball team- it was mainly baseball teams and my husband would coach	3254	B
so that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when i started to sub make money i went oh well i'll just sub to	3254	B
-okay where do you enjoy dining out	3254	A
yes do you have children	3254	A
ah	3254	A
yes that makes a difference doesn't it uh-huh what area of the country do you live in	3254	A
yes i am too	3254	A
so	3254	A
i did too i'm from the Dayton area	3254	A
ah	3254	A
uh-huh	3254	A
that's right	3254	A
yes	3254	A
when we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals and then that way they can get their burgers and fries and we can have a salad bar	3254	A
so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens but	3254	A
right that's right	3254	A
i know	3254	A
uh-huh	3254	A
uh-huh	3254	A
oh	3254	A
uh-huh	3254	A
um	3254	A
yeah	3254	A
so what are some of your your favorite inexpensive places	3254	A
uh-huh	3254	A
oh we are Little Caesar fans here that's where we always go	3254	A
yes we like Grandy's too	3254	A
oh	3254	A
where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out or a big meal	3254	A
where you go for steaks	3254	A
ah	3254	A
uh-huh	3254	A
ah you ever been to Houston's on Beltline	3254	A
that's where we go to get steaks they have a teriyaki steak there and when we have something to celebrate we head to Houston's they don't take reservations and you wind up waiting about an hour	3254	A
but the food is good and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five o'clock then you can go right through	3254	A
but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks so	3254	A
that's our nice place to go we don't usually take the kids when we go there	3254	A
yes	3254	A
right	3254	A
that's right	3254	A
yeah that's the way with my husband he's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends and i've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere	3254	A
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekends	3254	A
right	3254	A
yes	3254	A
uh-huh	3254	A
right	3254	A
yep	3254	A
i'm already on my job so you're you reached me at my job	3219	B
my my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual	3219	B
uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt	3219	B
the um thing that that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar	3219	B
and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing but when i don't need to dress up for a a meeting or a service of some sort i don't	3219	B
yes	3219	B
well around there you can probably wear uh T-shirts and other things but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and uh coats	3219	B
today today we we wear coats and as the day uh warms up we may go to light jackets but i don't think there's an escape from light jackets	3219	B
the wind will take away a lot of body heat	3219	B
very similar	3219	B
no i'm not stuck with that kind of a uh situation	3219	B
as i say unless it happens to be now yesterday i had to dress up and and um be more formal because i had a a formal meeting at noon time	3219	B
but then i can go home later in the day and and be a little more casual	3219	B
and then if i have a a a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening	3219	B
yeah that's around here in a lot of places that's the way it is i mean there there are expected- expected uh dress codes	3219	B
and the people need to follow that i think uh years ago i used to be far more uh committed to the idea of of a dress code but i've	3219	B
relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself	3219	B
it's taken a long time to break away from from that but now that i've broken away from it i'm i'm glad i have	3219	B
you mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses anymore	3219	B
that's a good idea that's a good idea	3219	B
no they're you -know what-	3219	B
but yeah what kind what kind of shoes do they wear down there	3219	B
um-hum	3219	B
we we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in in almost every every situation	3219	B
unless you wanna look like a gook	3219	B
a lot different	3219	B
you too and thank you for calling um-hum bye	3219	B
okay why don't you start so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon	3219	A
oh you are	3219	A
oh wonderful well how do you dress for work	3219	A
um-hum	3219	A
uh-huh	3219	A
um-hum	3219	A
so you in a church there	3219	A
uh-huh well i'm working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds	3219	A
and they have a lot of uh they they have Bible lessons and they have all the things during the morning but they still have snack time and play time so i'm gonna be dressing just in casual slacks and T-shirts	3219	A
probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just just tennis shoes and play clothes	3219	A
yeah	3219	A
i'm envious well it's a beautiful day here and it's in the sixties but we still have a lot of hot afternoons it's supposed to be eighty five today	3219	A
so you'll still see people it's kind of an in between change they're they're in their play clothes i mean they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons	3219	A
because_1 you just can't stand the sweaters but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly	3219	A
do you	3219	A
i understand	3219	A
well so are the people around you um uh dressing similar to you	3219	A
um-hum so you don't have a you don't have to go out and buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do	3219	A
well that's good	3219	A
that's good	3219	A
um-hum	3219	A
well that's wonderful	3219	A
well my husband has to take the bus into Dallas and doesn't return all day so he has to dress	3219	A
and he's just really hates that they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit	3219	A
and even when his job is not gonna be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress	3219	A
um-hum	3219	A
um-hum	3219	A
um-hum	3219	A
well i think that's i think that's great i think that's good	3219	A
i understand	3219	A
well another interesting thing on the our our end here is how even- even in my forties how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties	3219	A
and i will uh run around to the store and things in slacks and tennis shoes and she	3219	A
well there's not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing	3219	A
so i- i guess this is what you call a natural end	3219	A
well we wear uh course um like i said if if my husband's going downtown he's got the whole uh	3219	A
you know the dress men's dress shoes	3219	A
but for as out here just anything that the moms we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids	3219	A
yeah i'm sure they are there yeah i'm sure they are	3219	A
thank you very much bye-bye	3219	A
okay well uh some of the books i've read lately have to do with crafty type things where i've	3233	A
where i've um learned things that i'm going to do for my children for Christmas	3233	A
and they were really uh helpful	3233	A
because i didn't know how to do this one stitching	3233	A
and so that was very helpful to me as far as books otherwise	3233	A
um i like to read children's books	3233	A
and things like that what about you	3233	A
oh	3233	A
hm	3233	A
uh-huh	3233	A
oh	3233	A
uh-huh it's interesting that you said that my husband and i had uh took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden	3233	A
um with-	3233	A
oh yeah and our our uh cantaloupes and and um peppers and tomatoes are on right now	3233	A
so it's been really fun and and we learned that you know um some of the gardening skills we had were before but some of them we learned from a book	3233	A
and so that was helpful to us now i've read two books	3233	A
uh that were uh nonfiction lately and uh	3233	A
i	3233	A
well one was nonfiction and one was fiction	3233	A
and the fiction one uh was about a boy in uh during the time of Adolf Hitler	3233	A
and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp	3233	A
and that was not enjoyment that that was too realistic and really um mind	3233	A
a real eye opener uh and i guess it's good to read those things too	3233	A
uh but i didn't enjoy it necessarily	3233	A
and uh the other one was quite enjoyable it was uh about a	3233	A
a Chinese lady and her generations down her what happened to her family through the years	3233	A
so that one was good i think all of uh well even if they're not enjoyable they bring you uh a some kind of of learning	3233	A
so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that	3233	A
so i	3233	A
i- i like to read the the children's books i think that's the most animated and imaginative so i like those a lot	3233	A
oh there are a couple of Newbery Award winners uh A Wrinkle in Time is one and i don't know if you've ever read that but but um	3233	A
oh there's one about an Indian girl and i can't think of that	3233	A
Island of the Blue Dolphins is another	3233	A
and that's a good one	3233	A
now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year i haven't read and i would like to read those	3233	A
but uh it's funny because_1 i've read some from like nineteen twenty three and nineteen forty five and things like that	3233	A
and i didn't enjoy those as much and i don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what but uh	3233	A
yeah	3233	A
uh-huh	3233	A
uh-huh	3233	A
uh-huh no even that's good	3233	A
um-hum	3233	A
yeah uh my children and i uh i started a thing where i read a book with them before they went	3233	A
to bed at night and there was one called The Pig Princess	3233	A
and it was a a princess from a long long time ago and she came through a a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig um sty and the people that she came to were just	3233	A
farm people and she didn't understand them and they didn't understand her but it came together in this book and it was really a lot of fun	3233	A
um-hum	3233	B
oh goodness well i was an English major so i like to read period	3233	B
uh lately i've been on the whole very practical	3233	B
and uh i'm trying uh to to uh furnish a home	3233	B
so i've been	3233	B
looking at i'm not sure reading is the word but looking at books on uh antiques and paintings and uh interior decoration hints	3233	B
and uh lots of books on plants and and and gardens because we started a garden	3233	B
and things things like that and so i've been doing very little reading except i- i did finally dip into a couple of biographies	3233	B
um all of sort of literary figures of this century	3233	B
oh	3233	B
good for you i haven't gotten around to that	3233	B
uh-huh	3233	B
yes	3233	B
hm	3233	B
hm	3233	B
no	3233	B
um-hum	3233	B
oh	3233	B
uh what are your favorite children's books	3233	B
um-hum	3233	B
no	3233	B
hm	3233	B
um-hum	3233	B
um-hum	3233	B
that's interesting i- i- i well i mean you can't be an English major- major unless you like reading things from the past	3233	B
so i've read a a great deal of old things i tend to go go back i don't have any children	3233	B
so i don't read the new ones but i occasionally if no one's looking	3233	B
dip into something like Winnie the Pooh or	3233	B
or uh uh the the Grimm's Fairy Tales or something like that	3233	B
um just because it's sheer magic	3233	B
uh-huh	3233	B
hm	3233	B
yes	3233	B
yes i think that uh we we	3233	B
uh-huh	3230	B
uh-huh	3230	B
uh-huh	3230	B
yeah	3230	B
i'm pretty much the same way but there's like certain types of country western i can't handle that twangy stuff	3230	B
yeah my in-laws listen to the kind of music i hate	3230	B
the old real old yeah but other than that i like pretty much everything and uh	3230	B
uh-huh	3230	B
um-hum	3230	B
um-hum um-hum	3230	B
do you like Kenny G	3230	B
uh-huh	3230	B
oh no	3230	B
uh-huh uh	3230	B
yeah the heavy metal	3230	B
so hm	3230	B
well same here y'all have a good day bye-bye	3230	B
-okay basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for uh uh real hard hard rock i really can't get into that but	3230	A
i go from classical all the way to uh jazz and country and	3230	A
uh soft pop um so i pretty much have a a wide range of um what i like you know just	3230	A
there isn't any particular music that i enjoy more than just listening to all kinds so-	3230	A
so that's about it i can even take the reggae now it's it's pretty neat music that they came out with so	3230	A
uh-huh sure uh-huh sure the the old old stuff that came out i think it was was it oh jeez	3230	A
came out with some of that Hank Williams you talk about twangy yeah yeah	3230	A
yeah	3230	A
oh yeah the old old country	3230	A
yeah	3230	A
yeah yeah that's the way i am too so	3230	A
other than uh as far as instruments so- i can go from piano to the saxophone and lately you know with the new music that has come out some of the really good uh music	3230	A
they have the saxophone playing and it's so funny because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself <b_aside> oops are you okay Tina come here honey <e_aside> oh my daughter just fell come here	3230	A
uh yeah a little bit i can i can pretty much oh it's all wet Tina i just wiped uh did the floor and she slipped so	3230	A
anyway but uh um yeah i can take all kinds of music pretty much except for when you get like i said into the real hard rock	3230	A
hearing anyway	3230	A
uh-huh sure uh-huh exactly	3230	A
okay well it was good talking to you then	3230	A
oh okay you too bye now	3230	A
hi i'm wondering what what camping means to you	3253	A
oh very good that's sort of the same thing that that i do i don't think of um trailers and campers and all this stuff	3253	A
um do you do much camping	3253	A
oh you've never been camping oh gee	3253	A
well um yes and no and the uh i haven't done much recently but um up until	3253	A
gee maybe five or six years ago i did a lot of it and you know i've sorry	3253	A
no um i used to live abroad and so i- i camped a lot in um the Middle East and i was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting	3253	A
and a bit exotic for those who love bugs but	3253	A
um and then when i used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up um to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and and do camping there	3253	A
and you're not going	3253	A
oh that's too bad	3253	A
oh gee	3253	A
i guess it makes a difference i grew up camping being in Girl Scouts and things like that so	3253	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3253	A
oh that's too bad i think the you know there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like but maybe not the you you know the Canada men's trip but some other you know a nice tent on the the shore of a lake and	3253	A
right the and the the no telephone the gee whiz you go to bed when it gets dark and you get up when it gets light	3253	A
yeah and um i guess just just the change from the rat race	3253	A
no it's uh it's pretty isolated um and to me i like that i guess too although there are people i mean you know it's really hard to get away	3253	A
and i guess when when we did sites in in the Middle East of course it was with a group in order to make it safe	3253	A
but i mean we'd go in different parts of the ruins and and things like that but we didn't even have tents there we just sort of put out the sleeping roll	3253	A
right	3253	A
right actually i just joined um the Appalachian Trail Walking Club or whatever they call it what uh and i'm very eager to to start uh i love to walk	3253	A
and um i'm going to start with day trips though because i don't know the territory and all and i'm not sure um my son is not eager to go and you know i think that that that might be a little eerie at first going alone	3253	A
oh but you know i'm gonna try well gee whiz i hope you get into camping some day just slowly	3253	A
oh yeah	3253	A
right i think that you know i guess one time recently we went up to Maine and had planned to camp	3253	A
and you know the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field and i said gee whiz for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a a motel which we did and so that you know if the setting was right and that it's it's great but if it's just-	3253	A
hi	3253	B
when i think of camping i think of of bugs and sleeping bags and and tents uh like along the Appalachian Trail	3253	B
no	3253	B
i have never been camping	3253	B
no do you do much	3253	B
really uh	3253	B
where you live now or uh did you camp up in Maryland or	3253	B
oh okay	3253	B
oh i bet	3253	B
uh-huh	3253	B
oh okay well my cousin- uh husband and and his uncle especially uh grew up camping together and uh they they just love it	3253	B
and they're planning a trip uh into Canada	3253	B
this i guess in about a year and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there	3253	B
no this is this is a a man's trip so	3253	B
so they're really looking forward to that	3253	B
so	3253	B
and see i was i was never exposed to it	3253	B
so it's i- i feel like i'm a little bit too uh much of a city city mouse to try doing it	3253	B
what's the best part about it to to you the the quiet the getting away	3253	B
man	3253	B
now do you usually like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around or is it pretty much- much isolated	3253	B
yeah	3253	B
yes	3253	B
oh good grief	3253	B
that that does sound neat but i don't think i i've got a quite enough nerve to do that	3253	B
i know my husband's gone uh for several days on the Appalachian Trail before and he said that you can a lot of times you can go for you know a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail	3253	B
so it's not for the faint of heart i don't think	3253	B
oh	3253	B
uh-huh	3253	B
i think it would be yeah well that sounds really neat	3253	B
well	3253	B
i don't know uh we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague	3253	B
and uh i- maybe like you said start out slow and and kind of get used to it and find out that it maybe it's not as bad as i- i fear it might be	3253	B
yeah	3253	B
well we don't do so much now but when uh i- i was uh a child we went regular old camping tents and and everything like that and then with our children we did uh we had a pop-up tent camper	3293	B
and we used that to go camping	3293	B
we uh years ago we lived in Oklahoma and we went to uh Lake Ardmore i mean Lake Murray all the time but when we did it with our children we lived in uh Tennessee and we went up into the Smokeys	3293	B
which was just absolutely fantastic	3293	B
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and along the uh	3293	B
there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee through uh Georgia and into Alabama and uh i think it was called the	3293	B
uh White Cloud or White Mountain and went up on it	3293	B
it got real cold but the uh camper had uh	3293	B
beds in it you know when we had that one and uh so we just you know we had our bedding we didn't have to go with sleeping bags but the when i was a	3293	B
uh teenager and growing up that was sleeping bags and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or you know ground and uh that got kind of rough sometimes	3293	B
oh do you	3293	B
oh uh-huh	3293	B
oh uh-huh	3293	B
oh	3293	B
oh just beautiful	3293	B
yes yes i understand that	3293	B
but	3293	B
yeah my husband and i he he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt and i- i agree with him our children are are grown but i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the TV	3293	B
oh i know i know oh they just you know they just thoroughly enjoy it you know or enjoyed it	3293	B
um-hum	3293	B
yes yes	3293	B
yes like i know that you know breakfast we would you know we'd have these big breakfast cooked over this little Coleman stove and	3293	B
yes and would just absolutely taste wonderful	3293	B
there would be oh maybe twenty twenty five of us because_1 it would be all of my mother's family you know and all my cousins and it	3293	B
oh no no we were in the we were in the woods you know	3293	B
well we didn't notice it back then but that was back before air-conditioning was so prevalent- you know prevalent and all	3293	B
and uh you know and it it always rained on us i don't care what weekend we went and when it was it always rained on us	3293	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3293	B
cuddle up um-hum well i don't know i remember one time uh some cousins were in a tent and it was married cousins and they they had the tent and this you know frog strangler that we used to call him came through and	3293	B
they were had put their tent over kind of i don't know what it wasn't a creek bed it was like kind of like a little	3293	B
yes yes it does it really does um	3293	B
yes yeah even i would kind of like to go and i know if i go home and say oh let's go camping my husband says you're crazy i enjoyed talking to you too thank you bye-bye	3293	B
okay well uh what what do you all do for camping	3293	A
uh-huh	3293	A
um-hum	3293	A
where do you go	3293	A
oh uh-huh	3293	A
oh	3293	A
oh i bet it was around Gatlinburg or somewhere out in there	3293	A
ooh	3293	A
um-hum	3293	A
well now did you all sleep in sleeping bags and did it get real cold at night or	3293	A
oh yeah	3293	A
uh-huh	3293	A
uh-huh	3293	A
well we only did that once now since we've been married we just go um we go real often to Colorado to the mountains but we'll stay in cabins	3293	A
and you know we call it going camping but we're really not but the one time that i did go camping when i was about i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family we drove	3293	A
to uh up by Cosa- Cosa Springs Colorado and went about_1 seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest ranger if you tried and to the the tent for a week	3293	A
and at night it was so cold you thought you'd never feel your feet again and the smell and the stars were just five feet above you you know they were just right there and it was the most	3293	A
well that's true um-hum	3293	A
uh-huh	3293	A
well that that's and they can't believe that they could survive it and then once they're there they they think it's kind of cool	3293	A
oh yeah with bacon oh yeah	3293	A
and and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast so we usually had a bite apiece one one	3293	A
oh my goodness	3293	A
well now is that hot camping is that where you're you're hot like on a beach i mean is that	3293	A
because_1 a lot of our friends will	3293	A
well a lot of our friends in east Texas- will go to east Texas in the summer and camp and i'm thinking how could you stand it you know just-	3293	A
yeah	3293	A
yeah yeah that's true we did a lot	3293	A
but i like that and see especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain and you'd get your book and just kind of cuddle up and i thought that was fun	3293	A
uh-huh	3293	A
golly	3293	A
well	3293	A
yeah well i yeah i understand that too because_1 some of the places we in fact the the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit it loses it's flavor	3293	A
so well i've i've gotten in the mood to go now yeah	3293	A
i you're crazy well listen i enjoyed talking with you	3293	A
okay have a good day bye-bye	3293	A
well uh and that's an idea that's been around for kicked around for a long time i don't know that it's ever been	3284	A
seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that but uh	3284	A
i believe Israel does that don't they for their	3284	A
people in the	3284	A
well- everybody has to do has to do something or maybe maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone but uh	3284	A
okay	3284	A
no i don't think it's it's necessary- no- i think of that it it it couldn't be military service is not that much but	3284	A
military used to do it but the idea that uh	3284	A
there are things that that do need to be done that could be done and then uh country would benefit from one year from from everybody and even out the	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
requirement	3284	A
well now that's a thought yeah	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
um-hum	3284	A
yeah right	3284	A
oh yeah i'm afraid you're right there but uh	3284	A
but uh	3284	A
anything like this it came up whether it it	3284	A
quickly would be	3284	A
significant industry in in figuring out how to get around it where	3284	A
people who didn't wanna	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
um-hum	3284	A
um-hum	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
uh i suspect that the yeah that that that that's not the thing that they- that they don't feel it's open to them it's just that they	3284	A
uh are more self-centered if you will and not not considering voluntary preference	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
um-hum	3284	A
um-hum	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
at uh	3284	A
now i didn't-	3284	A
i don't know it did-	3284	A
i i think you're right that that that's not the not the way that the society these days is going and i i	3284	A
think we need to we need to try to figure out some way to to turn that around that everybody	3284	A
hm	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
yeah	3284	A
or -that could be	3284	A
yeah right	3284	A
yeah i agree- i	3284	A
agree with that and uh	3284	A
and i'd i'd	3284	A
i don't know what what- what has what has set it off or what but it- it it certainly seems to me that that uh	3284	A
uh	3284	A
things in in the last twenty thirty years uh things- things have- have definitely gone towards uh	3284	A
very much the concentration on self and- and and loss of loss of perspective in terms	3284	A
uh yes i think so uh	3284	B
yeah i don't know-	3284	B
yeah i believe that's right	3284	B
and uh and i don't know that that's really what we're talking about uh	3284	B
yeah for for kids in high school it could be in the summertime	3284	B
uh	3284	B
you know um	3284	B
it it could even be done while they're doing another job while they're doing you know a job to make money	3284	B
but uh it's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it it i think the family would have to be involved in it and and people would have to be convinced that	3284	B
you know i i think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving	3284	B
and that's not the kind of society we have right now	3284	B
yeah there are lots and lots of volunteer programs and um	3284	B
but most of those are	3284	B
at least- at least it it's my opinion that most of those involve uh adults	3284	B
adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire	3284	B
to to give	3284	B
it's not uh	3284	B
you know it's not uh maybe the- maybe it could- uh younger people feel like it's not open to them i don't know	3284	B
but- but it should be if it's not	3284	B
yeah it is kind of an introspective time of life but some schools- some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to	3284	B
uh	3284	B
you know areas economically uh	3284	B
say less advantaged areas and uh	3284	B
they they promote service	3284	B
on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people	3284	B
so at least that's a step in the right direction i guess	3284	B
yeah it's really it's really unfortunate because when you do	3284	B
i do volunteer work for the American Lung Association	3284	B
and i have have done uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society	3284	B
and there's there's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved	3284	B
uh it's it's really a gift to yourself and and that's i think that's a really- a really important lesson to learn	3284	B
and- and and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy	3284	B
you know	3284	B
uh really is better to give then to receive	3284	B
the other other subjects um as i was sitting there i thought the weather's been perfect i don't know much to say about it it's uh	3215	A
and it's kind of cold in the mornings so you dress up warm but by and that's the only thing wrong i can find with it but	3215	A
oh how fun	3215	A
i miss that yeah	3215	A
yeah	3215	A
yeah	3215	A
ooh	3215	A
i guess you have to take some things and leave some things	3215	A
so yeah i'm from Utah area and the you know we have tons of canyons where the leaves change and they're gorgeous you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area	3215	A
hm wow	3215	A
huh	3215	A
we'll have to see how it goes a couple weeks ago we were cooler than normal but then we were back to being warmer than normal this week or last week so	3215	A
i don't have to live through many any of those really a bad i mean nothing comparable i guess to what you've had before	3215	A
you're right	3215	A
well they get ice and no one can drive on ice i mean we used to think they were pansies but then when you decided what ice was	3215	A
so well i think we've discussed it good enough today so it was it was good talking to you maybe we'll get to next time thanks Karen bye bye	3215	A
no	3215	B
i'm from Plano also	3215	B
that's right	3215	B
right	3215	B
i just got back from Dayton i spent the weekend in Ohio with my family and the trees are changing color there so that as soon as we got out of the cloud cover of course it wasn't sunny like it is here it was real gray	3215	B
but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees it just really made me	3215	B
realize how much i miss the fall i don't complain {weatherwise} though because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon	3215	B
so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies	3215	B
that's right	3215	B
yes	3215	B
we did that when we lived up in Michigan we went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure	3215	B
and then on leaf weekends it was- which is this time of the year it's bumper to bumper traffic people it's whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road	3215	B
yes	3215	B
i think it is and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on- at the TV news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule	3215	B
as far as the coldness of the temperatures and uh the first frost everything just happened three weeks early this year	3215	B
just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring i	3215	B
well i've only been here just a short time too so i haven't been through any of those either so i have in Michigan but in in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on	3215	B
so as i understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and and close businesses	3215	B
right	3215	B
right the real definition of ice	3215	B
i think so it was nice talking with you okay okay bye	3215	B
well let's see we're supposed to talk about movies	3278	B
i don't uh i'm trying to think i have not gone out to a movie we rent a few but i haven't rented- rented one real lately so you name a few that you've seen see if i've seen them	3278	B
i've not seen it i've not seen it but i've heard a little bit about it	3278	B
oh is that right	3278	B
well i i was just reading about it though and it's uh it's been a sleeper hit it's already grossed like forty million dollars	3278	B
so it's it's actually becoming a pretty good hit across the United States	3278	B
so they are liking it	3278	B
and uh	3278	B
it's just i think just a silly entertaining movie- movie from what the articles i've read about it which you know you go just to be entertained and and people are liking it for that	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
uh-huh yeah	3278	B
did you	3278	B
right	3278	B
oh oh you went out and watched them_1 film	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
um-hum	3278	B
i bet that's true a lot of wide open spaces out there	3278	B
i've never been up that direction i'd like to	3278	B
the main thing i think about is that it gets so cold in the winter up there	3278	B
wow	3278	B
and and will occasionally up until Thanksgiving probably	3278	B
well we'll we'll have some cold days you know like uh in in uh October and September you know we had some pretty cold nights but uh	3278	B
but uh up until Thanksgiving really uh well we usually get our first frost middle of November	3278	B
somewhere	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
do you have the time-	3278	B
three hours that's the only complaint i've heard about that it's so long	3278	B
uh-huh passes fast huh	3278	B
it's	3278	B
oh i like him everything i've seen him in i've liked real well	3278	B
yeah uh Field of Dreams yeah that was good i saw that	3278	B
no i haven't	3278	B
i bet it is- is uh i've not even i don't think i've even read i usually read the uh critics in uh Time and People and i pretty well agree with their thinking on most movies	3278	B
and uh but i've i've don't believe i've read one about Robin Hood yet it's already it's yeah it's released isn't it	3278	B
yeah maybe that's why they'll get to it shortly	3278	B
but uh is it on uh video yet	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
i need to get that Dances With Wolves i would sort of like it at first i thought uh i don't know you know	3278	B
i'm tired of having these Indians everybody pushed down our throats how we've mistreated them so and all that	3278	B
i'm sick of all that	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
right	3278	B
uh pushing a little too far yeah yeah that's	3278	B
that's the very reason i have not even rented it from the video i- i and everyone that uh i've talked to has said yes you'll love it you'll love it and i'm sure i will	3278	B
but uh and i'm sure i'll see it before too long	3278	B
i bet it is	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
that's true	3278	B
that's true you know uh just because our ancestors did certain things they did it i think as a matter of survival and not to be	3278	B
brutish to other- to some other people you know	3278	B
yeah	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
uh-huh	3278	B
yes	3278	B
i like Julia	3278	B
i like her i uh i'm trying to think what my favorite with her was uh oh what is it where-	3278	B
yes uh have you seen any recently or	3278	A
um we just went out to one about couple weeks ago it was Necessary Roughness the one that was filmed in Denton	3278	A
yeah it it was pretty good but i- i don't know if if you saw this and you weren't in Dallas or around Texas if you'd understand some of it	3278	A
yes i don't know if it'd be good if you were outside of Texas but	3278	A
oh really	3278	A
well that's good it- it- yeah that's good um let's see	3278	A
yeah that's what it is	3278	A
uh-huh	3278	A
yeah and and that's good um that's pretty much what it was about it was just uh you know a a comedy you know just a a football team that was bad and come up you know	3278	A
and uh we just moved here from South Dakota and uh Dances With Wolves was filmed up there when we were there um-hum and we saw that where they filmed- they filmed it in Pierre South Dakota and that's where we went to see it	3278	A
um yeah they the buffalo and all that on the ranch um my father-in-law owns a plane and he um took us to the buffalo ranch and where they you know use the buffalo to film and	3278	A
and uh took us out there and you never knew that there was so much land that was not developed you know until you go you know and see that yes but um	3278	A
yeah it's nice	3278	A
is that when it starts changing	3278	A
uh-huh	3278	A
uh-huh	3278	A
okay yeah they've had two already two freezes	3278	A
so	3278	A
and so and that was a really good movie and it lasted three hours	3278	A
yeah	3278	A
it's- it's really long but i don't know- it didn't feel like it was that long but after you got out and thought oh wow it was longer but um Kevin Costner was really good in that	3278	A
oh i think he's great	3278	A
um-hum he's you know done uh i can't remember now but the baseball show um	3278	A
yes Field of Dreams and have you seen Robin Hood with him in it or	3278	A
i haven't either and i've heard that's just great	3278	A
um-hum	3278	A
um-hum	3278	A
um-hum	3278	A
um-hum yeah it's probably been out for you know like a month now yeah	3278	A
yeah	3278	A
um no huh-uh i don't think it's out on video yet i still think it's at the theaters	3278	A
but um	3278	A
uh-huh well	3278	A
oh and see that's how we've you know we come out of it going yeah we come out of it going you know it's it's hard you know for us you know it was a good movie it interpreted what happened then but	3278	A
it brought out a lot that isn't going on now that they again felt that they were you know being so mistreated and and and- yes and it was not what we mean now you know	3278	A
uh-huh	3278	A
um-hum	3278	A
because_1 that's quite a deal you know being up in there in South Dakota where we have to pay the government funds to them and keep the tribes going and and you know it it hurts me because	3278	A
you know i have to keep paying this but yet i don't feel that i did anything to them but you know we have to keep doing this and you know	3278	A
right	3278	A
and how they lived	3278	A
right and and how they lived is very different from what we try to do now and and i feel that	3278	A
we're not working with territory or things like that now that we're overpowering somebody's territory or something like that now but	3278	A
but um you know i've i've seen a lot of Julia Roberts movies	3278	A
i do too	3278	A
wondering how you keep up on the news	3267	A
um-hum	3267	A
i guess the i get the Washington Post and that is pretty big newspaper and i think that's	3267	A
almost exclusive my -exclusively my first of the news though i have the radio on when i go to work i don't think the news	3267	A
usually hits because_1 i'm not going right on the hour	3267	A
yeah	3267	A
right	3267	A
um-hum	3267	A
right i think that you know we've we've resolved the issue and that's what we were asked to do	3267	A
right	3267	A
right	3267	A
oh okay well thanks for discussing it bye-bye	3267	A
primarily with our local newspaper and TV	3267	B
i listen to the radio but not um	3267	B
not like i did when i was working i am recently retired to that means i have a lot of time to watch the news on TV how do you gain your news	3267	B
oh i see well that's that is one of the handicaps with both TV and	3267	B
and radio if you're not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper	3267	B
that is the Washington Post is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it it's a splendid newspaper	3267	B
so what more do we need to discuss tonight that seems like a very short one	3267	B
well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but um i feel that that's not part of our responsibility	3267	B
so thank you for calling	3267	B
all right good night	3267	B
i think the last one that we actually went to go see	3228	B
well there's two i took my kids to see 101 Dalmatians of course they wanted to see it they had the Disney book and they thought that was wonderful and they loved the dogs and	3228	B
so yes we went with some friends of ours and i was a little worried about my son he's about two and a half and	3228	B
he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them_1 and can't see them_1	3228	B
and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message you know that the the the puppies are missing and it shows the town and you can hear all the barking but you can't see the dogs yeah	3228	B
yeah so that kind of bothered him but after that he did fine	3228	B
yeah he'll be three in January	3228	B
yeah	3228	B
i loved that movie	3228	B
probably gives them ideas of what they wanna do right	3228	B
yeah	3228	B
wasn't that good	3228	B
oh no	3228	B
well i like to watch the movies but it's gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video and we rent them_1	3228	B
and now we did go see Home Alone at the dollar movie and that was just hilarious i died	3228	B
and we we did also we went to see What About Bob one night which is a funny funny movie with uh	3228	B
it's a funny movie	3228	B
that's true	3228	B
i hope he stays cute not spoiled you know you get to where	3228	B
the money goes to their heads or goes to something you know they grow up too fast so	3228	B
but uh there's a lot i wanna see you know what i try to do when they come out is just make a list of them_1 that look good so that when they come out on video you know i'd like to see Green Card i want to see Awakenings uh i'd like to see Silence of the Lambs	3228	B
yeah	3228	B
and see i've had somebody tell me that Regarding Henry you know the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good i'd like to see that	3228	B
i've heard that's good yeah so i think there's a bunch of good movies coming out my kids wanna see Rescuers Down Under	3228	B
so i'm going to have- my VCR went on the blitz about two weeks ago so i'm getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies their little you know Disney movies they watch all the time and stuff and	3228	B
yeah	3228	B
do you know	3228	B
i look at those like Cinderella came out was for sale and i don't buy them_1 i now i will copy them_1 and rent them_1 and keep them at home but i just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that i can go down and rent for a dollar	3228	B
you know and they don't last that long	3228	B
oh that's pretty decent	3228	B
yeah yeah	3228	B
that that makes it worth it uh but	3228	B
a lot of the Disney movies it's just too expensive and i can rent them_1 or i can make a copy you know my daughter's in love with the Little Mermaid and i have a copy that's just about worn out she's four	3228	B
so she just thinks the great- in fact she told me Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her Aerial now i'm not pregnant mind you but this is she's planning ahead for me yeah so	3228	B
yes	3228	B
oh i saw	3228	B
now see i remember thinking it's a wonderful movie but it's been so long since i watched it i don't remember the language it was bad well that's true	3228	B
oh and see my kids weren't in the room- you're right i watched it without them	3228	B
huh	3228	B
huh	3228	B
yes	3228	B
yes	3228	B
yes some of it just isn't a	3228	B
okay well what movie have you seen	3228	A
uh-huh	3228	A
uh-huh	3228	A
it's one of my favorite even	3228	A
uh-huh	3228	A
yeah yeah	3228	A
yeah	3228	A
oh yeah	3228	A
a whole lot uh-huh kind of dark uh-huh	3228	A
is it well how is he young	3228	A
yeah okay that makes sense	3228	A
well my kids' very favorite and yours may be too young for it was Home Alone	3228	A
they uh well we do too but they just wanna rent that one that is their very favorite	3228	A
that black and white one and i was not real impressed with it in fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what what did that mean wait wait run that back and we couldn't run it back	3228	A
um-hum but we we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end and we thought we were being very quiet this man turned around and said could you all please save that for later and i'm sorry so we're just not real big movie goers	3228	A
yeah	3228	A
well that's us too that's us too	3228	A
yeah i thought that was cute too	3228	A
well my husband's name is Bob and he wants to see that	3228	A
yeah he wanted to see that i thought the funny part in Home Alone was uh that's good for kids is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking	3228	A
and i thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that the little guy's so cute and he's terribly rich by now	3228	A
yeah me too	3228	A
oh that's right	3228	A
that's right	3228	A
that's right	3228	A
uh-huh Awakening is supposed to be wonderful	3228	A
yeah Awakening is supposed to be wonderful my mom saw that and she said that was an excellent movie	3228	A
yes yes	3228	A
i think that's supposed to be good and i uh we have some doctors at church who said that Doctor was just wonderful um-hum	3228	A
uh-huh	3228	A
oh dear	3228	A
uh-huh	3228	A
well on uh back to your movie you saw that ten thousand uh 101 Dalmatians um uh did you all ever think about purchasing that one when it comes out	3228	A
um-hum	3228	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3228	A
well i understand that too i understand that too now they had	3228	A
um-hum they had Home Alone offered for like i think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars and i thought well now that's that's close enough to being several you know you could rent it more than once- more than four times and watch that	3228	A
well i understand- i understand i understand	3228	A
oh yeah of course	3228	A
uh-huh	3228	A
yeah	3228	A
oh sweet but that's in her plans well it's hard it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids	3228	A
and even the ones that we rent at home the trouble with some of them i know we rented Adventures in Babysitting thinking that that would be so cute and it's a precious movie but the language in it is just for no reason	3228	A
has to stick in	3228	A
uh-huh	3228	A
well you watch it differently when your kids are in the room you know	3228	A
and i was just sitting there going oh my goodness and i'm going to have to stop and explain and they go i know Mommy i know	3228	A
uh-huh yeah it's it's real different because you see things from a different different angle	3228	A
uh we rented this summer before we went on vacation we rented Chevy Chase and that Family Vacation	3228	A
and those are just absolutely hilarious but you just really can't watch a lot of that we had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it	3228	A
okay i've got a you know i have a real good method of	3279	A
starting to get the budget balanced again and that's get half of the government rid of the half the government payroll	3279	A
not all i you know i don't know if you've ever been to Washington DC	3279	A
uh you you've seen that which was on there and the offices and in light of these uh hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed	3279	A
they really don't have enough to keep them_1 busy and keep their noses at in their own business and what they're doing and the other thing is uh	3279	A
besides that i think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid	3279	A
i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us i find that a total waste and part of the defense budget	3279	A
uh again being just a voter- voter and a taxpayer	3279	A
you know working through our congressman i don't think there's too much that i'm gonna be able to do about it but	3279	A
i believe in taking an active part in politics so	3279	A
um-hum	3279	A
right	3279	A
um-hum	3279	A
yeah they don't they don't seem to well	3279	A
i really think the biggest problem and then the Taft Rudman Act is supposed to help that the biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing	3279	A
i mean this nonsense that's coming through now about uh uh lowering	3279	A
payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to- to boost the economy because people have no- more money is it's it it's ridiculous	3279	A
no	3279	A
yeah and thank God we don't operate our budget the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in in dire trouble	3279	A
but that's uh	3279	A
yeah i don't know what we're gonna be able to do about it but i guess it's been around so long that	3279	A
isn't that's the way they're thinking these days anyway	3279	A
i i don't think it ever will really i maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest	3279	A
you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense	3279	A
really if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic	3279	A
you know intergovernmental- intergovernmental or inter-United States type programs that i wouldn't really mind i	3279	A
i believe in paying my share and i don't mind uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to but i just i just	3279	A
sometimes feel like i'm being used but uh again i don't think we'll be able to do anything about it so	3279	A
yeah bite the bullet it sounds like you have a baby there	3279	A
yeah	3279	A
oh really	3279	A
oh that's a shame she's not the one going to Washington huh	3279	A
oh	3279	A
okay okay Jerry	3279	A
we've probably been on long enough they didn't cut us off but i think that'll probably do it so it was nice talking to you	3279	A
okeydoke bye-bye	3279	A
i think that would probably uh be very possible and and and we really wouldn't feel it in our services	3279	B
yes i have	3279	B
right	3279	B
right	3279	B
right	3279	B
yeah	3279	B
well i one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes and the um	3279	B
regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of of our personal income and then the uh corporate	3279	B
yeah industries just- don't- seem to not pay proportionally	3279	B
i think that that would would help a lot i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things but	3279	B
i don't know it's just hard to hard to take um you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use	3279	B
and uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction	3279	B
but	3279	B
yeah	3279	B
yeah	3279	B
not not gonna help	3279	B
we're- we're being serious	3279	B
oh	3279	B
it seems seems to be i you know i it really does bother me when i think about you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh	3279	B
a national problem that we can't seem to find an an answer to it i i don't know	3279	B
right	3279	B
yeah	3279	B
well that that's quite possible i guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit or it'll just totally get even more out of control but i i don't know	3279	B
yeah i i do she's a we're not feeling too well over here so that yeah	3279	B
no no she's i don't think i could part with her	3279	B
okay	3279	B
okay well thanks bye bye	3279	B
oh okay	3290	B
uh-huh	3290	B
she can	3290	B
well i- i work um i'm a CPA and i do contract work	3290	B
and so and i work with another CPA who just started his own practice and i work with him a couple days a week and so when i go to his office or to other clients' offices then i'll dress up	3290	B
but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever so that that makes it pretty nice it	3290	B
it's kind of weird because_1 before i used to work you know full time and and uh it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day just about	3290	B
it's it's very nice i	3290	B
uh-huh	3290	B
sure	3290	B
uh-huh	3290	B
uh-huh	3290	B
right	3290	B
yeah yeah well i imagine that where you live uh you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year	3290	B
not really	3290	B
oh is that right	3290	B
um-hum	3290	B
uh-huh so y'all are waiting for that	3290	B
uh-huh	3290	B
yeah	3290	B
right	3290	B
right	3290	B
yeah	3290	B
well down here it's sunny most of the time and uh	3290	B
usually warm i mean we've had a few cool days uh this month but not anything i'm sure compared to what you've had so far so i mean people are still wearing shorts and	3290	B
and uh usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler so you start you know breaking out a coat	3290	B
at that time but that that lasts you know for a few months	3290	B
no	3290	B
no never wore slacks it was	3290	B
i think it was one of those things where it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them_1 it was one of those understood things that you just you know either wore you know a dress or	3290	B
not no not not with what i did um most people didn't sometimes like the secretaries might	3290	B
but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much and i really you know there's some nice pantsuits out and and i wouldn't have minded- minded you know wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold	3290	B
but um	3290	B
uh-huh	3290	B
you know i think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional i guess they expect women to be in skirts or dresses	3290	B
yeah that's right and it's the men that make the rules	3290	B
but no we usually you know skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is- is what you see down here so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants	3290	B
no one no one can see me unless i'm you know gonna-	3290	B
yeah i think that- the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing	3290	B
right	3290	B
yeah	3290	B
uh the- the only work i do outside the home is i am an Avon representative	3290	A
and i sell Stanley products	3290	A
and uh	3290	A
so i- i don't really i don't really dress up a whole lot do you work outside	3290	A
oh uh-huh	3290	A
oh	3290	A
uh-huh	3290	A
um-hum	3290	A
um-hum	3290	A
um-hum um-hum	3290	A
um-hum	3290	A
well you'd have to dress	3290	A
differently when you're working every day i think yeah	3290	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh it's kind of a nice to relax a little bit yeah	3290	A
yeah well my my dress up i live out in the country also so what i wear depends on the weather	3290	A
uh so i really i know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up but i mostly dress	3290	A
i try to dress nice but for convenience because when the weather's bad when i go into the home i take off my shoes	3290	A
which i try to wear something easy to take off you know and put on and i don't too often take off my coat even so	3290	A
uh i really don't have to dress up like you you would like if you're in an office or something	3290	A
uh well not actually because we really only have maybe three four months of i'd say warm weather	3290	A
yeah and the rest is uh gets into the cooler weather	3290	A
um-hum but even for now we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and uh cold weather and that type of thing now my daughter works all the time so she dresses	3290	A
it- i think you know you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have the appearance a good appearance to do a good job	3290	A
where you work	3290	A
um-hum	3290	A
um um-hum	3290	A
um-hum	3290	A
um-hum um-hum	3290	A
right yeah	3290	A
did you find you wore uh slacks when you were working full time or did you did- did they wear more dresses and skirts	3290	A
no slacks	3290	A
uh-huh	3290	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3290	A
uh-huh not even a dressy slack a dressy suit slack suit even if it's all	3290	A
uh-huh	3290	A
uh-huh	3290	A
um-hum	3290	A
um-hum um-hum	3290	A
hm	3290	A
um-hum um-hum i know my daughter mostly i don't think she ever wears slacks- slacks to work but i didn't know if- the trend changes you know if uh	3290	A
uh-huh	3290	A
uh-huh look more like a woman huh uh-huh uh-huh	3290	A
uh well then you you- you know why they make them_1 then that way	3290	A
um-hum um-hum	3290	A
yeah	3290	A
yeah but yet you need to keep up an appearance for your husband too though at home but that's i- i believe	3290	A
oh you don't think you will huh well you'll be excused because considering everything huh uh-huh	3290	A
uh by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress	3290	A
um-hum	3276	B
you should still be	3276	B
well they really are even for even when you're not talking about surgery if you're just talking about basic care we've	3276	B
yeah	3276	B
can still make big bucks	3276	B
do you think that the quality um it would would be as high	3276	B
yeah	3276	B
yeah	3276	B
right more motivation	3276	B
yeah	3276	B
right yeah	3276	B
that's true yeah i uh	3276	B
well we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured and and you know you cannot i mean it's just	3276	B
oh sure	3276	B
right	3276	B
um-hum	3276	B
oh yeah	3276	B
that's right	3276	B
yeah	3276	B
right	3276	B
see	3276	B
yeah	3276	B
okay as far as uh universal health care um	3276	A
i guess i'm all for it i think it's time that we start looking at um	3276	A
getting into that um health cost has continued to rise and i think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh life- life of a person um	3276	A
it- it doesn't matter if you have money or no money- or all the money in the world um you would	3276	A
everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits	3276	A
um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and	3276	A
uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal	3276	A
yes	3276	A
um-hum	3276	A
oh sure	3276	A
and your constantly exactly	3276	A
yeah the only i- i know that um uh i know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care and there's some	3276	A
pros and cons one of the things of course is everybody gets health care but uh sometimes health care	3276	A
uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh	3276	A
how can i say it um over like in Poland uh where my father-in-law lived for years their their health care system is	3276	A
um because no financial gains are available for doctors	3276	A
uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the US do it for financial gain	3276	A
they say well jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i don't have to do this i can do this and i can you know	3276	A
yeah or plastic surgery or uh if i become a uh heart specialist i'm gonna make this kind of money uh and there's	3276	A
you know financial gains toward that and in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors	3276	A
the quality i think goes down um-hum when you have a universal system um	3276	A
the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of because i think uh all physicians well anybody um	3276	A
likes the ability- ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated uh i guess that's the whole US concept is to come here and	3276	A
yeah and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system maybe you know there's a way of working that out but	3276	A
i know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it that's what they look at it as there's no	3276	A
uh and that's sad because if that's the case if- if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway but	3276	A
that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind	3276	A
so	3276	A
but i- i think we have to head toward that way	3276	A
uh-huh	3276	A
i'm worried when i get older you know and uh let's say for instance you uh	3276	A
get fired or or not fired but maybe laid off from your job you no longer have insurance	3276	A
i mean and you're sixty some or uh fifty some years old you try try to find insurance	3276	A
i mean you're- you're uninsurable unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month and i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance	3276	A
and how they can do it i have no idea um i know working for small corporations and health insurance um myself	3276	A
um it would cost for a family and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up and this was working for like a {medcenter} uh health plan	3276	A
um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck so	3276	A
see yeah	3276	A
well we do the same i mean it's i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know it's getting harder and harder to survive	3276	A
and uh and that's why uh if they don't go to a universal system something's going to happen we're gonna have uh	3276	A
uh larger amount of people dying	3276	A
okay so you said that you live in Coppell	3237	A
so what is your house like	3237	A
oh well that's neat	3237	A
uh-huh is it one that you're renting or buying oh	3237	A
yeah yeah well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex you can still buy that's good do you have any children	3237	A
yes i have two children and our home is really too small for us right now	3237	A
yeah we moved from an apartment that was really small and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old	3237	A
and we moved into this house in Garland it's in one of the older areas of town and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere and	3237	A
you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty but the the house is real small it has less than a thousand square feet	3237	A
yeah it's real little	3237	A
yeah and now i have a daughter now my the one that was five months old is seven years old and the one and i have another one that's three and a half and i have all these clothes and toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put	3237	A
well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a a built on addition room you know but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet	3237	A
so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and you know it's kind of a catchall room	3237	A
but it sure is nice to have it	3237	A
when the kids come over to play they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff so	3237	A
yeah that works out good and i'm thankful i have two girls because they're in bunk beds and so you know they can share a room and uh make for more space that way	3237	A
she's three and a half yeah	3237	A
so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet we made a higher and a lower and it works out fine but they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag you know and	3237	A
uh we're going to have to figure out a new idea but we're we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home and uh hoping to be able to do that within a year or so so that would be nice	3237	A
yeah is Coppell a nice area to live	3237	A
well i think i've heard a lot uh about Coppell schools that they're real good and that's neat do you do you hope to have children or are you not planning on having any or ah i see well do you have any pets	3237	A
uh yeah ah so do they stay inside or ah well that's neat	3237	A
yeah well what are the colors in your house	3237	A
oh i bet that's pretty	3237	A
uh-huh	3237	A
oh well that's neat i like cows too	3237	A
yeah well our house was redone- uh our house is very old also it's like thirty seven years old yeah and it was redone before we moved in which i'm	3237	A
thankful for that but the it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in you know everything is like	3237	A
the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has um	3237	A
paneling in the living room and lots of lots of tans and lots of browns but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that you know so	3237	A
uh that's worked out good in the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan um wallpaper and had done it up with blues so that's nice that's	3237	A
yeah yeah we've enjoyed living here it's it's close to my uh oldest daughter's school and that makes it really handy too	3237	A
and she really likes her school so and we're so close to shopping and just	3237	A
yeah what uh how about in Coppell i've always imagined it kind of out away from everything	3237	A
oh really	3237	A
oh well that's nice	3237	A
oh wow	3237	A
oh	3237	A
yeah yeah but it does sound like it's definitely growing	3237	A
yeah	3237	A
oh uh-huh	3237	A
uh-huh	3237	A
oh i see well when we first moved here we moved here from Lubbock and we almost moved to Lewisville that was our second choice yeah behind Garland we at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home	3237	A
um-hum	3237	B
it's a two bedroom two bath duplex brick	3237	B
and uh	3237	B
no we own it yeah well our side uh-huh uh-huh	3237	B
uh-huh yeah	3237	B
no huh-uh do you	3237	B
um-hum	3237	B
ours is too we outgrew it when we moved in	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
um-hum	3237	B
um	3237	B

uh-huh	3237	B
how fun	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
and how old's the youngest	3237	B
um-hum	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
um-hum	3237	B
um-hum	3237	B
yeah	3237	B
yeah	3237	B
that's what we'd like to do	3237	B
oh it's wonderful place to live and they i don't have any kids so i don't really know but they say that we have wonderful schools	3237	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum um	3237	B
nah- i don't think so nah oh of course those are my kids i have two dogs	3237	B
yeah they're inside dogs they're my babies	3237	B
uh um kind of a mauve and gray	3237	B
um-hum and then the kitchen's kind of a a country pink and country blue and	3237	B
it's all done in cows i'm a cow nut	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
so	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
wow	3237	B
yeah yeah	3237	B
um-hum	3237	B
um-hum	3237	B
oh yeah yeah	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
oh sounds pretty	3237	B
oh	3237	B
um-hum um-hum	3237	B
well good	3237	B
that's an important factor there	3237	B
well you know now we have that new mall in Lewisville and that's just like a mile or two from our house	3237	B
but when we first moved to Coppell it's what six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store	3237	B
and now we have four and Coppell's not really big enough to support four- four grocery stores	3237	B
so	3237	B
oh much very much in fact it's about the size now i moved down here from Chicago what twenty three years ago and to Lewisville	3237	B
and Coppell's now about_1 the size that Lewisville was when- when i moved down here	3237	B
uh-huh	3237	B
oh really	3237	B
okay and uh i i missed a part of it we're to talk about what lawns and gardens	3251	B
uh-huh	3251	B
uh-huh	3251	B
i well it's it's it's very strange- strange that i got this call because my wife just called me i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn	3251	B
and you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall fall bulbs	3251	B
uh	3251	B
right that's the way this was the the petunias were really great our mums are are beautiful	3251	B
uh i don't know if we i don't think we've had a frost up here i've been i was down New Orleans for a week so i don't know what happened last week	3251	B
uh but uh it seems like it's	3251	B
oh i don't know if it's late i'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer so i can get a lot of stuff down out here	3251	B
um i i enjoy it we came here we just moved into this well we moved in November and put all all the landscaping in this this year we came from nine years in a condo	3251	B
uh and working in that condo you didn't have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to so	3251	B
right you know i've had this is my	3251	B
third third house i think i've owned	3251	B
um but uh it's interesting the only the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it so but uh i i enjoy	3251	B
most of it and about this time of year there is it starts getting a little old and i start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my	3251	B
ah well it is it is for me because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing we had a terrible summer we had a drought	3251	B
and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing and now it's really growing and i'm trying to establish a good root root growth know for the winter	3251	B
really	3251	B
uh	3251	B
oh really um yeah	3251	B
oh yeah yeah i hear that from my brother-in-law lives in Plano	3251	B
yeah	3251	B
well he always	3251	B
he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here and then he calls us yeah it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine so	3251	B
oh i yeah	3251	B
uh-huh	3251	B
yeah that is i was you know i was like conditioned to it they're they're have to be hardened to it already yeah that's uh that's strange with me	3251	B
you know you think	3251	B
Dallas you know almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of that kind of problem but	3251	B
um-hum	3251	B
really oh do they	3251	B
uh-huh	3251	B
i love	3251	B
yeah i love the uh the landscaping like i say my brother-in-law lives in Plano and i get to Carrollton quite a bit	3251	B
i go there on on business and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens and	3251	B
Texas is Dallas- Dallas is very nice i really enjoy it there the landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing it uh very enjoyable gardens and my wife and i	3251	B
well	3251	B
yeah that we have you know Ohio's a a very pretty state we moved in seventy six we moved to Chicago we lived there for five years	3251	B
and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt uh we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said she said Randy there's no trees down there	3251	B
i said there are this is Illinois you know and when we got out to the area where we decided- decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land	3251	B
and now all of a sudden it was being developed and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees	3251	B
lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do i'm i'm a putterer i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard	3251	A
oh	3251	A
um-hum we've had a late fall it seems like the weather in fact today it's really warm and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up but you know you need to pretty soon	3251	A
oh	3251	A
uh-huh	3251	A
uh-huh	3251	A
um-hum	3251	A
so now you have the chance to really create and and spread out	3251	A
um-hum	3251	A
the grass not growing so fast	3251	A
oh	3251	A
hm ours seems to have slowed down here we're not having to mow every week religiously	3251	A
but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year	3251	A
uh-huh	3251	A
but like today it's eighty five degrees it's really strange	3251	A
but that'll change real quick then we'll wished we'd planted bulbs and pansies already	3251	A
oh my gosh	3251	A
well Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot	3251	A
and we have ice storms every year and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings	3251	A
um-hum	3251	A
well for the most part we don't but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold well the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter	3251	A
but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to	3251	A
and uh pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing	3251	A
uh-huh	3251	A
um-hum	3251	A
except for the lack of trees out where we are it was all cotton fields and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it	3251	A
um-hum	3251	A
hm	3251	A
um-hum	3251	A
uh i don't know i've got mixed feelings about the topic	3242	B
no okay	3242	B
well	3242	B
well i don't believe in drugs or alcohol but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the TCAT	3242	B
they were talking about drug testing us	3242	B
and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine	3242	B
and we found it belittling	3242	B
yeah	3242	B
that's true	3242	B
but then you know at the same token i'm not against because i look at airline pilots	3242	B
bus drivers	3242	B
you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs	3242	B
and alcohol	3242	B
and	3242	B
you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our	3242	B
you know house	3242	B
yeah i think it's just like anything else a new concept you know as i had said if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted	3242	B
but at the same token in education we can't do drug- drug random drug testing on kids	3242	B
you know i mean their rights are protected	3242	B
what well but why if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids	3242	B
when we see them and they're you know under the influence	3242	B
that's true	3242	B
it's three minutes and the clicker comes in when it's time to	3242	B
yeah no	3242	B
yeah- well do we agree or unless it's it's not me you know here we go again i mean	3242	B
yeah you know i believe that truck drivers and people that have even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk	3242	B
and there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk	3242	B
uh-huh	3242	B
and yet	3242	B
uh well no it you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else	3242	B
and uh	3242	B
yeah well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation	3242	B
it was on the news tonight	3242	B
yeah	3242	B
then i think you know if it came push came to shove i'd probably be drug tested	3242	B
you know because_1 it does you know	3242	B
yeah because_1 you know as i say i'm sitting there fussing and fussing and yet i know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic	3242	B
in school as well as you know i presume out	3242	B
um-hum and you know my children brought it to my attention i never was there to see it	3242	B
um-hum	3242	B
and that's not giving a good example to students	3242	B
well how did you like that topic	3242	A
do you i don't	3242	A
no i'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know	3242	A
i agree with it i think uh i think a company should be able to test at any any employee anytime they see fit	3242	A
i just i just don't think there's a place in our environment- environment you know in the work	3242	A
force for drugs or alcohol either	3242	A
right	3242	A
uh-huh	3242	A
uh-huh	3242	A
you did uh-huh	3242	A
well i can sort of understand that uh but not being a teacher as you are you know i- i was not quite as sympathetic as you know as i probably would have been if if Kay were a teacher or something	3242	A
but uh	3242	A
uh-huh	3242	A
uh-huh	3242	A
that's right that's right	3242	A
that's- that's right and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know but uh	3242	A
yeah i think so too i- i agree with it uh i know Kay's company you know they started it couple of years ago	3242	A
and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know and i thought jeez to me it's quite simple uh	3242	A
you either need a job or you don't the the job is what provides all of your needs	3242	A
and uh if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey i agree i don't i won't do that and i think most of them_1 have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first	3242	A
yeah it- it it is i can see where you would think yeah that is belittling you know i'd probably feel the same way	3242	A
if i had to do that	3242	A
yeah that's true	3242	A
you bet oh gosh they would- they would really raise a stink if that was to happen	3242	A
right yes i agree with that i i i wouldn't be opposed to it at all it's just our bleeding heart liberals that would	3242	A
fight it tooth- tooth and nail you know	3242	A
but uh well Lynn i've enjoyed talking with you i don't know how long we're supposed- to carry on a conversation do you	3242	A
oh well we'd better keep talking because_1 i've not heard it have we have you heard it	3242	A
anyway we both a sort of agree on it don't we	3242	A
about- about random testing	3242	A
well you see i yeah yeah if you agree	3242	A
yeah	3242	A
is that right	3242	A
you just don't think of that happening with teachers	3242	A
i really don't i when i think of drug testing i'm thinking of the	3242	A
uh you know- outside of education	3242	A
sure sure i know that but uh you don't think of that first hand normally	3242	A
isn't that	3242	A
isn't that mind boggling goodness it it is it's mind boggling- and well you know i agree with you i know	3242	A
teachers are	3242	A
just like everybody else same problems the same uh good qualities as anybody else	3242	A
yeah yeah	3242	A
you- you think the benefit would be greater than the	3242	A
uh-huh	3242	A
and that was in your children's high school isn't that amazing	3242	A
if it if it's if it was true there i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is	3242	A
you know because they represent a pretty good	3242	A
uh	3242	A
no certainly not uh certainly not	3242	A
they don't need that example but	3242	A
okay i'll just go with you first what kind of eating out do you enjoy	3259	A
right	3259	A
um-hum	3259	A
um-hum	3259	A
do you go like home cooking like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria	3259	A
me too	3259	A
uh-huh	3259	A
Mexican uh-huh uh we do too we do the same what are your favorite places	3259	A
um-hum	3259	A
uh-huh	3259	A
oh yeah well we go we've gone to August Moon and we think that was real good but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon	3259	A
and those are excellent they're really a nice place you could take someone to eat it's not the the rinky-dink- Chinese decorations but it's a very elegant nice place to eat we go	3259	A
very very often we go out for fajitas that's my husband's just gotten stuck and we go to On the Border	3259	A
and lots of places that have uh i think Costa Rosa and some of those and get fajitas and he'll just eat chips till we've got three or four baskets coming back	3259	A
and then uh last weekend we went out for Italian also and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to wanna go eat lasagna and garlic bread so we went to El Sorrento	3259	A
and it was fun	3259	A
you know what this is that's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church and Bob pointed to it and he said i keep hearing good things about that place we're gonna have to go	3259	A
that's what he said- that in fact you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that	3259	A
so i guess we'll have to do it he	3259	A
that's what that's what it D Magazine said that it said there was always a line but that's probably i mean that's a good that's a good sign	3259	A
yes we did now my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti	3259	A
or lasagna and most of those things were a little more northern Italy	3259	A
and they like just the traditional they're not very	3259	A
yes they are exactly exactly the place of the seventies	3259	A
um-hum yeah most kids do what- do you ever go for steak just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing	3259	A
um-hum	3259	A
yeah	3259	A
well i'm i'm real curious to try this one that has such horrid commercials the uh that Del Lincoln and	3259	A
oh what is that guy's name they do those real corny commercials	3259	A
it's um over there's one over there in Addison	3259	A
i can't -remember his name anyhow it's some	3259	A
yeah it's some famous steak place over in Addison there's a there's a second one downtown	3259	A
and they have these really corny radio commercials but their steak- their steak is supposed to be wonderful so i had- i had not tried that my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie	3259	A
and it seems like i've been we- we found those one time and then they discontinued it was over in Addison and then they um closed up so most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here	3259	A
um-hum	3259	A
uh-huh	3259	A
well that's exactly true that's right	3259	A
that's right yeah that's right	3259	A
that's even- yeah that's right	3259	A
uh-huh	3259	A
i had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown for prime rib and i haven't been we usually don't go for beef really anymore we're we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna	3259	A
um-hum	3259	A
um-hum	3259	A
i know well i understand	3259	A
well now what your what's your child's favorite place to eat	3259	A
oh yeah they're easy yeah well	3259	A
mine enjoy that too they like to go pretty much where we like to go and they'll and then our favorite thing on Fridays we generally order pizza in so not Pizza Inn but pizza to our house	3259	A
so we've done that well um is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it i think we've i think it's come to a nice conclusion so i'll talk with you later thank you bye-bye	3259	A
okay well i like dining out of course it means that i don't have to cook but um i'm a divorced woman i have one child and you know when when we dine out	3259	B
we go to like medium priced restaurants i don't i don't particularly i think it's sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant	3259	B
um yeah- um	3259	B
not really we go more for the um Chinese and Italian and stuff like that Mexican stuff that i can't cook yeah	3259	B
um well i like Chinese food um uh there's a little place down on what is that Coit Road um	3259	B
Chinese Pavilion or something that is really good and i like it and um i do i do like Chinese buffets	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
right	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
oh	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
right uh-huh uh-huh have- yeah have you ever um tried Pappasito's	3259	B
oh it is delicious	3259	B
um-hum	3259	B
it's you always stand in line when you go but it's worth the wait	3259	B
um-hum	3259	B
uh-huh and have you ever tried um the Macaroni Grill up on	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
right	3259	B
that- they're they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type right yeah yeah my little girl likes uh Spaghetti Warehouse real well it's real entertaining for her	3259	B
um	3259	B
not really that's a steak something that i cook at home	3259	B
you know that that you grill out and i really don't particularly um	3259	B
hm	3259	B
steak	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
um-hum	3259	B
hm	3259	B
yes	3259	B
right i think that's what goes you know really goes right now in the in the Dallas area of course you know down	3259	B
next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know there's just a there's a different class	3259	B
of restaurants up there that i can't even touch	3259	B
you know it'd probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there but um	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
uh-huh	3259	B
right um-hum	3259	B
um-hum yeah when when i go out it's it's normally to get um some specialty type of food besides you know because you- chicken and steaks and everything i grill at home	3259	B
and and really it's they're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant that's right saves you a little bit money	3259	B
um	3259	B
favorite place uh she has a lot Taco Bell yeah that's right	3259	B
that's right	3259	B
um-hum	3259	B
right	3259	B
right uh-huh	3259	B
no not that i know of	3259	B
uh-huh thank you bye-bye	3259	B
do you have any children	3266	B
oh	3266	B
i work in a day care center	3266	B
yes i enjoy it a lot	3266	B
oh	3266	B
do they go to a day care center or do they stay at	3266	B
oh that's nice	3266	B
oh that's nice	3266	B
i- i think so i think it's hard to find a good day care i have worked in another- at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion but this one that i'm in now is	3266	B
is very good and one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children	3266	B
and- like in Pennsylvania for babies that's what i work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most	3266	B
no more than four babies per care giver but we keep it down to like two to one	3266	B
yeah that makes a little easier to deal with	3266	B
oh i know we	3266	B
what we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are um low to the ground and they're reinforced real strong and they'll sit four babies we would just lie them in there and they roll- roll real well and maneuver	3266	B
that get them_1 out	3266	B
no	3266	B
right right	3266	B
yeah that's certainly something we hope never happens	3266	B
most really care in this center really care uh most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education	3266	B
and really there's only like eight children per room and there's like two or three mostly- mostly three care givers in each room and that enables them to spend more time with the children	3266	B
sometimes that- i feel like all i'm doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap so it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them	3266	B
it's easy get attached to them too	3266	B
um in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months	3266	B
and throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve	3266	B
so i have the real real young ones in my room	3266	B
um-hum	3266	B
they're yeah they're wonderful they don't complain too much	3266	B
yes they are a lot of fun	3266	B
not quite it's a when- they start to crawl they try to climb up on things and	3266	B
you have to be real careful all the everything is baby proof you know all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything but they try	3266	B
in my area because we i live in a college town in Penn State University so i there's a lot of	3266	B
a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on and um	3266	B
in general though i've- i've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers i've worked at and-	3266	B
it all and all it's not my choice for when when i have children but some people don't have	3266	B
a choice	3266	B
yes	3266	B
um-hum	3266	B
that is sad	3266	B
what	3266	B
oh my God	3266	B
oh my God	3266	B
oh that poor child	3266	B
that's awful	3266	B
very good uh discussion or on child care	3266	A
uh they're all grown up	3266	A
oh well you know all about it then	3266	A
no uh my- my daughter that has three stays home with her children and one my daughters has one but an aunt keeps the baby	3266	A
but i would i would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays but i would imagine it's very hard	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
uh-huh	3266	A
oh well that's good	3266	A
i've always thought you know it would be really tough what if you had a fire or something with babies	3266	A
you would have to be able to have enough you know you'd have to be able to get them_1 all out	3266	A
uh-huh	3266	A
oh well that's that's a	3266	A
i hadn't thought about that but i was thinking oh my gosh if they had very many babies they couldn't possibly get them_1 all out	3266	A
but you could put them_1 in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess	3266	A
oh well that's neat	3266	A
well do most of your day care workers really care about the children or is it just a job for them_1	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
hm yeah how old a group how old are- the children go with this center- center where you work	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
you've got the little bitty ones those are the probably the best the best group to have	3266	A
and they're fun	3266	A
babies are fun and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet so	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
um-hum do you think there's very many really good day care centers around your area	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
um-hum	3266	A
sometimes it's a have to	3266	A
i hear a lot of the girls i work with uh constantly oh i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about you know	3266	A
most of them_1 don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids	3266	A
and it's really bad you know one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place and then they called her one afternoon and said well we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here	3266	A
Lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today and we just now found her	3266	A
they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon	3266	A
and so immediately she says well i can't have any confidence in them anymore if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them_1 and realize they're one short	3266	A
but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus and this was four hours later you know	3266	A
and- uh so you know what do you do	3266	A
so she has switched- switched to a different center now and uh	3266	A
doing good	3262	A
doing great i had a while to think about it so why don't i start and you can chip in when you feel like it	3262	A
uh when we were first married we didn't think we needed a budget and	3262	A
and i think it was fine with the two of us we just kind of spent as we wanted and seemed like we got paid off enough that it would cover	3262	A
oh it's been about_1 nine years so	3262	A
by the last week or two you were broke so that's probably when we started budgeting and ever since we just you know	3262	A
oh i don't know	3262	A
i probably plan what we're going to spend each month i mean we get paid and i deduct all that we're going to have-	3262	A
you know all the bills at first and then i set aside so much for utilities that we need and so much for this and	3262	A
then we have a certain amount each week to work with for groceries and	3262	A
and lots of times i go over that amount but	3262	A
um-hum	3262	A
uh-huh	3262	A
this is how much you spend on this you'd better not do it anymore	3262	A
right and that's usually about schooltime	3262	A
oh yeah	3262	A
yeah	3262	A
that's great	3262	A
um-hum	3262	A
right	3262	A
right	3262	A
yeah	3262	A
um-hum	3262	A
yeah	3262	A
yeah	3262	A
that's great	3262	A
i i break mine down quite a bit i keep what's called a {nonbalanced} checkbook but i put all like fifty dollars away for clothes for the month or fifty dollars for savings bonds and	3262	A
you know and then when i feel like it i deduct that or so it's kind of a different way to do it but	3262	A
yeah	3262	A
we do and that	3262	A
uh-huh	3262	A
no we don't either we never we use it to float mainly	3262	A
especially on big purchases or around Christmas and	3262	A
yes	3262	A
yeah we i bet we haven't for two or three years or you know once in a while you you have something come up that is more than you can handle or or you thought you could handle and you have to leave a little balance but-	3262	A
we haven't for ages either	3262	A
so far we've always had refunds we you know have we have three children and that seems to really help and	3262	A
but	3262	A
yes	3262	A
i think if we did see that we were starting	3262	A
how are you doing	3262	B
okay well	3262	B
go right ahead	3262	B
now now how long ago was it that you got married	3262	B
nine years okay	3262	B
what type of budget do you have	3262	B
no i mean i mean how do how do you keep do you actually look to see what you have spent each month or do you plan on what you're gonna spend for the month or i mean how do you do your budget	3262	B
okay_1	3262	B
well see now for myself i'm a CPA so needless to say my budget is probably extremely well fine tuned uh i've been married now for nineteen years	3262	B
and every month since the the day that i was married i have had a budget i take all the checks that i write	3262	B
and all the deposits that i make and i put into my computer and it spits out a beautiful financial statement and from the financial statement i can see each month exactly what i have spent	3262	B
to see what i have made and see if there's any profit in leftovers so i can tell if on a month by month basis if i'm spending too much and if i am i just simply go to the wife and say okay time to cut it off you know	3262	B
well it's- it's- it's- you know our budget's so much and you can just you can look at it and you can see hey that on clothing we have spent on this particular month so much more than the average i mean was just way out of proportion	3262	B
for us it always seems to be Christmas time and yeah Christmas and summer uh so i have these financial statement and i look at them_1 month by month by month	3262	B
and i can tell you to the penny how much we have spent in groceries how much we spend in utilities how much we spend on entertainment vacations	3262	B
car- car expenses whatnot and we know what we should be spending and uh now for my wife she's a schoolteacher her income is fixed for for myself i own my own CPA practice	3262	B
so we have a uh uh a floating you know my income is not fixed it can go up it can go down but you've got the generalities you know what it's about it's going to be	3262	B
and so what we look at is is to see behind us because_1 now i do not plan in advance i can not tell you what we're gonna be spending money on in the month of November i don't- i i don't know but i can tell you what we did spend in September	3262	B
and as i see that i can then say okay here we are in October uh so then you know we're we're a little bit short this you know last month we we spent way too much so we need to hold back let's not spend anything this month or next month so that's how i do my budget um	3262	B
uh	3262	B
there was a time when i remember i always wanted to put fifty dollars into my savings account but now it just a matter i want to pay fifty dollars off of my bills that i have you know but uh i- i- i will not allow myself to have a credit card	3262	B
that i now i- i do have a credit card but i don't ever pay or have a balance of more than i can uh payoff	3262	B
yes i use it to float extremely	3262	B
yes i- i enjoy that forty five day float very very much but uh i- i have not paid an interest a penny of interest in the last ten years	3262	B
curiosity only- only because i'm a CPA uh how do you budget for the April fifteenth or do y'all always have a refund or	3262	B
and i- i assume do you own a house	3262	B
good	3262	B
do you have a pet	3218	A
what all do you have	3218	A
huh	3218	A
lot of work	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
i know how that it is because_1 until like a few days ago i had a little Miniature Pinscher	3218	A
and um my parents finally took him to Miami where they are	3218	A
and um it was kind of a pain because i was taking these classes after work so i couldn't leave my dog locked up you know all day and then all night so i'm glad they took him	3218	A
because_1 otherwise i would have a big mess in my apartment when i'd come home you know	3218	A
so	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
um-hum but i'm i'm single so it would keep me company	3218	A
you know there's something you- to come home to and happy to see you	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
protection	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
do the cat and the dog get along or	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
huh	3218	A
did you find it or did you buy it or huh	3218	A
hm	3218	A
hm	3218	A
um-hum it is kind of strange i wonder where they got the the cat from	3218	A
huh-uh	3218	A
huh	3218	A
um um-hum	3218	A
um-hum because_1 that's what i was wondering if you found it or not because_1 it sounded pretty wild	3218	A
huh that's interesting	3218	A
does your husband hunt with the dog or anything or	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
yep	3218	A
oh how neat	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
hm	3218	A
how long have you been living where you live	3218	A
hm	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
um-hum yep i i'm just at the Albany Easy Learning Center	3218	A
um	3218	A
i'm just taking education and psychology courses i'm a teacher and i have a bachelor's in psychology so i'm just trying to brush up on stuff to be a better teacher	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
hum-um nope downstairs they have a gerbil and a	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
um-hum	3218	A
hm	3218	A
um-hum yep	3218	A
can just mess up it's cage you don't have to worry about your whole apartment	3218	A
yep	3218	A
um have you been trying to call in lately and it's been the same topic	3218	A
no	3218	A
it was what	3218	A
really because_1 i've been calling in lately and this is uh my last call that i have to make i think	3218	A
and um every single day for probably about a week it was gun control	3218	A
gun control and i was just about to freak out you know because_1 i already talked with someone about gun control	3218	A
uh-huh you only can talk so much about gun control so hm	3218	A
yes we have two too many at the moment um	3218	B
well we have a um a dog as a golden lab and a um cat and they're both driving us crazy actually they're uh	3218	B
just a just a lot of work and the kids seem to be in so many activities that	3218	B
the reason for having the pets were you know for them and they don't seem to have the time to to care for them so we're at a frustration point with our pets how about you	3218	B
oh	3218	B
what-	3218	B
right	3218	B
yeah	3218	B
that's for sure they're they're a big responsibility they're really fun for especially for the kids if they have the time to enjoy them but	3218	B
boy uh it's a lot of work it seems	3218	B
that's true	3218	B
well i- i enjoy mine if my husband's out of town i enjoy having the dog just for you know he'll he'll bark if anyone comes around or	3218	B
that sort of thing so it is a comfort from that standpoint	3218	B
yeah they do they um	3218	B
they get along fine but the cat doesn't get along with anyone in the family she	3218	B
every time you walk by she grabs- attacks your leg and just hangs on and we've had cats before we've never had one like this so i- i don't know what the deal is with this cat	3218	B
no it was a gift someone gave it to us for my daughter's birthday so um	3218	B
and we you know we had been looking for one so we were hoping to get one but this this one is	3218	B
it was um from uh um Wills Point i don't know if you're familiar with	3218	B
the town you know just outside Dallas and knew somebody that lived in the country so we're wondering if maybe if they were kind of a country outside breed you know um	3218	B
maybe they're just a little too wild or something	3218	B
yeah well	3218	B
but um	3218	B
no no he's not a hunter he he's always liked having big dogs but um doesn't work real well in the city with small yard	3218	B
when we um when we get got the dog we lived out in the country and she could just run and that was fine that that worked real well	3218	B
but now that we're in the city it's kind of hard yeah	3218	B
um we've moved here in January	3218	B
so just not quite a year um you said you're going to school	3218	B
work	3218	B
uh-huh	3218	B
oh good	3218	B
yeah	3218	B
oh well that's good well i- i bet your your kids do you have pets in your classroom or you don't	3218	B
a what	3218	B
yeah	3218	B
yeah	3218	B
seems like our kids have mostly	3218	B
had um guinea pigs and that sort of thing in their classrooms and that's kind of neat you know um the whole class gets to take turns taking it home and	3218	B
and that so a little visiting pet you can you can uh have the fun of it without the total responsibility	3218	B
but that's worked well	3218	B
right	3218	B
really	3218	B
no um let's see i'm trying to think the last time i called in was probably um	3218	B
few days ago it was cooking or something	3218	B
cooking yeah	3218	B
yeah	3218	B
oh	3218	B
get tired of gun control huh	3218	B
this is true yeah	3218	B
well um-hum well do we go until they cut us off or	3218	B
question was on lawn and garden work um how do you like it	3205	A
ooh what kind do you have	3205	A
do they really	3205	A
oh oh and i know somebody that lives there and they never mentioned that problem	3205	A
oh my they probably just take it for granted then	3205	A
ooh yuck no i- i don't have that problem uh it's mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that uh i- i said i'll do inside work you do outside work	3205	A
and so i get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that but i don't like i don't getting dirty	3205	A
and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so um we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall today we just had	3205	A
a lot of rain yeah so it's kind of nice i don't know how yours has been	3205	A
oh i see okay well we're- we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie this is gonna be a switch for us for a week	3205	A
going down there and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity but um as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know uh	3205	A
too much too much about uh how much i really really- do enjoy it myself do you like it at all	3205	A
well how about_1 when you were in Colorado	3205	A
uh-huh	3205	A
well and then and- too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was	3205	A
but uh and with children um you probably don't have time anyhow to to get into it	3205	A
right okay right nice talking with you um-hum bye	3205	A
well i don't do much of it here i'm from uh Texas- from uh Colorado originally and there are no bugs there and i didn't mind getting in the dirt there but boy i'll tell you what once i see these bugs around here i'm just kind of out of it	3205	B
oh roaches and oh yes cockroaches are awful here just awful so i	3205	B
oh you're kidding you're kidding no it's a well maybe they didn't mention it because_1 it's just kind of a fact of life around here and uh	3205	B
it- it must be if they lived here a lot of people i know just say oh i just stomp on them_1 it doesn't matter they make good fertilizer in the garden me personally can't	3205	B
uh-huh	3205	B
uh-huh	3205	B
no i have to you know i have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really	3205	B
hm	3205	B
oh really	3205	B
well it's been real hot here lately i mean we've had to actually have the air conditioning on and everything but uh it's supposed to rain again now uh this weekend	3205	B
so then	3205	B
yeah	3205	B
yeah	3205	B
i well not here i mean it's just here i just can't stand to even get out in the uh in the dirt just	3205	B
well i liked it a little bit but i didn't uh i was working at that time full time and didn't have a lot of time for that and so that i think really um	3205	B
hampered it a little bit	3205	B
yeah	3205	B
no	3205	B
not really i'm fine	3205	B
sounds like it-	3205	B
no no afraid not hopefully they'll get a subject i like one of these times something i really know a lot about well it's nice- nice talking to you	3205	B
okay bye-bye	3205	B
okay what kind of pet do you have Gail	3271	A
oh you have children	3271	A
have you uh what have you had	3271	A
we've had two Schnauzers and before that we had all Dachshunds and i think my husband wants another Dachshund and we're trying to debate because our children are grown and and uh	3271	A
i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a pet- you know another dog and we do have a very loving cat that's you know kind of our baby	3271	A
and uh and we like pets we like them_1 -around we have grandchildren that run through and they think we should have a dog and	3271	A
that's because they have a Great Dane which is huge	3271	A
oh yes yes	3271	A
yes i have never wanted a that's why we've never gotten a female you know in anything and uh uh	3271	A
and our male cat you know we had uh neutered right away and course it he doesn't know it and he's still out partying	3271	A
but um you know i do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her have her spayed you know	3271	A
and uh	3271	A
yes	3271	A
yes yes which i think is a good thing it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved and you know	3271	A
it uh plus uh you know the safety factor and stuff well we enjoy having pets we uh	3271	A
you know i think they're a lot of company and and when my mother lived with us uh the cat was really hers and and he was kind of wild our our daughter found her and brought her to us and uh	3271	A
that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap and she was the only one at first that you know could really hold him you know because_1 he was really skittish but it was like he knew	3271	A
you know and he'd sleep with her and so he was a lot of company to her you know and and just love her and he's cats are usually so independent but this one you know he comes up and he crawls up next to my husband now you know uh	3271	A
uh-huh	3271	A
did he	3271	A
uh-huh	3271	A
uh-huh um-hum i think that's one of the reasons our because as i said our our- Schnauzer was old	3271	A
and so he was becoming incontinent and so then i would generally have messes in the house and i think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with you know	3271	A
and uh and it was new carpeting and you know it just- just really you know upset me no end and uh	3271	A
oh	3271	A
um-hum	3271	A
yes you will you will you know we were trying to decide uh	3271	A
you know about putting him to sleep he was just you know he was getting so old and had that other problems too and and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier	3271	A
you know and and again going through that because our our animals are almost like our kids in some ways you know and and you grieve just as much over them when they go	3271	A
you know as you would a child and and you know our son and and his wife and our daughter and her husband the grandkids all say	3271	A
well i don't i have children i have little children both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets but we've had lots of them_1 in the past	3271	B
um-hum	3271	B
well we had a dog before we moved here uh and we couldn't bring her with us we came from Colorado and we've had hamsters and fish and birds and-	3271	B
cats	3271	B
uh-huh	3271	B
um-hum	3271	B
um yes	3271	B
definitely well	3271	B
we you know if it um if it were just more peaceful you know with the little ones we would definitely have a pet i just think it's nice have around we had a cat though that had kittens so any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered	3271	B
because uh i did that experience was awful	3271	B
um-hum	3271	B
um	3271	B
well a lot of times now when you buy them from like the SPCA or	3271	B
and the humane societies or whatever their adoption includes their spaying	3271	B
so	3271	B
hum-um um-hum	3271	B
oh	3271	B
um-hum	3271	B
yeah	3271	B
uh-hum	3271	B
my husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room but our cat would sleep with us and he hated that	3271	B
um-hum he just thought that they belong- and when he'd- she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that	3271	B
so i guess it's probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though i love cats i think it would probably be a dog and it would definitely be an outdoor animal	3271	B
um-hum oh yeah	3271	B
um-hum oh that would Greg's um my husband's grandparents have a dog and	3271	B
they just it- needs to be put to sleep but it's grandpa's dog and he- he is really getting too old to take care of it but the dog messes all over the carpet and my daughter is just nine months old	3271	B
and so then she crawls on the carpet oh the smell i mean it's just really awful and that's that's one real drawback but	3271	B
you know i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them_1 enough	3271	B
um-hum	3271	B
oh	3268	B
okay- i am after our last summer's vacation i am {antibeach} uh-huh we went to uh Cape Hatteras	3268	B
well we we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland then we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days and uh uh the the waves were huge i've never quite seen waves like this one and uh i was standing in water not more than	3268	B
in just barely above my ankles and uh you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles and i was standing there talking to my daughter and this really big wave came and totally threw me and one	3268	B
well i i love to go and play around at least i always did but although actually my i like the mountains i uh i don't really like hot weather that's my biggest gripe about living here and i basically	3268	B
um-hum yeah i'd i'd like that uh i haven't been to Yellowstone for a long long time and i would uh we've been talking about going there next summer uh i don't know we'll have to to	3268	B
it's been a long time but you know it seems when your family is is different places	3268	B
oh i'm we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and i are both from and	3268	B
my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because_1 we moved down here and uh	3268	B
we've got one of our our kids lives out on the East Coast and so we have to you know go to those	3268	B
you know so just absolutely you know first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to	3268	B
yes that's what i would like to do i have no interest for example in taking a cruise to me why anybody wanna ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling	3268	B
yeah	3268	B
um-hum	3268	B
yeah i just uh that that does absolutely nothing for me	3268	B
but uh i don't know i can say that i think my my favorite spots are still to go to go where there's mountains and and lot of trees and and wildlife to view and and uh	3268	B
i like that kind of stuff i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery	3268	B
um-hum	3268	B
yeah uh i i guess i've never really thought about it that way	3268	B
but i i would like if you know it was anywhere in the world to go i guess even though it's hot i would like to go to Africa	3268	B
well the types of vacations that i usually take i usually come back more tired after my vacation then i do	3268	A
you know before i take it um i need to definitely take a vacation where all all i do is rest and i- i guess to do that i'd probably have to take it at home	3268	A
but um the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida i enjoy the beach	3268	A
{antibeach}	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
right	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
you might be like i am i enjoy i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas but i really don't like to get into water the water the ocean i prefer a swimming pool	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
right i can understand that	3268	A
uh-huh that would be nice	3268	A
uh-huh i know i've taken several vacations to Colorado and i used to live in Colorado oh sometime ago for a couple of years and i really enjoyed that	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
yeah i've never been up to the Yellowstone area so	3268	A
that's right that's right you got that	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
that's right	3268	A
right	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
right	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
it would be sort of confining- i feel like it would be confining	3268	A
you know i would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself	3268	A
uh-huh	3268	A
yes i i agree i can i can do that too and um you know i think if i had if i had the money i would probably go to Europe every year	3268	A
because of you know i think that they have they have it all over there in just a a few tiny two two miles you know there's mountains and there's beaches and it's all right there so	3268	A
um-hum	3268	A
oh	3268	A
right	3268	A
what kind of music do you like	3227	B
um-hum	3227	B
do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even	3227	B
i don't think they have a whole lot to say even	3227	B
yeah i guess	3227	B
uh-huh	3227	B
do you like rap	3227	B
yeah	3227	B
that kind i kind of like some of it is kind of	3227	B
pointless yeah	3227	B
uh-huh	3227	B
yeah yeah	3227	B
yeah	3227	B
i guess i don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the	3227	B
funny more satire kind some times um i'm with you though i like classical um	3227	B
i don't like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway i like easy listening	3227	B
just kind of	3227	B
you know i guess i don't care much for rock and roll any more i	3227	B
used to like it all right but i don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason um	3227	B
let's see country western uh i'm not quite as big on that some of it's okay um	3227	B
yeah	3227	B
uh some of it kind of	3227	B
falls in the rap category i guess so	3227	B
yeah	3227	B
a lot of them_1 sound uh really similar yeah	3227	B
yeah	3227	B
hm	3227	B
well that's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess they don't really	3227	B
has kind of the same sound over and over and the other thing i don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are	3227	B
you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs	3227	B
which	3227	B
yeah	3227	B
yeah earlier things	3227	B
okay well um	3227	A
i am i was thinking about it for a long time and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music	3227	A
um i don't have a whole lot of dislikes i um like jazz um especially the blues and uh	3227	A
i like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from Bach and and Beethoven and Chopin and um	3227	A
just in general everything	3227	A
um i enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh	3227	A
still	3227	A
yeah right right	3227	A
uh well	3227	A
that gets some of the punk	3227	A
um when i was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music and uh	3227	A
a lot of it is has a lot to say or some- some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the the actual	3227	A
uh well it	3227	A
it's it's it really expresses	3227	A
some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music	3227	A
um some of it um it depends i like uh the rap	3227	A
the two types of rap i like or i enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny um and they usually do a lot of satire	3227	A
um	3227	A
right	3227	A
right the monotonous the monotonous no that's not	3227	A
i don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well i'm better than you and blah blah blah i don't like that i like the funny satire and then some of it is	3227	A
some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in	3227	A
urban society it it really does it talks about um race relations and police relations and	3227	A
um that that	3227	A
um-hum	3227	A
um-hum	3227	A
yeah that's that's about my opinion of that	3227	A
it's it's okay um	3227	A
hm the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination	3227	A
behind it the one country and western song sounds like	3227	A
every other country and western	3227	A
and so the the musicians	3227	A
don't get to really get into their music they just play a certain number of chords the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song	3227	A
and	3227	A
hm	3227	A
right	3227	A
yeah and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern the very very modern	3227	A
uh rock and roll but i- i definitely i really enjoy	3227	A
the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies	3227	A
rock and roll	3227	A
and uh	3227	A
i really enjoy especially the sixties uh every-	3227	A
okay while i was waiting for you to connect i- i thought of a couple of menus i decided it'd to be if it's informal or not you know if it was informal i'd probably choose something i mean just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill	3229	A
because_1 that's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it's so nice out	3229	A
um	3229	A
it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something i'm not i'm not into formal dinner parties but	3229	A
i'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread	3229	A
um i have a Pillsbury cookbook i got when i was married but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me then i have some from like church	3229	A
that are more family recipes that are more useful you know budget cookbooks but	3229	A
and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up	3229	A
um i cook a lot the same as as my mom did of course i've added several different recipes but what would you serve or what would you	3229	A
well that's good	3229	A
um-hum	3229	A
uh-huh	3229	A
huh	3229	A
yeah that would be wonderful in these times	3229	A
yeah either they're really fast or	3229	A
uh-huh	3229	A
uh-huh	3229	A
what's one of your favorites	3229	A
uh-huh	3229	A
wow sounds pretty good	3229	A
yeah	3229	A
yeah those Thirty Minute Cookbook	3229	A
that sounds fun i find a lot of the cookbooks that i don't know that you buy over the counter	3229	A
ask for really strange ingredients or things i don't keep on hand all the time	3229	A
and i have young children and our budget's set you know at this time but i want to use	3229	A
simple recipes that i have things on hand i don't have to run to the store to buy	3229	A
or look for something i haven't heard of so that's why sometimes i shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbooks but	3229	A
but well it was interesting talking to you it's a fun subject food is one of my favorite things too	3229	A
anything else you wanted to add	3229	A
oh wow um-hum	3229	A
um-hum that's good	3229	A
uh-huh	3229	A
uh-huh	3229	A
uh-huh	3229	A
that sounds good	3229	A
that sounds really good	3229	A
it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am i'm pretty simple right now but	3229	A
yeah that's probably that's true i have little ones and we and they won't eat you know too many different foods right now so	3229	A
yeah	3229	A
yeah	3229	A
yeah spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so so and it goes a long ways too so	3229	A
all righty we'll talk to you later maybe	3229	A
um-hum	3229	B
um-hum	3229	B
yes	3229	B
i see	3229	B
so what what do you use for cookbooks	3229	B
um-hum um-hum	3229	B
um-hum	3229	B
um-hum	3229	B
um-hum	3229	B
right	3229	B
well i- i- i think we come from from different backgrounds um so the the	3229	B
i- i- i start with different you know have different perspectives that you are i find the Joy of Cooking to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on because it has almost everything in it	3229	B
but on the other hand it's not very inspiring uh it's a good reference when you need to dig something up	3229	B
what we've find very useful is a a book called The Thirty Minute Cookbook i think that's the title uh by Marion Burrows	3229	B
uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes you know the whole meal	3229	B
and so she's	3229	B
yeah now now i- i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes	3229	B
but but they're but they're but they're interesting they're interesting menus um	3229	B
combinations that you wouldn't have normally thought of	3229	B
um	3229	B
um gee the one i had most recently was was one that was- had- she she describes as Jim Beard's favorite um summer menu or something and it consisted of	3229	B
uh grilled kielbasa sausage um a	3229	B
potato salad with olive oil	3229	B
and uh some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there	3229	B
um and that and that was you know that's that that's certain you can do in thirty minutes	3229	B
but there are a whole lot of you know i mean i- i would recommend you look at that book if you're if you are a busy person Thirty Minute Cookbook	3229	B
um-hum	3229	B
um-hum	3229	B
yes yes	3229	B
um-hum	3229	B
yes	3229	B
well you had said dinner	3229	B
you know you know what would i put together for a formal dinner we had- we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night and and um	3229	B
put here here the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert	3229	B
well you know a chocolate mousse recipe	3229	B
and a sort of palate cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken Marabella	3229	B
um which is this wonderful thing you can do um	3229	B
basically you're baking- baking chicken in a in an open pan um having marinated it first hand my my wife did this part so i don't remember all the details but it's marinated in olive oil and some seasoning	3229	B
um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh there's a little bit of brown sugar in there and it bakes up it's a delicious thing and it's easy	3229	B
comparatively so i	3229	B
um	3229	B
i'm sorry i just love food	3229	B
well maybe we had a little more leisure time to do it i don't know	3229	B
yeah	3229	B
i found my kids were very frustrating when they were little	3229	B
in terms of their tastes	3229	B
on the other hand sometimes it was easy they'd you know canned ravioli was was one of their favorites and so it was easy to	3229	B
open a can of ravioli or	3229	B
yes	3229	B
well nice talking to you Cheryl	3229	B
okay bye	3229	B
smart woman	3299	B
yeah we don't we don't uh we didn't when we first got married uh i've been married only about four years my wife always wanted to write something down and keep track and i said look Mary i said you you get money we should save a little bit	3299	B
and uh whatever else you know play it by ear go spend on whatever you spend it on and if at the end of the month	3299	B
our checking account is no good then we got to sit down and and decide what we're going to stop spending it on but until that happens let's not worry about it	3299	B
um and since then we've both been done pretty well regarding uh raises and stuff at our jobs and and our rent has stayed relatively low	3299	B
and now we haven't had that problem yet and then my we we just had our first child about two months ago	3299	B
and then i said well we'll see what happens then because she- she had to take some time off work and she probably will even quit her job now and maybe do some part time work	3299	B
yeah i live in Manhattan i work out in Queens oh which is also part of New York City there's just five boroughs	3299	B
yeah except for i have a a rent um stabilized apartment um so the rent is only seven hundred and fifty dollars a month which for New York is extremely inexpensive in a very good neighborhood	3299	B
yeah i- i- i- i agree the same i mean you know i- i see too many elderly people with my mother uh is a social worker and she works with the elderly	3299	B
and uh you know in in your i don't know how how much older you're- i'm thirty and-	3299	B
yeah uh you're generation has gotten pretty lucky regarding or at least in this area regarding real estate you know they went and bought a house for fourteen thousand dollars and then they they were sixty years old and retired	3299	B
and sold that same house for two hundred fifty thousand dollars and	3299	B
you know moved down to Florida or did whatever they had to do but they had all this capital um i don't know if the real estate market's gonna say the same for one thing i'm thirty i'm an attorney and uh i don't own a house	3299	B
which i think is unusual because all the my parents' friends owned houses when we were growing up and now i grew up in suburbia as opposed to in the city but still	3299	B
um but someday i'd like to own a house and and i i've certainly um make it a point that that i will put some money away um	3299	B
uh maybe a little less now while my wife isn't working so that someday we can have a house and we can that would be our capital and in addition to that i have	3299	B
at work they have you know uh investment plans where you can avoid having to go through um paying taxes but your entire	3299	B
yeah	3299	B
really	3299	B
fourth you have four homes now or four okay	3299	B
yeah- yeah i mean at this point in this area i mean it's it's absolutely ludicrous my	3299	B
my uh just the main you know just the taxes and upkeep of a house would cost me more than i'm paying in rent now obviously i get the-	3299	B
okay	3299	A
i don't have a budget my wife and i- i should make that clear i've been married thirty three years and we've never had and we don't follow budgets but i've got the greatest system going i just don't handle any money	3299	A
and i told her when we got married that i am going to earn so much money and she can spend it on what she wants but if she ever spends more than i earn she's got to go to work she's never gone to work yet so	3299	A
so it worked	3299	A
so it's so you know it's really great	3299	A
so i you know to answer- their question i we don't we don't have a budget	3299	A
um-hum	3299	A
yep	3299	A
um-hum	3299	A
um-hum	3299	A
yeah you live right in New York City	3299	A
uh-huh	3299	A
uh-huh so your rent is quite expensive as compared to what we're accustomed to back here probably	3299	A
oh i see	3299	A
oh yeah yeah	3299	A
well that's great no i can you know again i can see the reason for them_1 i have i have two grown kids and	3299	A
one my youngest son is	3299	A
Ken they both have very very good jobs they live in Chicago they have absolutely no problem they have no need for it and my eldest son he very definitely has to live by a budget because he just cannot control control his finances	3299	A
but i don't you know i cannot see this which i have a very close sister-in-law that everything she does at beginning of the month or every payday she sits- sits down and fills envelopes and i've i find that	3299	A
that's a tedious bore i mean if we had to live like that i'm not so sure i'd want to continue working	3299	A
but for them it works so i mean whatever uh our system works for us we we have a policy my wife and i both that we don't	3299	A
everything we have is ours as far as money we don't holdout- holdout on each other or anything else and never really had a problem but i do believe in	3299	A
uh retirement investment programs very much so	3299	A
uh nowadays you sound like you're fairly young so i you know i keep telling my kids for God's sakes get involved in it because_1 when they retire they should have a half dollars	3299	A
um-hum	3299	A
i'm fifty eight so	3299	A
um-hum	3299	A
yeah	3299	A
um-hum	3299	A
yeah	3299	A
um-hum	3299	A
right oh those things are great i boy i encourage those yeah you're you don't own a house and i'm fifty eight and i just built my fourth home	3299	A
so i just took on another mortgage don't ask me why i really don't but it's tax	3299	A
but this is the fourth one i've owned and this one i built but i'm looking at this as an investment so i hope real estate keeps climbing and it's a brand new area so it should	3299	A
right	3299	A
credit cards is one of my wonderful topics um do you have quite a few or	3297	A
okay	3297	A
uh-huh	3297	A
uh-huh	3297	A
it is	3297	A
oh me too	3297	A
uh-huh	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
that's what kills you on those credit cards	3297	A
uh-huh	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
oh and and with the interest charge on the credit cards you're not getting anywhere because you're paying your interest every month and that's all you're doing	3297	A
and with our Visa that's really high interest we're in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards	3297	A
so that somehow we can get ahead on that	3297	A
but	3297	A
yes	3297	A
yes pay the balance at the end of the month um-hum	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
oh it has	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
it is because_1 you think oh i'll get this and just pay it off later	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
uh-huh	3297	A
no	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
might as well just yeah like you said there's a lot of things that i could probably do without that i don't do without because i have the credit card	3297	A
you know and uh	3297	A
uh-huh yeah uh my husband and i just moved from South Dakota to um Plano Texas and uh that was the thing that helped- helped us get down here	3297	A
and that's what we're trying to get down on that because_1 the credit card helped us move because_1 we had just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving expenses	3297	A
but um now we're in the process of trying to get that down too but it it did help in that kind of a situation	3297	A
but um	3297	A
oh really	3297	A
you're- you're stuck	3297	A
right	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
yeah because_1 you didn't have any other income	3297	A
yep	3297	A
um-hum	3297	A
right and that that's good that's a good feeling not to know	3297	A
uh-huh	3297	A
uh-huh	3297	A
and pay cash	3297	A
i bet	3297	A
i got rid of mine about uh oh it's been about four years ago now	3297	B
and uh went on a strictly cash basis	3297	B
and	3297	B
uh sometimes it's inconvenient but	3297	B
it is so much better for me	3297	B
because i	3297	B
i am the type that will always find an emergency	3297	B
but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need	3297	B
and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging	3297	B
but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy	3297	B
and i'm not paying the high interest rates	3297	B
because it's so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well i'll just pay off the whole balance and then i won't owe any	3297	B
and then something comes up you know and well i'll just pay the minimum well you just do that forever	3297	B
no you're paying interest	3297	B
you know i've i've thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days	3297	B
right and just for ID purposes	3297	B
but it's become such a way of life	3297	B
and	3297	B
like i say it was so convenient	3297	B
and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan	3297	B
to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card	3297	B
uh right	3297	B
so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and i've	3297	B
i've been able to buy as much or more	3297	B
by just going cash and like i say it was tough because it's a really it's a habit	3297	B
or you know you'll think okay i've got x amounts to spend this month and then somebody has a birthday or get they get married or something	3297	B
you think well i'll just put this one thing on it well you don't do that once you start you know you're going to have a bill coming in anyway	3297	B
right	3297	B
and i i just you know for for me it was a trap that was too easy for me to get into	3297	B
uh-huh	3297	B
well you know there are times when	3297	B
you know it is but i i've been	3297	B
laid off twice in the last four years and had i had a lot of credit cards	3297	B
i would- well you know it it really helped that i didn't have that to pay for but in the other vein had i had them_1 i would have lived on them_1	3297	B
right	3297	B
and uh this way you know i i made do	3297	B
and uh	3297	B
when i was you know employed then i didn't have all that that i had to go back and say well i've got ten thousand dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now	3297	B
it really you know with the first like i say it took me over two years to pay mine off but the first time you know that i could go out and make a major purchase	3297	B
and pay cash	3297	B
it was a real good feeling	3297	B
do you or your husband work for TI or	3231	A
oh are you	3231	A
oh i see well that's neat uh-huh	3231	A
so i've worked for them_1 for several years like twelve now i guess	3231	A
well i try to i try to think of myself as young but uh well have you seen any movies recently	3231	A
oh did you	3231	A
no i haven't i have i have a hard time with movies that are real long i don't know	3231	A
yeah	3231	A
yeah	3231	A
well i've heard a lot of good things about it	3231	A
was it	3231	A
uh we my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones we saw the Naked Gun Two and a Half	3231	A
yeah that was that was pretty funny and then we saw	3231	A
what was the spoof on Top Gun	3231	A
it's	3231	A
oh i can't think of what it was called we saw that too that i was pretty disappointed in that one yeah but uh so you know through the summer we have small children so we don't get to see too many but we've seen i guess two or three movies this past summer	3231	A
uh-huh	3231	A
right have you seen Ghost yet	3231	A
i really i enjoyed that movie	3231	A
really	3231	A
uh-huh	3231	A
oh yeah now yeah	3231	A
yeah	3231	A
um-hum	3231	A
oh Van Damme yeah i think	3231	A
right	3231	A
right	3231	A
uh-huh	3231	A
oh Silence of the Lambs yes i did yeah i really enjoyed that a lot	3231	A
uh-huh	3231	A
yeah well it's amazing but really i mean when you stop and think about it uh Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing	3231	A
yeah	3231	A
yeah i do too i really do you know Jodie Foster was good too but i think i think Anthony Perkins was the one that that really made the movie i agree with you	3231	A
oh Hopkins i'm sorry Hopkins yeah i always get those guys mixed up	3231	A
well i- i agree- well i haven't been i'm i saw her in The Accused and i thought that was a pretty good movie i thought she	3231	A
that was that was a pretty uh interesting movie and uh but you know i- i did i really liked the Silence of the Lambs that was really intriguing and it it didn't scare me all that much you know and i- i don't like to go to movies to be scared that's not why i go	3231	A
so	3231	A
right and that one was	3231	A
oh he didn't see it oh	3231	A
uh-huh	3231	A
um	3231	A
uh-huh	3231	A
uh-huh yeah i've seen that it's pretty it's pretty cute i guess you know as far as comedies go probably my favorite is Young Frankenstein i don't know i love that movie	3231	A
yeah so	3231	A
yeah well- Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me but i'm a big uh Mel Brooks fan all his movies i really really enjoy	3231	A
he does	3231	A
oh is that the one with that's he's starring in oh yeah that came out like early in the summer or something i think yeah i haven't seen that one either it	3231	A
oh Blazing Saddles yeah uh-huh	3231	A
oh uh-huh i like i like that one too but i thought Young Frankenstein was better yeah that that was just you know had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie i just really enjoyed it	3231	A
and uh um i'm trying to think because_1 we saw another one that we thought was really good early this summer that was a suspenseful movie	3231	A
i'm trying to remember what it was	3231	A
because_1 it you know it's	3231	A
i'm a contract person at TI in fact involved with uh data switchboard	3231	B
and uh do you work for TI uh-huh	3231	B
oh you sound very young like just out of college	3231	B
uh i'm trying to think we saw uh Dances With Wolves and uh have you seen that one	3231	B
that was excellent	3231	B
well surprisingly enough i do too i get tired of sitting there and so does my husband but we both just thoroughly you know enjoyed it just really liked it	3231	B
and uh i'm trying to think we went to see a uh	3231	B
a real funny one i can't think now what the name of it was i've gone blank	3231	B
oh we have not seen that we want to see that one	3231	B
oh i haven't seen that one	3231	B
were you	3231	B
my husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them_1 he likes to rent them_1 and so we watch a lot of them_1 you know at home as they come out and uh yes yes	3231	B
did you now i- i was real disappointed i'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan and uh i was really disappointed in it it was one i don't think it was as funny as what i was anticipating- anticipating and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny	3231	B
and uh and it wasn't you know at all it was it was more of a love story and uh so i was really disappointed in that because i like him real well we just got through watching one with uh	3231	B
uh is it Claude Van Damme	3231	B
the uh	3231	B
uh the one with Jodie Foster did you see it yes wasn't that excellent	3231	B
yeah that was one that that stayed with me you know for a month i just i kept thinking about it you know	3231	B
no	3231	B
oh it was excellent and and of course he's such a uh very good actor anyway and i think he made the movie	3231	B
you know	3231	B
is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins Hopkins uh-huh i know i know it uh well i'm not a real big Jodie Foster fan but i thought she was good in that	3231	B
no now i didn't see that one	3231	B
no no i like a good suspenseful story and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats in fact i want to uh rent it when it comes out for my husband to see because_1 he didn't he won't go see that no i went with uh our daughter	3231	B
and uh so you know saw it with her and uh enjoyed it my all time favorite is Weekend At Bernie's did you see it	3231	B
uh yes yes my husband liked that	3231	B
uh he's a big Gene Wilder fan	3231	B
uh-huh uh-huh he has a new one out and uh-huh uh i have seen it advertised i don't know what the name of it is	3231	B
um-hum um-hum	3231	B
yes yes	3231	B
and my husband wants to see that one and uh did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the uh	3231	B
the sheriff	3231	B
Blazing Saddles oh that's my husband's all time favorite i think	3231	B
did you	3231	B
okay i'll let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours	3200	A
um-hum	3200	A
well that's that's good especially for these times	3200	A
uh-huh	3200	A
well that's a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system	3200	A
where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason	3200	A
taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form	3200	A
uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period	3200	A
if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about	3200	A
and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month	3200	A
uh-huh that's what i mean it was a hassle	3200	A
um-hum	3200	A
um-hum	3200	A
that's that's kind of hard	3200	A
but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you	3200	A
right	3200	A
right	3200	A
well that's true what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely	3200	A
and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month	3200	A
and	3200	A
yeah we're not there yet	3200	A
um-hum	3200	A
uh-huh	3200	A
that's right that's right	3200	A
um	3200	A
um-hum same here yeah	3200	A
well i could say it's kind of you know that's that's good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have	3200	A
to you know what i'm saying and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday	3200	A
then i think if we could really budget we tried one time- i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years	3200	A
we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener	3200	A
uh-huh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because_1 sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out	3200	A
so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you	3200	A
yeah yeah	3200	A
right right	3200	A
oh how nice	3200	A
uh-huh	3200	A
with	3200	A
well that's good- and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah	3200	A
i think so too	3200	A
so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that that's excellent that's what i'm working toward i think you're probably much ahead of me there and i'm working on it	3200	A
same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get you know yeah	3200	A
yeah	3200	A
that came up yeah	3200	A
uh-huh	3200	A
well that's the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after so	3200	A
rather frugal well that that's gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess we've completed do you think we've been here ten	3200	A
no i- i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible	3200	B
and uh and it's it's sort sort of always worked	3200	B
uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can	3200	B
i guess have self control	3200	B
um-hum	3200	B
uh-huh	3200	B
um-hum	3200	B
yes	3200	B
well yeah i- i couldn't probably be bothered doing- doing that	3200	B
every month and and every since uh well we've been married almost thirty years now but um my- my husband got paid once a month	3200	B
so you learn to get through- you learn to get through you know to the end of the month and uh	3200	B
no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway	3200	B
um-hum	3200	B
well yeah we we tried to to	3200	B
to- or we are paying them_1 off now or there was a time when maybe we didn't pay all of them_1 off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is	3200	B
and for most of uh i mean i'm a substitute teacher and i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so there's only been really one working and uh	3200	B
it it works for me but i can't see that it it would work for probably the majority of people	3200	B
yeah	3200	B
um-hum yeah	3200	B
um-hum it it is when you do it that way	3200	B
well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i- i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks	3200	B
ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the what minuscule amount i made but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card and and it was paid for	3200	B
yes and so i think that that's difficult for most people but then my father was very Scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um	3200	B
yes	3200	B
and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so	3200	B
i uh	3200	B
um-hum	3200	B
well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh	3200	B
and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my we're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars	3200	B
and they were mainly used cars	3200	B
yeah so you know we've been rather rather frugal in that	3200	B
in that respect yeah	3200	B
well each- each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh	3200	B
well let's see as far as i'm	3294	B
well the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have i have young children a baby in the house and and inevitably as soon as they're asleep	3294	B
someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something and i think that that is probably the most	3294	B
aggravating um it- you know it invades my time i'm the one that pays for the phone um	3294	B
if i wanna buy something i'll take the initiative and and go find it you know and it that just really does aggravate me um what do you think	3294	B
your time is is valuable and	3294	B
oh i that's that's interesting i uh uh the market seems to just be growing too i i guess enough people are not speaking out i'm not speaking out that's for sure i just get aggravated about it and	3294	B
i really don't know i'm i'm not into um heavy government legislating- legislating of a lot of different areas but i	3294	B
i don't know i just i do particularly find it annoying um	3294	B
i really not sure i haven't given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know to be	3294	B
well that yeah that might	3294	B
identify themselves yeah	3294	B
right	3294	B
that would be a an an interesting ways yeah	3294	B
right	3294	B
right just	3294	B
oh is that right oh well that's interesting	3294	B
and they just get everybody huh oh boy	3294	B
well i i do wish that it would stop on my end because_1 it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments	3294	B
and i i guess the the next one is is door-to-door solicitors i don't mind the children when they're selling things for school i have kids and you know that's just kind of part of it but when	3294	B
it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about_1 ten o'clock in the morning um that really it just- makes you not feel particularly safe and it's annoying as well	3294	B
right you just- you really don't know so i- i find myself being a little- a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than i might normally be but i- i do feel like it's a an invasion of my space and uh	3294	B
i've never quite understood the purpose of that yeah i uh	3294	B
just to keep-	3294	B
just a survey	3294	B
yeah	3294	B
there've been a couple of times when the it- the uh whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it and then there have been several times when i just said well i just really don't have the time	3294	B
you know to deal with it at that moment	3294	B
but um i don't get too many of those i've had just a few	3294	B
um generally someone's trying to sell me something or	3294	B
right right	3294	B
right with	3294	B
yeah that's right	3294	B
oh well-	3294	B
right	3294	B
yeah	3294	B
well we	3294	B
that's true	3294	B
yeah you just never know i guess	3294	B
that yeah i i	3294	B
asking for information is is i can't really see that	3294	B
i think they ought to if- if- if if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp and you know when it arrives at your house oh i	3294	B
so so what gets you	3294	A
um-hum	3294	A
um-hum	3294	A
well i mean i that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said although in my case it's my wife and i both work we come home	3294	A
and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings and it's one solicitation call after another and	3294	A
you know	3294	A
yeah it's it's like you say very annoying and um why why do we let this happen	3294	A
would would you mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate	3294	A
yeah it it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't wanna receive calls like that	3294	A
and the people making these calls would be obliged to compare- compare	3294	A
the their lists that they're gonna call against this list of people who don't wanna be called	3294	A
um	3294	A
and that that way those who want it can have it and those who don't want it don't have to have it	3294	A
sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers	3294	A
um automatically and	3294	A
right	3294	A
yeah	3294	A
um-hum	3294	A
yeah	3294	A
um-hum	3294	A
yes	3294	A
and these and these people may in fact be just looking to steal- find an unoccupied house to rob	3294	A
um-hum	3294	A
yeah	3294	A
what about these telephone callers sometimes they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone callers who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire	3294	A
well i think these people are hired by from from different sources	3294	A
um with you know and so therefore there's no one answer but but	3294	A
yeah sometimes it's a market survey- basically it's a market survey but they never say who who they're really working for or what you know what what what questions are you know	3294	A
yeah	3294	A
yeah	3294	A
yeah	3294	A
yeah	3294	A
right well and sometimes that's this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too	3294	A
other times it's you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for their	3294	A
marketing purpose for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider but but a dollar isn't it you know it's uh	3294	A
and i also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people give away personal information um	3294	A
when when the call comes and and they uh uh you know sort of seductive to you know somebody's asking me my -opinion on all of these things and so i start answering and then you you know you go down a path um	3294	A
and you don't know where it's gonna end uh	3294	A
in fact you don't even know what you've eventually you know the totality of what you've revealed and you know	3294	A
this isn't you know probably- most likely not to going to be used against you but it could and	3294	A
and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed	3294	A
because it's subject to abuse and it	3294	A
you have an opinion about civil stuff	3289	A
right	3289	A
um-hum	3289	A
yes	3289	A
oh i do too	3289	A
okay you're	3289	A
you're you're self-employed so you're not	3289	A
reimbursed by anyone	3289	A
okay uh yeah that that's interesting point i i i'm not an enthusiast for juries particularly	3289	A
and i think especially in in civil cases i doubt doubt the effectiveness of it i hadn't thought about it from terms of the cost point of view to providing the jury	3289	A
i think	3289	A
we may be the only major country today that still uses juries in civil trials	3289	A
i'm pretty sure Britain has has uh given up juries in civil cases	3289	A
well probably judges	3289	A
would be the people you decision about_1 whether to use juries or decision-	3289	A
i mean i i i think	3289	A
it would be better to have them have judges trained professionals deciding such things	3289	A
um i don't know there's any Constitutional- way to do that other than to change the Constitution	3289	A
um-hum	3289	A
uh	3289	A
no i don't think- i guess different states have different rules on that	3289	A
i	3289	A
this is because- because of not who initially comes in but who's selected out of the panel uh okay certainly both sides	3289	A
pick criteria by which	3289	A
they wanna wanna judge juries and and uh veto lots of those and i suspect	3289	A
that uh well see likely to get off that way although it it'll vary	3289	A
um	3289	A
i mean i guess traditionally juries are supposed to do findings of fact as opposed to findings of law	3289	A
and deciding	3289	A
well that that varies by state and locality as to whether the	3289	A
uh there is a little basis for comparison	3289	A
well i guess i feel much more comfortable with with judges either-	3289	A
i'm ready okay	3289	B
well you know when to me when you're talking about juries there's there's two types of juries you've got the civil juries and then you've got the criminal juries now the criminal juries	3289	B
my understanding of those where a person has done some crime and you're trying to determine that they need to go to jail or not and then if he does for how long the civil jury does it matter of	3289	B
you owe me some money or you think that i owe you some money and we can't get it resolved so we go to the jury and we're ask we're gonna ask that jury to uh make a decision as to who owes who and for how much	3289	B
i'm sorry i have a problem with that	3289	B
because first of all i'm a working person and i need to get paid for my day of work and if the our juries only pay us seven dollars and fifty cents for a full day of work	3289	B
i think it's wrong that two people have a dispute they had a little car wreck and maybe one owes the other guy five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars whatnot and they're going to call me away from work	3289	B
for seven dollars and fifty cents to make a decision as to who owes who and how much to me that is what we pay our judges to do	3289	B
i am self-employed that's right	3289	B
i'm not going to be reimbursed by no one	3289	B
but i mean isn't- isn't that what we have the elected officials who supposedly is unbiased who can't aren't they supposed to have a head on their shoulders to make these decisions	3289	B
no decision as to whether or not as far as civil's concerned	3289	B
true	3289	B
you're probably right but it that's still my as far as i'm concerned i just think it's wrong to use a jury for the civil matters now you can talk about_1 criminal matters	3289	B
uh i've got no problem with that one because you know here you're talking about uh	3289	B
has a person fit into society has he followed the rules of society	3289	B
i've i've got no problem at all with using your peers quote quote	3289	B
and helping to make decisions although we'd have problems as to who qualifies to be on that uh jury and i think some of the the	3289	B
manipulative rules that they use to say that all the rich and famous cannot be on a jury but all the poor dregs can be you know it doesn't- it doesn't make sense	3289	B
well it it- it what- amount to if you're if you're rich if you got money	3289	B
and your really high on society somehow another you're going come up with a one of these excuse that the the the judge gonna say yeah you're excused you don't have to be here	3289	B
but if you are some poor old uh blue collar worker who you know uh just trying to eke out a living and uh i work from eight to five and	3289	B
you know for some reason he's not gonna find an excuse to get out	3289	B
and so we typically find our juries made up of some of the dumbest people rather than the smarter people	3289	B
right	3289	B
true	3289	B
but then they but then they also have to make the decision as to how long that person should serve	3289	B
okay and and there most juries don't even know what the hell they even talking about	3289	B
and then when you get someone who says okay this person should be convicted for thirty years two years later they're on probation	3289	B
because the jury doesn't know and in in the state of Texas i don't think you are allowed uh the jury's not allowed to be told how soon that person would be off on probation	3289	B
only thing that they can do is determine how long they should be put in jail	3289	B
not knowing what the rest of the rule is which i think is unfair	3289	B
well i still don't trust them_1 i'm sorry	3241	A
i probably never will	3241	A
uh-huh	3241	A
that's right i don't trust maybe i guess it's because of the way what happened over there with their own people how they threw him out of power and	3241	A
you know just a big uproar but then you know me and my husband always talk about it because they're running out of money	3241	A
you know and what are they going to do when they run out of food are they going to just attack us and take it it makes you wonder	3241	A
because you know we already we have enough problems over here that we don't need to be trying to help everybody else which that that gets on my nerves too but	3241	A
yeah	3241	A
yeah but i don't i think they have just as much see but- i don't know i- i think that they have better like we you know when we go over in Iraq and Iran that's different country but i think see that's why they don't have anything in the Soviet Union they spent more money	3241	A
on um what do you call um military power than anything they have more of a expense of military than we do	3241	A
well now see that's another problem is they have it in their own thing with all this uh what do you call it uh	3241	A
breaking up of the Soviet Union right now i doubt if they had a help of anybody in their country	3241	A
they're having so many	3241	A
right now it's like whoa so i don't know if they would have	3241	A
you know but it just depends on when	3241	A
they do it so i guess it would depend on what what state that they're in	3241	A
when they do it but i still wouldn't trust them_1 not i would trust them_1 only so much	3241	A
um-hum	3241	A
doing what you supposed to do	3241	A
but i think that's what they're trying to do is to get us to do everything you know and them not really do anything because_1 who's checking them	3241	A
you know i think that not only if we check them_1 they're not going it's just like coming over here in the United States the government don't tell you everything	3241	A
they feel they don't have to which i agree	3241	A
because_1 if you tell everybody everything everybody in the world would know because they'd put it on TV	3241	A
and that wouldn't do us any good so	3241	A
they're so into TV	3241	A
um-hum	3241	A
um-hum	3241	A
that we really don't that we don't know about	3241	A
how much of it is true and how much and how much of it is propaganda	3241	A
you know what are- what are- what are we supposed to believe	3241	A
but i don't i don't trust the government here more than i trust you know to a point	3241	A
but then just like i'm not going to trust another government just because	3241	A
there's no way	3241	A
especially when they've been such a	3241	A
oh	3241	A
a power to us you know a force that we have to watch constantly a threat but yet now they're going to be our friends	3241	A
no that's like Little Red Riding Hood to me	3241	A
we're going to sit here but we're not we're going to watch each other	3241	A
and i think whoever wins the the wait	3241	A
is probably the one	3241	A
yeah as long as i don't care about that they can do whatever they want but	3241	A
i don't want it to get to-	3241	A
hi	3241	B
you don't	3241	B
i don't i don't think they have enough control to really uh	3241	B
to really do anything against us i think- i don't think they're as strong as we think they are	3241	B
personally but yeah but i see what i see your point because_1 you know they they feed us propaganda	3241	B
and we never know what they're thinking	3241	B
right	3241	B
sure	3241	B
right	3241	B
right	3241	B
well i think taking you know when we	3241	B
took that uh went to war with Iraq i think we that was kind of a uh display of power	3241	B
and i think we showed- i think the Soviet Union knows what we have and knows	3241	B
that we're pretty serious and if they ever tried to do anything	3241	B
we would we would be on the offensive	3241	B
yeah but are they going to have the backing from the people	3241	B
you know	3241	B
right	3241	B
right because there's fifteen different republics	3241	B
yeah	3241	B
right	3241	B
right	3241	B
well	3241	B
right i don't- i don't even think we should- you know i- i don't think it's a matter of trust even anymore i mean it's just	3241	B
okay you lay this down we'll lay this down but that doesn't mean we we're not we're going to stop watching you and making sure you're not	3241	B
you know	3241	B
right	3241	B
i don't know	3241	B
i know it	3241	B
right	3241	B
right	3241	B
right i just a you know	3241	B
that that's another thing that scares me is our country	3241	B
you know what are we doing	3241	B
what are they actually telling us and after you know what happened the other day with that uh CIA guy you know	3241	B
how much is what all the wars we're getting into and all this you know the messes we're we're involving us ourselves with	3241	B
right is that true or you know is it	3241	B
was Panama really a threat	3241	B
right	3241	B
right	3241	B
that's the thing i'm having a hard time with	3241	B
right	3241	B
right	3241	B
um-hum	3241	B
huh	3241	B
yeah really	3241	B
well if it just keeps on going and nobody ever does anything that's fine with me	3241	B
uh some	3282	B
yeah i think it kind of uh it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war	3282	B
but uh	3282	B
we definitely need something there with all the hostages and	3282	B
what all	3282	B
um-hum	3282	B
yeah	3282	B
oh well you know i just see this Middle East situation with with Russia and	3282	B
everything there that's happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down and i see the Middle East as being you know the real hot spot of the future so to speak	3282	B
so i guess i view- view it as being the prime importance as far as	3282	B
trying to negotiate trying to	3282	B
wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there	3282	B
um-hum	3282	B
yeah	3282	B
um-hum	3282	B
i guess the question in my mind somewhat and and it depends on the country you know i think some are more peaceful than others	3282	B
if you look at um Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the UN going in there and the the	3282	B
bomb development and all this kind of stuff you know uh gosh i think you know we should have	3282	B
got him while we could	3282	B
or whatever	3282	B
and i think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the Middle East you know that's this constant fighting you know and	3282	B
yeah i think they they look at force as a way of	3282	B
you- you know their their means to their ends	3282	B
and um so i you know i don't know so much if these peace talks are gonna	3282	B
i don't know how much they'll stay to them you know if if even if we say that we're going to do stuff i don't know how they'll stick to that	3282	B
um-hum	3282	B
uh-huh that's probably a bonus on our part	3282	B
yes it is	3282	B
um-hum	3282	B
yeah	3282	B
i tend to agree with you you know i think they have in mind what they want to do and i think	3282	B
a lot of times their slogan is might makes right	3282	B
and you know it kind of the forceful	3282	B
you know i don't know i- i just don't think peace is	3282	B
uppermost in their minds	3282	B
uh-huh	3282	B
yeah	3282	B
uh all right Carolyn do you are you reading the papers about the the Middle East summit	3282	A
yes i'm just a little bit too i think um i think i was worn out- worn out from Middle East after the war	3282	A
um-hum	3282	A
yeah yeah what- that's i think uh i don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back i think that's really uh	3282	A
really important i- i- i- can't- i guess we grew up in such a different world i could never even imagine taking hostages	3282	A
but i think they just have a whole different world than we do so i don't know but i don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be	3282	A
um	3282	A
yeah	3282	A
um-hum	3282	A
yeah i think um	3282	A
i don't know i have uh i just have this this civil rights mentality i- i guess you know should we or or you know should- should we	3282	A
uh those i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do	3282	A
and i guess that's what i- i hope for them but some of them don't want those freedoms i think their their religious beliefs may um	3282	A
may not you know they may not want it as a whole so i think that's something that has to be considered too but i think that's a that's really a long term	3282	A
type thing i don't know the the it said think about long term repercussions and i was just thinking well peace is peace you know and that's really is the nicest thing	3282	A
um-hum yeah	3282	A
yeah	3282	A
um-hum	3282	A
yeah yes i- i think so i think um	3282	A
right i think i think they realized we would probably never push him out and uh i think the other probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out because_1	3282	A
um-hum	3282	A
yeah yep	3282	A
um-hum	3282	A
yeah	3282	A
i- i think the the thing is though i- i guess	3282	A
the	3282	A
the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas- ideas that that coincide with the the US ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union	3282	A
and i guess that's all gone i think that's really uh probably what started the whole process i	3282	A
yeah	3282	A
i think i think that they're so- they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support	3282	A
from the Soviet Union so i guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries from- two ways we can either act like we're gonna be	3282	A
pro communist or act like we're going to be pro uh	3282	A
pro democracy and whatever gets us the most out of it that's what we'll act like we're going to do but we really won't change in the long run i think that's the way i sort of see them all working you know	3282	A
yeah	3282	A
um-hum	3282	A
yeah it's it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis i always find it very hard in my heart	3282	A
to align- to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs you know but then again they have to live in that environment they have to be subjected to	3282	A
all of the Arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever and they have to negotiate	3282	A
almost everything and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else	3282	A
but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of like i don't know logically	3282	A
-okay	3261	A
um i don't know if you wanna start first okay basically um we're not in the city we're out in the country and uh we were living in the city and i think uh crime has escalated quite a bit just from the	3261	A
uh short time we were in the city their crime and murders alone this is in uh city of Minneapolis and that's	3261	A
quite a ways from uh you know uh other cities like New York and uh Detroit and all of that but	3261	A
just in particular crime has escalated quite a bit in murders i mean with guns and teenagers not so much um with people that are in their later twenties or thirties or whatever it's basically people that are um	3261	A
sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen nineteen years old killing each other um and there's like one a day so that kind of gets to the point that you uh from the years before it wasn't quite as much so	3261	A
uh-huh	3261	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3261	A
oh wow	3261	A
yeah oh definitely for you guys sure and like i said in Minneapolis it was basically uh one a day every night you were hearing about a murder whether it was uh between gang related murders or	3261	A
uh somebody in the wrong spot at the wrong time that kind of thing and uh teenagers killing each other or random shootings just basically shooting a gun into somebody's house as they drive by or shooting somebody on the street just because they didn't even know them_1	3261	A
but i think what's happening is um at least in Minneapolis um the i think that people are getting fed up with it and just this morning was uh reading uh or watching a TV program on women carrying guns	3261	A
to protect themselves against um crime and i'm all for it i mean when it comes to if somebody's gonna do crime against me they're going to uh you know	3261	A
if if i have a gun i'll shoot them_1	3261	A
i won't even think twice about it just simply because my safety comes first and that person that's uh doing something against me would uh get shot but	3261	A
i'm an old country girl that a long time ago learned how to shoot a gun and i'm not afraid of a gun and i guess-	3261	A
yeah it's hard like with uh in our home we have a gun in the home but i don't go out and carry it around with me in my purse but	3261	A
it comes down to i think a lot of New York women do from what i've been hearing is that New York and uh other cities that have such a high crime rate in the subways and that are starting to carry guns so	3261	A
sure	3261	A
uh-huh sure	3261	A
well he did it out of a pure vengeance and i think he murdered just purely because of his but if you're um up against a gang of boys or teenagers	3261	A
yeah	3261	A
right exactly if he had shot them and uh shot them or wounded them or even shot just basically	3261	A
straight clear on onto their face or whatever if he felt that he was uh that much of a victim i think uh the court system would've looked at it a little bit differently but he bluntly just shot them even after they were i think down on the ground	3261	A
not moving uh or whatever but uh i think there's a justification of where people say	3261	A
uh most of the people are fed up with crime so when you're gonna get juries you're gonna get juries of people saying well you know this guy asked for it or this person asked for it or whatever	3261	A
and i think you're gonna find less and less juries uh saying well the the the victim should be put on trial for it um	3261	A
no no that was in uh Wisconsin that was in Milwaukee area yeah so you know you've got things like that if maybe those guys would have carried a gun they could have shot him right then and there before he the guy um	3261	A
got them but it's- it's just the idea that i think people are more aware of crime so i don't know i think people i don't know what's gonna happen in the future either people are going to be going back to the old west and carrying a guns	3261	A
then you've got to pay for them_1 in prison though so i don't know	3261	A
uh-huh	3261	A
uh-huh	3261	A
uh-huh	3261	A
you can start	3261	B
sure	3261	B
so i'd think it's more than that actually	3261	B
i think uh i i it's funny you mentioned New York first because that's where i live uh in New York City um i think they had two thousand murders last year so that's like uh six a day	3261	B
it's a little different in the city sometimes you know that's	3261	B
i mean that yes it's a problem though it wasn't even- you know that's how it when Bernie Goetz i- i mean that guy a few years ago that shot someone in the subway could've hit someone that was just sitting there	3261	B
i you know his- that that's the problem with guns in in New York and	3261	B
sure	3261	B
well that's that's what happened with him but then he ended up shooting the guy in the back	3261	B
sure yeah	3261	B
that's right that was in Minneapolis wasn't it oh	3261	B
oh Milwaukee okay	3261	B
sure	3261	B
sure it's um it's it's weird it's it crime is a a weird thing too because- as far as like the people that perceive it as a problem and the actuality of it because like i live in New York City and-	3261	B
okay	3203	B
we have a uh four bedroom split brick home in in Richardson actually	3203	B
and uh we bought it back in about nineteen seventy three	3203	B
so we've seen it gone up in value wise real well yes	3203	B
yes yes it it looks like all the others it's uh	3203	B
uh-huh	3203	B
oh i know where that is yeah	3203	B
yes you're in the the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings and uh-huh those- those are lovely	3203	B
oh oh nice	3203	B
yes	3203	B
um have you um found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings	3203	B
are they uh-huh well i would expect so i have wondered about the cooling and the heating especially the cooling	3203	B
wow uh-huh	3203	B
well how many bedrooms do you have in your home	3203	B
oh uh-huh	3203	B
oh how nice huh	3203	B
uh-huh	3203	B
that's a pretty good size room	3203	B
well that's neat	3203	B
well it sounds like a real nice one	3203	B
right where did you move from	3203	B
oh uh-huh	3203	B
uh-huh do you like the Dallas area	3203	B
and i imagine that you have found that the homes uh here are uh a much better value down here aren't they than there	3203	B
oh really now that's interesting	3203	B
um-hum	3203	B
well that's interesting because i've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes you know are that good down here and uh so that's interesting	3203	B
oh well that's good well i know our as i said our house is about seventeen years old and uh	3203	B
we've been very pleased with it we've had no major problems with it knock on wood and uh	3203	B
you know it is with huh withstood you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it all the time so and we like our neighborhood it it has has grown and the majority of the people you know keep up the neighborhood	3203	B
and that's very important and and as i said it it has risen- risen in value	3203	B
but we bought back when housing was so low and you know and now it- you know it then it started jumping by leaps and bounds it seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit but we're still fine	3203	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3203	B
yes	3203	B
it should bring up your values- property values a little bit your pricing	3203	B
uh-huh i think once the economic situation in the Dallas area improves i think housing will go up	3203	B
you know right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs and everything so that's you know that keeps the prices down	3203	B
and value down and i sure the tax uh or appraisal district would like for it to go up	3203	B
that's right that's right	3203	B
ready	3203	A
what type of home do you have in Dallas	3203	A
uh-huh	3203	A
oh good	3203	A
and it's probably typical of your neighborhood	3203	A
i'm in Plano just you know north of where you live	3203	A
and uh we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago	3203	A
so my home is typical it's a a brick home a two story brick home and it's typical of of the other homes in our neighborhood too	3203	A
yeah	3203	A
yeah the the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling we're from the north and we just couldn't stand the wasted space	3203	A
so we had them_1 we have a high entry hall and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to um nine feet so we could get bedrooms above	3203	A
so that way we we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area but we don't have so much wasted space	3203	A
and we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way	3203	A
mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood	3203	A
yeah	3203	A
yeah	3203	A
right i know our air conditioner during the summer we it's over three fifty a month	3203	A
yeah just to air condition it so	3203	A
i have uh a master bedroom and a den on the main floor and then upstairs i have	3203	A
three bedrooms and i have i'm a writer and i work in my home so above the garage area i have a studio	3203	A
so it's not really a bedroom it doesn't have a closet and it and it's the size of a three car garage	3203	A
so that's where i work yeah	3203	A
yeah so we this is our dream home and we just absolutely love it i	3203	A
yeah we're we're really proud of it i just hope we never have to move again this is our	3203	A
uh Detroit this last time we were there two years and	3203	A
oh we love it	3203	A
yes and they're much much better constructed down south than they are up north too the	3203	A
um-hum the quality of the workmanship	3203	A
we noticed a tremendous difference up north they just kind of throw them together because_1 we had homes built in in Detroit also	3203	A
and they just didn't care if the trim work didn't line up it's just that's just what you get	3203	A
oh	3203	A
yeah well the carpenter and painter and you know everybody the marble man	3203	A
were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built and they'd say just look at this it you know they seemed so proud of everything they did	3203	A
and it really made a difference to us	3203	A
yes	3203	A
oh	3203	A
yes	3203	A
uh-huh that's important too	3203	A
um-hum	3203	A
oh	3203	A
yes	3203	A
yeah ours is pretty much level in the two years that we've been there we're hoping it takes off again but	3203	A
i don't know with the EDS building and Penny's and everything going in up on Legacy we're hoping that brings in more people	3203	A
that's what we're hoping because_1 we're we're just real close to to where that is so	3203	A
uh-huh	3203	A
i hope so too	3203	A
yes	3203	A
yeah	3203	A
yes i'm sure for that reason it can stay the same but	3203	A
but we love being where we are	3203	A
yes	3206	B
uh yes it's about why there aren't more people that are voting and participating in	3206	B
oh absolutely	3206	B
um i think that uh	3206	B
it's kind of discouraging to um i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not	3206	B
a lot of them_1 are so ill informed they have no idea	3206	B
you know even there's- there's an election or	3206	B
and these are people that are registered	3206	B
well that's a thought	3206	B
hm i don't know i- i like that idea um	3206	B
oh i had a though just a second ago but it slipped my mind um	3206	B
one thing that i- that i think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates	3206	B
and i think sometimes you know that's one thing that i have learned in working- working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like	3206	B
i know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for and when they got in office it was just a disaster	3206	B
uh and and i'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them_1	3206	B
absolutely	3206	B
that's right	3206	B
now if you just lose if you just skip one election	3206	B
three	3206	B
um-hum	3206	B
i think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it	3206	B
no excuse i- i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that or not	3206	B
um-hum	3206	B
oh i think that's great uh	3206	B
actually you know my husband has run for office before and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because you know if you're gonna be tied up that day	3206	B
uh campaigning or whatever it might be um that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know you can just go ahead and get that taken care of and	3206	B
um-hum	3206	B
um-hum	3206	B
well hopefully once they have uh	3206	B
you know once they've checked them off the list they they do have to check them_1 off a list	3206	B
when they vote so hopefully they couldn't	3206	B
yeah are you there	3206	A
okay do you know the question for today	3206	A
and what is your feeling do you think this is	3206	A
vital importance	3206	A
okay do you	3206	A
i	3206	A
it- i have worked in some campaigns and it's the most discouraging thing in the world i'm originally from Oklahoma	3206	A
and up there if they miss three elections	3206	A
then they have to reregister and i have often wondered if if maybe that would help the situation i don't know	3206	A
well can you come up with anything else that maybe	3206	A
we could do to these people	3206	A
oh that's it's	3206	A
well	3206	A
i'm- i'm i'm not sure- the only thing is if they don't vote they have no right to complain	3206	A
it is um i don't know why we are so complacent	3206	A
but i'm gonna vote each time right or wrong i'm gonna cast a ballot and then if i'm unhappy with it i have the right to express my opinion	3206	A
so uh there was something else i was gonna	3206	A
and i'm like you i've just lost a train of thought that i had but they have been more little more	3206	A
effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it	3206	A
no three you have to you have to skip three	3206	A
and um course those can be they can be	3206	A
oh a long time apart but um	3206	A
of course what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting	3206	A
okay	3206	A
i'm sure all over the state of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting	3206	A
and you don't have to have- be sick out of town or anything there- there is no excuse anyone can go and vote	3206	A
do you	3206	A
but that is an excuse and that would i could live with	3206	A
but this idea of anyone well- i just- i am so bitterly opposed to this if you're busy that has always been a legitimate excuse	3206	A
if you are incapacitated ill health but to have the expense of	3206	A
let's see they have five six people at my polling place they can come from all over the city and i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this	3206	A
yes i know	3206	A
but is there is every list checked as thoroughly as a you know we back in it when i lived	3206	A
okay we're being recorded	3291	A
uh number one i am one hundred percent for total gun -control- control	3291	A
i uh	3291	A
yes i am not a member of the National Rifle Association and i don't believe in hunting and uh i just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate and i really feel that we have to do something	3291	A
in order to uh to	3291	A
hm	3291	A
um-hum	3291	A
no- no there's only one problem i have with the whole thing though that- is you know when they do it i think our biggest problem is yes the	3291	A
the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available	3291	A
i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available and the types of the weapons i mean there is no	3291	A
right there is	3291	A
there is no reason for it i mean and you know when people say you know well my God they're they're	3291	A
cutting into my civil liberties and all this no i- i- i take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there then somebody is taken away from my civil liberties	3291	A
and uh	3291	A
maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun -control- control that's that's really not what i meant by i mean we need control we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the in the public	3291	A
um-hum	3291	A
hm	3291	A
um-hum	3291	A
yes all right you you sound like you're into the technology of it which is yeah i agree and you know and again i'm my entire family are	3291	A
they- they are all hunters and you know they they don't appreciate my stand and i i have no i really have no problem with sports hunters	3291	A
i really don't it's just that when they come on and they say they need an Uzi in order to do some accurate or	3291	A
decent deer hunting	3291	A
i think i think that's totally outrageous what's happening is people are losing they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue	3291	A
and the issue is the issue is becoming the focus and not what is actually happening with guns uh i i think something will happen there will	3291	A
all right Ron	3291	B
total gun control	3291	B
yes i- i agree something should be done but i there i don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons because	3291	B
crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct	3291	B
will have access to weapons from somewhere	3291	B
and that means they'll always have an advantage over us and uh they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself now	3291	B
you know i- i agree with a lot of things you just said in your few moments because personally i used to be a great hunter and in the last few years i've said no way matter of fact if i find a uh	3291	B
a a fly running around in the house i pick him up and carry business of wanting to go out and shooting and and killing and that sort of thing	3291	B
but i think that uh personally that we do need some	3291	B
weapons available to most of the people most of the people really are uh honest and uh	3291	B
worthy of carrying on their lives properly uh i'm sort of in- in line thinking in terms i don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period	3291	B
is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon	3291	B
i mean there's nothing wrong with that do you see anything wrong with that	3291	B
right	3291	B
yeah i'm against- i'm against this uh automatic and semiautomatic stuff i don't think we should have access to those	3291	B
no	3291	B
hm	3291	B
yes and the the people should be uh selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're they're not uh acquiring weapons for illicit use	3291	B
uh that is not good there's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms as a matter of fact um there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who- who uh brought to me a target	3291	B
from- from a rifle that he uh	3291	B
pretty well halfway designed and he and he put together the uh the bullets in it and he was showing me that at a hundred yards he kept five shots	3291	B
within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards now see from a technical point of view that is something that that our military people need to know about	3291	B
so there are other interesting uh facets in in guns and weapons this is a uh bolt action rifle i think he has and he has done other things to the way the uh barrel sits in the uh	3291	B
the wood part of it and uh he designed the the the bullets themselves and he has fantastic accuracy	3291	B
just just from a technical point of view that interests me not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate	3291	B
um-hum	3291	B
yeah	3291	B
yeah	3291	B
um-hum	3291	B
oh i tell you i thought uh this is a great topic for me because_1 i love to eat out my husband says i'd eat out every meal if i could	3222	A
um i like well my favorite restaurant in the whole uh Dallas area is uh Siciliano's A Taste of Italy i love Italian food and they have wonderful garlic rolls and	3222	A
all of their entrees are wonderful have you ever heard of that place	3222	A
there's one on Arapaho right at the intersection of Arapaho and Jupiter and then there's one i live in Garland and it	3222	A
yeah there's another one over here real close to my house at Walnut and Shiloh but they've built some more there's one over in the Hurst area of Fort Worth and	3222	A
yeah	3222	A
yeah it is the atmosphere is okay i mean it's kind of dark and has candle lit tables and that kind of thing but it's not a real fancy place you know it's just the food is just really exceptional and they give you real big quantities	3222	A
and it and all their entrees come with like a salad and soup and all the rolls you can eat and so by the time you get your food you're already full	3222	A
yes	3222	A
oh oh well you could go there what i do sometimes for lunch is uh just just get like soup and salad and eat their garlic bread because it's so delicious yeah	3222	A
yeah well um what's your favorite place	3222	A
oh you like Mexican i like that too	3222	A
oh	3222	A
yeah	3222	A
uh-huh yeah	3222	A
well that's neat	3222	A
yeah well that's my main thing too	3222	A
yeah yeah	3222	A
yeah yeah that is a real noisy place	3222	A
i've only been there a couple of times but the the times i was there i felt like my head was echoing when i was trying to talk	3222	A
yeah	3222	A
yeah yeah i know what you're talking about well we have a a restaurant down here a lot of people won't even eat there but uh we like it it's Pancho's have you ever been there Mexican buffet uh-huh	3222	A
oh uh-huh	3222	A
yeah oh yeah well they have a chili relleno or chili relleno um-hum	3222	A
they're really good and they uh the plates the thing i like about this place is they bring you all the chips and stuff you can eat plus they bring sopapillas as many as you want	3222	A
so you know a lot of places you have to order that separately yeah oh it's really nice and the children eat free we have two kids and	3222	A
one of them eats free the other one's up above that age but she still gets a you know reduced price yeah so it's a real good deal for a family to go and you can just really get full	3222	A
yeah	3222	A
well i like i really prefer to go you know some place where i sit down and someone waits on me but um my kids of course both love McDonald's and uh McDonald's- Burger King anything that's got a place to play	3222	A
so i spend time at those places too because i know how much they enjoy we go to Show Biz a lot but do you have children	3222	A
um Show Biz is the noisiest place you can imagine because_1	3222	A
right that's right it they have a wonderful area to play you know they have big balls and games and rides and i mean all kinds of stuff it's like a little bitty amusement park in there	3222	A
and it's really fun they have these uh puppets that get up and sing and dance and you know so it's real entertaining for the kids and the food is good they have real good pizza there um-hum	3222	A
uh-huh right have it at home yeah	3222	A
yeah i know i don't like Domino's either	3222	A
yeah yeah well i've just never cared for for their pizza at all we have a Little Caesar's down here	3222	A
yeah yeah it's really good and very um you get a good quality for the money you pay	3222	A
so	3222	A
yeah	3222	A
yeah	3222	A
yeah	3222	A
uh-huh	3222	A
oh you do	3222	A
is it northeast- northeast or	3222	A
oh okay yeah that's really not that far from Garland just	3222	A
you like to eat we're we can even discuss restaurants	3222	B
um-hum	3222	B
um-hum	3222	B
uh-huh yeah	3222	B
hm	3222	B
where is it	3222	B
uh-huh	3222	B
uh-huh	3222	B
i know i've seen it somewhere	3222	B
what is it is it what's it like just good food	3222	B
um-hum	3222	B
value and taste	3222	B
i uh i am not a as much an Italian food fan except for garlic bread and i could eat my weight in garlic bread	3222	B
uh-huh	3222	B
um-hum	3222	B
i would love that i mean but uh you know that's what	3222	B
except for the type of food that's kind of what i like	3222	B
um my i Mexican restaurant	3222	B
and um and and i work uh downtown and so there are a lot around here um and and in	3222	B
oh you know like the Knox central you know On the Border i like for one kind of food and then there's the holes in the wall i like for another another type um	3222	B
and uh uh but what i look for is cost and yeah well i don't i don't know i don't like noisy restaurants either i that's why i don't go to On the Border that much	3222	B
yep and	3222	B
and	3222	B
i mean it's just i don't know it's a cavern you know it's just because_1 it's so big and tall and and a big room of full of lots of people or or what	3222	B
yes the all you can eat buffet my husband goes there for lunch and he just i mean he thinks it's uh Mexican food Mexican food you know it's	3222	B
really i've heard they're good	3222	B
um-hum	3222	B
oh yeah	3222	B
extras and oh	3222	B
so it's good yeah	3222	B
that's uh that's what i like cheap and then but i like- but do you like to go out or do you eat at McDonald's a lot or stuff like that	3222	B
or yeah	3222	B
right	3222	B
yeah	3222	B
no i don't but um	3222	B
so you've kind of got to go there for playing for the kids and not for you	3222	B
yeah	3222	B
oh	3222	B
yeah	3222	B
good pizza i love pizza but i usually order that pizza is what i usually order you know at the house deliver it to me	3222	B
and anything but Domino's	3222	B
i don't like their politics	3222	B
oh that's wonderful i've had their food before	3222	B
do you we get lots of coupons on our doors and and that's and i end up ordering from those like Spinners or Winnsers or you know the	3222	B
i don't know that we have any big one down where i live- i live in East Dallas so it's uh	3222	B
over by White Rock Lake	3222	B
and	3222	B
and afternoon- good afternoon to you	3281	B
um no i do most of my cooking at home and um i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party	3281	B
um	3281	B
uh right i'm in Dallas of course um dinner parties down here probably	3281	B
oh turn out to be more things like barbecues and	3281	B
uh-huh yes yeah uh Tex-Mex- Tex-Mex uh Mexican food um	3281	B
probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
right	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
fried chicken	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
oh yes i have	3281	B
uh-huh	3281	B
right	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
right	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
improve upon that let's see	3281	B
i'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in	3281	B
and some yeah	3281	B
uh green beans and um carrots and things like that	3281	B
my green beans um i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them_1 in water and steam them_1 for about ten minutes	3281	B
and i like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them_1	3281	B
uh-huh	3281	B
right uh-huh um i like to just put	3281	B
a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there and it makes them_1 pretty tasty	3281	B
the Chinese type are they the real	3281	B
no i haven't ever used that	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
a white powder	3281	B
um	3281	B
gosh	3281	B
that's okay	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
yeah	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
yeah i might try that	3281	B
oh yes i love Chinese	3281	B
North African	3281	B
uh-huh	3281	B
um-hum	3281	B
hm	3281	B
uh-huh	3281	B
well i've enjoyed talking with you	3281	B
oh yes	3281	B
okay thank you bye-bye	3281	B
okay Diane and a very good afternoon to you	3281	A
do you uh do most of your cooking at home or do you uh have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them	3281	A
ah my goodness well what would you uh like to cook what's what what what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner party now- you're in Dallas is it	3281	A
okay	3281	A
i was i was thinking in terms of Mexican almost Tex-Mex- Tex-Mex	3281	A
um-hum	3281	A
well that's a very interesting food though and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods i like to find we have uh	3281	A
i think Chico's or or these different restaurants in this area that uh have all those fine Mexican foods but um if i were to cook uh a dinner party	3281	A
uh it may be standard to you but uh actually i never get too much fried chicken	3281	A
but i would have fried chicken um with reasonably hot sauce on it almost a Mexican type thing	3281	A
and i love twice cooked potatoes have you ever had twice cooked potatoes	3281	A
with with the cream made of the the sour cream and cream cheese and uh little oleo and i use uh	3281	A
oregano and maybe dill weed on mixed in with it	3281	A
and uh i like broccoli casseroles	3281	A
and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too	3281	A
so uh how would you improve upon that	3281	A
more fresh vegetables included to that	3281	A
uh-huh	3281	A
how do you cook your green beans	3281	A
um-hum	3281	A
so you	3281	A
all -right that's what i was wondering about what what you use and and and herbs and so forth	3281	A
um-hum	3281	A
have you ever tried Chinese type green beans	3281	A
we use soy sauce	3281	A
well you might uh be interested in that have it gives a very delicious taste you you have a soy sauce taste and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the water and um	3281	A
golly what's this white powder that that uh	3281	A
that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce and i can't even think of the name of that right at the moment	3281	A
anyhow sorry about my mind but uh it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans and then you have the nice soy sauce taste under it	3281	A
with a few onions in there with it it does it it brings out such a so much different things in uh in the string beans	3281	A
i like- i like it to try them_1 differently i hardly ever cook them the same way twice	3281	A
just so i can enjoy them_1	3281	A
so you might uh think about that Chinese-	3281	A
Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them	3281	A
and uh north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous	3281	A
and that's uh made from uh semolina i think they call it beans	3281	A
and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous	3281	A
uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it with it makes a very delicious dish you probably- probably have to buy that from specialty stores	3281	A
C O U S C O U S and that's a a north African dish they eat it one to two meals every day in North Africa	3281	A
and it is very very flexible you can do a lot of things with it makes a fantastic uh	3281	A
uh salad	3281	A
with cucumbers and olive oil and onions and oh boy real tasty	3281	A
well i've enjoyed talking with you and i hope i've given you some ideas and uh	3281	A
that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food	3281	A
well thank you very much Miss Diane	3281	A
bye-bye	3281	A
um well about nursing homes and and older people uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother	3204	A
and they're just really close here and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and i um help with her and bathe her and feed her	3204	A
and um and i- i it's hard to be a caretaker i really believe it's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty four hours a day	3204	A
uh it she has Alzheimer's and does not remember	3204	A
uh a lot if anything and so she asks the same questions over and over again	3204	A
which is not unrealistic- you know unrealistic um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them_1 again or just answer another question	3204	A
uh i- i some nights his mother calls me and says can your family and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented	3204	A
she's ninety two	3204	A
oh well i think that's wonderful	3204	A
well	3204	A
um-hum	3204	A
yeah i was just gonna say	3204	A
yeah um	3204	A
yes uh i think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can and reside there like little apartment places in between places	3204	A
and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves um	3204	A
yeah yeah	3204	A
yeah	3204	A
um-hum	3204	A
yeah	3204	A
nursing homes	3204	A
visit	3204	A
uh-huh	3204	A
they don't go and see them that's right that's right	3204	A
you know um i- i think nursing homes are	3204	A
our um some are good i have to say that but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children	3204	A
um	3204	A
right right	3204	A
um-hum i hope so you know it's i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice	3204	A
to have them go there and then if you find out that they are not having good care you know i'm sure that it is just you know you'd pull them_1 out of there so fast	3204	A
and uh and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't it's a very very hard decision i think	3204	A
um-hum	3204	A
i think that's right and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment	3204	A
now i know a friend of mine who had a father um she brought to her home	3204	A
um to live there but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out	3204	A
and that might be a partial solution or something but um	3204	A
i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever	3204	A
yeah	3204	A
yeah	3204	A
well i- i think we kind of are along the same lines	3204	A
good to hear from you have a lovely day	3204	A
what is it about nursing homes	3204	B
yeah	3204	B
um-hum	3204	B
right	3204	B
oh it's very difficult i know	3204	B
um-hum um-hum	3204	B
right	3204	B
yeah	3204	B
yeah how old is she	3204	B
uh my see my father is ninety two and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and	3204	B
and do the whole thing but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then	3204	B
i don't know what i'll do up there i- i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so	3204	B
they're in Missouri and i could i- i know i know stories for sure that they just they they just well they can't take the proper care of them_1 most of them	3204	B
and uh it's it's tragic that you know when people live so long that they uh	3204	B
don't have a place- really don't have a place to go	3204	B
so	3204	B
right	3204	B
yeah there's one very close to where my parents are but uh	3204	B
i think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't wanna spend the money on anything so uh i mean he's from that old depression era and uh you know it's oh it's just blissful that they're both able to do everything for themselves	3204	B
i would imagine that i'll uh if something happens i'll move one of them or both- you know in in with me	3204	B
so uh but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and but i think you'd have to really they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the uh	3204	B
on this this- homes but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a i think you just have to drop in all uh unexpectedly a lot	3204	B
and so many people when they put people in a nurses home they never see them	3204	B
they never go to see them i've talked to many uh	3204	B
owners of places and say that nobody even- maybe maybe Christmas	3204	B
um-hum right	3204	B
oh i do too	3204	B
or if if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so	3204	B
uh because_1 i know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes- homes uh	3204	B
regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved	3204	B
so anyway	3204	B
right	3204	B
oh it's tough i'm sure	3204	B
oh	3204	B
right it'd be devastating i'm sure so	3204	B
it is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought and prior probably	3204	B
yeah	3204	B
right	3204	B
um-hum	3204	B
right	3204	B
i would hope we could do that and then go from there	3204	B
well anyway	3204	B
we've covered a little bit and uh it's good to hear from you and	3204	B
have a good have a good life-	3204	B
yeah	3248	B
yeah i remember it it's just like what do i know about the metric system	3248	B
okay	3248	B
right	3248	B
i know the whole world has managed to be doing metric system and we're just kind of left out in the middle of nothing and then having to do the conversions that uh the rest of the world doesn't have to do	3248	B
which makes it more difficult in trading and and that type of thing	3248	B
as far as going back and forth between the two	3248	B
yeah the schools need to do more widespread um you touch it a little here and there and but you're never explained- really explained to it all and	3248	B
and actually even in the science classes though a lot of times um the metric system is used rather than	3248	B
um	3248	B
the American system	3248	B
that we use	3248	B
um-hum	3248	B
um-hum	3248	B
um-hum	3248	B
i think the most logical way is just to educate very severely or very uh	3248	B
try very hard in the education system and starting with the young eventually- eventually they grow old and they take a while to do it that way but um since it's just right now touched on the education system the more that it's used	3248	B
um and it's impressed upon the children the more comfortable they'll feel with it um i don't feel very comfortable with the metric system even though i was exposed to it	3248	B
um but if they did even- so even more than they are now eventually um	3248	B
it would gain popularity as they grow older and um they could switch over more easily the more people they have that's trained on the metric system rather than our system	3248	B
right	3248	B
exactly	3248	B
um-hum	3248	B
right but much easier so and i always had a hard time converting- -converting it's like why can't we just all do it the same what's the purpose of switching back and forth why are we different	3248	B
oh okay well i am sorry to do this to you um i don't know if you explained this is part of a fund raiser for the church	3248	A
yeah well i don't know anything so um you know we can just kind of wing it but if you're ready i'll push one and we can start and-	3248	A
lately their bank has been so full that they've been cutting us off after about_1 three to five minutes so it it won't be anything like the	3248	A
okay	3248	A
i don't know why the last effort failed i- i know that it's very hard to get people to change	3248	A
to do different things i think the metric system is so convenient because it's in multiples of ten um but it's just hard	3248	A
to switch everything over England managed to do it uh	3248	A
uh	3248	A
um-hum	3248	A
i don't know if they um tried before if there were any way that they could offer incentives to corporations that switched uh	3248	A
i don't even really know where to they would begin i mean certainly um it's already being taught in the schools	3248	A
um-hum well it well it is a a an universal system now uh	3248	A
i uh	3248	A
and some ways it's like the idea of the alternative school calendar uh the way our calendar set up	3248	A
goes back to uh the days when we were primarily an agricultural country and people- they needed the kids home to help with the farming and planting and um	3248	A
again the rest of the world	3248	A
it has- it has already adopted has always had a uh what we call an alternative calendar with more breaks throughout the year and a shorter summer vacation uh	3248	A
and and gradually as things try and uh and	3248	A
using that as a parallel i know different districts are trying first with you know one or two schools and and then some districts have converted uh	3248	A
maybe there's some areas that they could start a conversion like maybe at the gas pumps you know that would be one way maybe they need to do it in stages	3248	A
uh	3248	A
um-hum	3248	A
um and actually the metric system itself isn't so difficult it's the conversion that's difficult and um	3248	A
that's what um i look at it from uh	3248	A
trying to feed families from old recipes and things having um i- i have friends in England and Germany and when they give me recipes it's hard because they do things in grams and um you know their whole measuring system is different and	3248	A
um	3248	A
i think that's been an area of resistance but i think your idea of uh	3248	A
starting through the schools and working with the kids um certainly easier growing up with it it's easier to learn something when you are young than to relearn and uh	3248	A
yeah	3248	A
well i don't know why the effort failed before but i have a feeling that it may have been businesses it would be costly for them to convert over um especially some of the	3248	A
manufacturing industries all the machines they have um to have to convert over to centimeters um although several things uh	3248	A
already are i know my husband has tools for the car that he has to use	3248	A
well do you have any pets	3239	A
oh	3239	A
oh i used to have box turtles um well years ago when i was growing up i	3239	A
i really liked them um	3239	A
oh	3239	A
yes um we have one dog a Bichon Frise um	3239	A
our friends in Houston bred the dogs i had never heard of them	3239	A
they're um they're all white and they're small and um and fluffy they don't shed i guess they are distantly related to a poodle but	3239	A
they're not very well known in this country and they're not um high strung or over bred	3239	A
um	3239	A
ours is uh on the small end and she's about ten pounds and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds	3239	A
and they love people um	3239	A
and kids and that was something we were looking for um	3239	A
our our love is Golden Retrievers and	3239	A
that's what we had intended to get in Houston but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate	3239	A
so uh we ended up getting this and uh my son would rather have a Golden Retriever though i think now he wants a	3239	A
a good size dog	3239	A
oh	3239	A
yeah	3239	A
what they really are um they're really sweet dogs we've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um	3239	A
the family that had them and and bred them they had five litters of puppies and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because um	3239	A
they	3239	A
it's B I C H O N F R I S E	3239	A
Bichon Frise	3239	A
yeah they're uh	3239	A
and they don't shed so they're they're good dogs for people with with allergies and they love people i mean they're	3239	A
um no not really ours um	3239	A
ours barks more than uh than	3239	A
some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house we used to swap back and forth dogs that they have three dogs they had a Cockapoo and and two Bichons um	3239	A
and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there and and um	3239	A
now it's funny she's she's a good watch dog i mean if there's	3239	A
um she'll bark that way but she also talk a lot she	3239	A
um	3239	A
has a definite personality and so if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left um	3239	A
no no and they're um they're very smart dogs the circuses in Europe used to use them um for the acts they uh	3239	A
oh they'll dance on their hind legs each	3239	A
um but they're very easy to train and	3239	A
well they range i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars i think which i thought was a lot	3239	A
well she's no longer breeding them but um because her dogs um	3239	A
the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem	3239	A
and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know they weren't weren't show quality	3239	A
right-	3239	A
oh but yeah it takes a lot of time um	3239	A
yeah um but she might have some contacts here i know originally- i know that	3239	A
the dog's grandmother um	3239	A
was from Plano	3239	A
oh that's where i live too	3239	A
yes i do i have a dog named Grisly who's a ten year old uh mixed breed between Golden Retriever Afghan Hound and Chow and i have a pair of box turtles	3239	B
yeah	3239	B
oh yeah i do too	3239	B
Lucky and Spot that's their names and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle and always has his nose all around my turtle box	3239	B
so do you have any pets now	3239	B
no i haven't either	3239	B
oh and how big do they get	3239	B
oh that's interesting	3239	B
yes- the water yes	3239	B
yeah	3239	B
oh	3239	B
uh-huh well we've got a good size dog and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog	3239	B
for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature Dachshund and i miss having a little one	3239	B
you know around the kind you have sounds very interesting though	3239	B
oh	3239	B
uh-huh	3239	B
and how do you spell that breed	3239	B
F R I S E and how do you pronounce that	3239	B
okay	3239	B
i'm writing it out phonetically	3239	B
yes	3239	B
do they bark a lot	3239	B
uh-huh	3239	B
oh	3239	B
uh-huh	3239	B
yes	3239	B
oh	3239	B
does she ever mess in the house	3239	B
oh	3239	B
uh-huh	3239	B
oh gee	3239	B
uh-huh	3239	B
and about how much are they	3239	B
and how about the and how about the person in uh Houston	3239	B
oh	3239	B
uh-huh	3239	B
oh yes	3239	B
just pets	3239	B
yes that's what we'd rather have is just a pet instead of we used to show Saint Bernards when i was a little girl we did that every weekend	3239	B
yes and it's very expensive	3239	B
oh that's where i live	3239	B
yeah i'm at Coit and Legacy-	3239	B
real excited when i heard this that's why i've been trying to call all day because i keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so football i love this this is great well we're from Colorado so we're Bronco fans	3269	A
and um we just moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again that was pretty pitiful but they seem to be doing pretty good this year	3269	A
oh	3269	A
yeah	3269	A
well they haven't they haven't have they just lost one game this year	3269	A
two	3269	A
yeah but they're not doing bad people are pretty surprised that they i mean they beat the Giants	3269	A
i bet oh boy i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it	3269	A
yep	3269	A
yeah	3269	A
yeah well i am i'm a big football fan i never was- my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and i just hated it and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays	3269	A
and uh so when i met my husband he was watching football and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend i couldn't see him until like Tuesday because Monday Night Football if i didn't like football so	3269	A
yep	3269	A
um-hum um-hum	3269	A
yeah	3269	A
uh-huh well i do i just i love it it's such i just think it's such a fun sport and uh i'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet we're not convinced that we're gonna be Cowboy fans yet	3269	A
but uh well i guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here that's even harder but	3269	A
um-hum	3269	A
no we're just this is only the second place we've lived we've only been married for five and a half years and uh we have two small children and he had a uh just got transferred here to E Systems	3269	A
oh	3269	A
oh	3269	A
well i tell you this the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know and when you go to a football game in Colorado it's	3269	A
you know there's snow and it's an adventure and here you know you just got to drive down to the to the stadium and uh	3269	A
yes	3269	A
well he's from here	3269	A
so	3269	A
yeah that's what i hear	3269	A
which is rare	3269	A
which is good yeah but uh i you know it's funny in in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last i don't know five or six years whatever it's been um they have these songs on the radio they take modern- popular songs and and	3269	A
change them_1 to fit uh the Broncos and stuff and they had i was just thinking about one the other day uh if i saw a picture of John Elway in the cafeteria- in the cafeteria at school um but they did the Johnny Angel they did Johnny Elway to that	3269	A
and i'm uh i was trying to get my son to sing that my husband was just having a fit don't have him sing that song but they they do a lot of fun things i think football is football's kind of a a sport that i think you kind of it's hard not to like it it you know there's just	3269	A
it's exciting yeah	3269	A
yeah yeah they probably i i wish i would've bought the tape when i was in uh Texas- in Colorado because uh i- i think about that a lot but you know when i first moved here was when they well no i guess it was about a year ago they did this	3269	A
this interstate seventy five song or- or	3269	A
whatever it was about_1 Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety five and everything that was kind of a funny song but they sure do it- seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here even when they were losing pitifully	3269	A
you know people still support them_1 we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs we love the Cowboys-	3269	A
oh yes	3269	B
well i was from Illinois originally and i grew up a Bear fan	3269	B
and uh then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans	3269	B
and we had some wonderful wonderful years there under Roger Staubach	3269	B
we kind of got spoiled	3269	B
we expected it to continue forever i think they're doing pretty well this year though	3269	B
i think two i know they lost yeah to Washington and Philadelphia	3269	B
yeah and wasn't that fun i went- went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me and i must say i attracted a lot of attention people running up saying oh what's the score what's the score	3269	B
that's right and that's exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television	3269	B
and now then i wasn't i had forgotten or i probably wouldn't have been there	3269	B
yeah	3269	B
that's exactly where both of the wives came from i think it was uh you know it's easier to join them_1 than fight them_1	3269	B
and if you wanna see them you might just as well enjoy football and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh you know did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games	3269	B
well it takes a little brainwashing first	3269	B
yeah are you uh transit usually i mean do you stay not in one place too long	3269	B
well it'll take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver	3269	B
oh i know	3269	B
well if they close it in see we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about_1 doing but uh Dan Reeves a pretty neat guy anyway	3269	B
yeah that's right you know he was one of ours one of our boys so we are never we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys	3269	B
yep	3269	B
um-hum	3269	B
Johnny Elway	3269	B
well there's so much about it to like you know it's so exciting and when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here course they put together some real cute songs and we all ran out and bought the records and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item	3269	B
um-hum	3269	B
just recently i was kind of laughing when i when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh i had to have my uh radiator flushed	3288	B
and it was getting rusty and the thing that they forgot to do was to um to also look at the hose	3288	B
and i had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst so i was stranded out on the highway	3288	B
no i i i didn't do that thank goodness but um there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were gonna they had repaired it t	3288	B
so that was that was a horrible experience just recently	3288	B
yes yes i know i know what about you	3288	B
uh-huh	3288	B
oh	3288	B
um-hum	3288	B
uh-huh	3288	B
uh-huh	3288	B
oh oh i know i know especially what if you're out on the highway	3288	B
um-hum um-hum i know well you know i uh living in Dallas you know we've got uh bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and uh that was that was horrible	3288	B
but my car is getting old see it's about six years old now so	3288	B
yeah so i got it right out of college and so it's uh it's starting to show that wear and tear now	3288	B
uh-huh uh-huh yeah that uh that was my graduation present to myself so yeah yeah i know so but gosh it's really starting to to wear so i've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car	3288	B
gonna because_1 i can't uh i don't know if i wanna you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown	3288	B
um-hum um-hum yeah that's true i agree with you there so i don't know uh because_1 i i need to have it tuned you know tuned up and i don't know replace some of the belts and i was looking at the uh	3288	B
tires need to be replaced and so i was thinking gee that's a lot of money i'm might as well buy me a new car for that	3288	B
uh-huh well you have to Pennsylvania boy you have to really have your car winterized and stuff huh	3288	B
um-hum	3288	B
oh really oh okay so	3288	B
uh-huh well especially don't you have what a lot of salt on the ground	3288	B
uh-huh	3288	B
yeah yeah well rust and the and the body too huh	3288	B
uh-huh	3288	B
well i think they got the new Z Bart stuff and everything to where you can um	3288	B
uh-huh yeah and go like that so	3288	B
do you	3288	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3288	B
well i i think i'm getting too old for all that my uh i had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff so i can i can do all that stuff but i i think i'd much prefer to pay the twenty two ninety five to to go and have it done now so i can get my hands dirty	3288	B
so yeah i'm just getting getting to that age i guess you just don't have your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things i wanna spend my time on anymore	3288	B
absolutely absolutely so yeah trying to you know i just need one i had two cars there for a while so i wouldn't have to worry about which car was gonna run	3288	B
and yeah so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them_1 and yeah so that	3288	B
yes one was bad enough but i think i got rid of the wrong one i soon i need a lot of repairs done on on this one so yeah that was uh that was something else	3288	B
whenever our five minutes up i i didn't i didn't set the time or anything to uh yeah put	3288	B
well yeah i guess um you know unless you're um you know big {do-it-yourselfer} um to you know fix up your own cars and	3288	B
and things like that so but i guess they- they were talking about experiences you know i uh uh i did my parents live in Ohio so i i do know something about_1 the you know the really cold weather	3288	B
and uh i've always lived down here in the South and i went- i took my car up there to their house and um i guess i had a crack in the block and when i got up there the car	3288	B
hi so uh what was the last car repair you had	3288	A
oh	3288	A
oh no did you crack the block or what	3288	A
yeah i'll see you got lucky didn't ruin the whole engine though that can be pretty serious	3288	A
oh i guess it's been awhile for me i'd say- it's been about a year	3288	A
yeah i had the uh the water pump break on my car	3288	A
yeah i was traveling uh i was going on my way home from Thanksgiving and it broke like in the middle of nowhere	3288	A
so i had to get it towed and then fixed and big pain	3288	A
yeah that's where i was luckily someone came by and gave me a ride	3288	A
yeah	3288	A
yeah so is mine	3288	A
yeah i'm hoping mine gets me through i got until May till i'm out so if my car lasts that long i'll be okay	3288	A
oh that's nice	3288	A
yeah	3288	A
yeah i don't wanna do too much on mine because_1 it'll be worth more than the car and that it it's not worth it	3288	A
yeah	3288	A
yeah i got new tires last winter too so i'm like that's the last major purchase for this thing it's not worth it	3288	A
yeah yeah we get some killer winters up here in the mountains	3288	A
yeah lot of snow and a lot of cold	3288	A
yeah at times there's a lot of it you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance	3288	A
yeah i haven't had a big problem with that though	3288	A
so i've been pretty lucky there	3288	A
yeah that's for usually pretty good you just rinse it off after the winter's over and done with it	3288	A
yeah i usually like to do most repairs on my own though	3288	A
yeah just because_1 that way i know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't	3288	A
yeah plus if something goes wrong i'll know who to blame	3288	A
more fun things to do	3288	A
well that's nice	3288	A
yeah	3288	A
one's bad enough	3288	A
yeah i was just wondering that	3288	A
yeah i didn't either	3288	A
yeah this must be a a hard category	3288	A
-okay changes what- how how old are you	3263	B
twenty oh boy i'm thirty three i feel a lot older uh what do you think the changes are	3263	B
acceptable as in um	3263	B
yeah	3263	B
i work for a really big corporation and we are uh NCNB	3263	B
yeah and we've got a lot of women in the in the company and i'm a lawyer too so it's like this- you know i i've got a i perspective working for a big corporation and a professional working for a big corporation	3263	B
and uh	3263	B
i i you know there are a lot of women here there are a lot of women in power positions but uh	3263	B
and and that's just all wonderful and hunky-dory and aren't we progressive business but there are very very few women in uh in senior positions	3263	B
on on not you know not on the board of directors uh you know not in senior level management and i don't know if that's from um i don't know that's	3263	B
uh just because there hasn't been time or whether there's a glass- you know what they call a glass ceiling	3263	B
i i think it's i think what you're saying is true and that it's acceptable and okay women get out and work but i don't know that um they're they're really expected- they're really then um	3263	B
in i hate to use the word again accepted in the position of being workers	3263	B
you know yeah y'all get out there and do that but you know we're not gonna you know we're not gonna make a chairman of the board	3263	B
just just because_1 i don't see it i also i work with a lot of law firms and a lot of companies and you know most of the most of the uh movers and shakers are men	3263	B
and then in the bank even most of the you know there are a few women that really stand out but you know most of the young eager ones you know the oh the young wonder children are men	3263	B
no no uh well i don't know i think maybe some of it's because uh uh	3263	B
i don't no and- i'm i'm not certain i don't know	3263	B
seems like some of the women they maybe the women aren't motivated uh	3263	B
but	3263	B
right i'm gonna go in and be a clerk	3263	B
and no you're just as smart as the fellow you're working for	3263	B
that's what i see a lot of	3263	B
i wrote my senior research paper on the Equal Rights Amendment so i'm kind of an activist yes yeah	3263	B
i'm very liberal and i speaking to someone in Provo Utah	3263	B
how many men are there in in in you know the nursing profession	3263	B
yeah	3263	B
and and why is that	3263	B
yeah i know but	3263	B
i did- exactly	3263	B
well	3263	B
and uh you know i my sister-in-law's a nurse i know what she does and it's she has a lot of responsibility i mean she just doesn't change bedpans and uh	3263	B
yeah	3263	B
exactly they get the bucks and they get the and the recognition for it and all the patient sees is this woman you know hovering around yeah and you know yanking on wires and and IV cords and	3263	B
so i i and i don't think that i don't think that nurses get half the recognition they ought to for example	3263	B
so	3263	B
i am twenty	3263	A
yeah how old are you	3263	A
oh	3263	A
um	3263	A
hm um i just think it's more acceptable for women to um be in the workplace than uh i guess it was a long time ago um	3263	A
that's	3263	A
like	3263	A
i just think that they were expected to be at home more before	3263	A
and now it's more	3263	A
prevalent i guess	3263	A
oh really	3263	A
um	3263	A
uh-huh	3263	A
right	3263	A
um-hum so you just don't think that it's as	3263	A
do you think that's good or bad or	3263	A
um-hum	3263	A
right	3263	A
and why do you think that- why why do you think that is just	3263	A
um-hum	3263	A
do you think it's because_1 they have the qualifications or because not at all	3263	A
oh	3263	A
hm	3263	A
they just are willing to take the backseat or	3263	A
um-hum	3263	A
oh really-	3263	A
are you really	3263	A
so you're pretty um liberal as far as	3263	A
well um yeah i i don't know i'm more of a	3263	A
i guess i'm more conservative in my viewpoints i mean i think it's great if they want it if you know women wanna do that and i'm planning on being a nurse so but	3263	A
i don't know i	3263	A
very few very few	3263	A
but	3263	A
because_1 they think it's a woman's job probably	3263	A
uh or maybe men wanna earn more money- i i don't	3263	A
want- wanna earn more money so they can support family- i don't	3263	A
hum	3263	A
right the you just don't think that it pays off i mean like i i found out like	3263	A
the all the doctor comes- comes in and does is the like end delivery is come in and deliver- deliver the baby i mean all the {pre-everything} is nurse nurses but the doctors get the bucks	3263	A
yeah	3263	A
um-hum	3263	A
oh definitely i i agree	3263	A
all right well i'm uh i'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling i'm afraid we um recently moved here from North Carolina and	3236	B
they had curbside recycling and it was very easy-	3236	B
put everything out there but we don't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now	3236	B
and uh so i've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where they belong	3236	B
well we've been here since January so we we still feel very new but i it's working up to a year now so i guess we're old-timers compared to some people	3236	B
uh	3236	B
yeah	3236	B
uh-huh	3236	B
uh-huh	3236	B
where do you take those things	3236	B
uh-huh	3236	B
where do you do that because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um but i didn't know where to take them	3236	B
oh	3236	B
yeah	3236	B
better than nothing right	3236	B
yeah i it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that you know it's coming in a couple of months but	3236	B
oh	3236	B
right	3236	B
yeah yeah it gets to be a bit much before- haul it off but	3236	B
well they do- yeah they they're a lot of bulk anyway and yeah	3236	B
right	3236	B
yeah it was real easy with the bins it really was and it was- it was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage so um i	3236	B
right	3236	B
yeah yeah	3236	B
well how much do you earn on the cans i- i didn't know how what kind of an idea to give her for	3236	B
uh-huh	3236	B
yeah	3236	B
so it's gone down yeah	3236	B
right yeah	3236	B
uh-huh	3236	B
yeah	3236	B
well that sounds like a pretty good project well	3236	B
oh well i'll i'll have to kick myself and and get- get on it my neighbor across the street um	3236	B
is so careful about recycling and so i	3236	B
keep telling myself i'll i'll get it organized but maybe- maybe they'll beat me and and do the city wide first and	3236	B
right right i don't have any excuse then that's for sure	3236	B
thinking about it anyway yeah but well um have you do they time this thing for us or do we	3236	B
you can't- you can't chat all day huh okay	3236	B
okay bye-bye	3236	B
why don't you go ahead and say what you feel and then i'll respond	3236	A
yeah	3236	A
well how long have you been here	3236	A
well	3236	A
yeah	3236	A
yeah i think that's a good excuse you need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things	3236	A
we've been here probably two and a half years and	3236	A
and we didn't recycle at all before we came so i think we're doing well we we've saved most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now	3236	A
well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to Wal-Mart	3236	A
they have um in behind Wal-Mart they have bins	3236	A
and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money	3236	A
um-hum	3236	A
um there's a place on Parker Road um it's just over the overpass before you get like to KMart i think there's a a service station there there's usually a semi truck	3236	A
that has a a person there that will weigh them_1 and	3236	A
now they aren't worth much right now but it's better than nothing so and	3236	A
what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now and we hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October	3236	A
yeah and i think it's been delayed i think it was originally scheduled for February but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with	3236	A
from what i've read in you know the mail that we get and i can't wait for that that will be easy i get tired of newspaper littering the garage	3236	A
i feel guilty we don't recycle our our milk containers because_1 they seem like a big waste	3236	A
yeah yeah they fill up the whole kitchen garbage pail so i'll be glad when the bins do come and i think that's when i'll i'll start doing the plastic too	3236	A
yeah	3236	A
i've gotten used to washing the you know the um salad dressing bottles and things like that it's not that big of a deal i mean it's nicer to just throw them_1 out but we can do our part take an extra minute or two	3236	A
oh when we first were were here it was like we'd take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full and it'd be like two dollars	3236	A
but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar	3236	A
yeah which is understandable i think more people are are recycling but that's something that- we we don't really make any effort to	3236	A
and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans and that was kind of fun but we haven't done that for a long time	3236	A
so	3236	A
um-hum	3236	A
well hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you on so all right well it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting so	3236	A
yeah trying that's all you can do so that	3236	A
um yeah you can do it as long as you want they you know if it's been long enough five minutes is is when they cut in and say	3236	A
say we don't have anymore room for recording so so we can say good-bye now it was good talking to you and maybe we'll get on line again thanks Sherry bye-bye	3236	A
uh how do you feel about this topic	3273	A
right	3273	A
right i understand completely you know i- i feel the same way	3273	A
you know i- i believe in drug testing	3273	A
you know there's nothing wrong with that because something like that if you work in some some types of some type of situations that makes it um	3273	A
makes you unmanageable or something like that that you could either hurt yourself or somebody else	3273	A
uh	3273	A
i might really agree with it you know if they tell you before you come into employment like when you're going to get hired	3273	A
you know i don't see anything wrong with them telling you that you might have to go through one and and then	3273	A
sometimes i have a hard time understanding the random	3273	A
you know the i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out	3273	A
and you go through the drug test	3273	A
what's that now	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
yeah that's true	3273	A
that's true	3273	A
were they	3273	A
right and who's to say if it's for sure	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
yeah where i	3273	A
yeah where i was hired they made us sign something saying that we could be um put through one at any time	3273	A
and we were like okay	3273	A
but we did have to sign that	3273	A
but um	3273	A
right	3273	A
right	3273	A
or air traffic controllers	3273	A
right or even somebody on a line you know that could run machinery or something like that	3273	A
yeah that's how i feel too	3273	A
i don't know have you been in Dallas a long time or	3273	A
about twelve years	3273	A
i just moved here and then South Dakota is very seldom	3273	A
that you see a drug test	3273	A
but	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
because i was really surprised because i- i go into my major is in accounting	3273	A
and i've looked at an accounting positions	3273	A
and definitely a a position i've applied for has either come up	3273	A
or you know they won't make you go through one	3273	A
which was a real surprise	3273	A
what's that	3273	A
no to get a position i just moved here in June	3273	A
and uh from South Dakota and i was real you know shocked to here how many that did	3273	A
you know from where i'm from it's not	3273	A
that popular or that much i think	3273	A
yes	3273	A
yeah you know like Dallas has got more people than the whole state of South Dakota	3273	A
yes that's very true	3273	A
and um you know i guess i never was awakened to it you know i knew it was out there but i knew you know i didn't know it was to a an extent	3273	A
and uh i'm glad it's there you know but um	3273	A
it was just something that i come across that i wasn't really you know used to	3273	A
but you know i- i feel fine with it you know that's not a problem	3273	A
and uh	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
can high- can a high school do that	3273	A
can a high school do that	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
yeah i've never heard of a high school asking a student to do that i guess	3273	A
huh that is that in Dallas or	3273	A
that's in Dallas	3273	A
yeah	3273	A
uh-huh	3273	A
oh really	3273	A
huh	3273	A
oh you do teach	3273	A
oh really	3273	A
um	3273	A
my brother is the Admissions Director at UTD	3273	A
the Admissions Director for UTD	3273	A
so i kind of know something about Richardson but	3273	A
yeah	3273	A
um i think it's just fine but um i just worry about some things that show up as drugs that aren't like i've heard poppy seeds come up to be like opium i think they're in the same family	3273	B
and just little things like that that um	3273	B
you might get in big trouble for and just because you ate a roll with poppy seeds on it you know	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um	3273	B
well random	3273	B
random i heard was to make it fair so they wouldn't think you're just picking on somebody	3273	B
i've just heard that the random testing like drawing a name out of a hat or whatever is just so they can't be accused of you know picking on someone in particular that they're suspicious about you know	3273	B
but um because_1 i work at a school and they were thinking about doing that	3273	B
yeah but even though they were i mean who's to say it's random or not you know	3273	B
they could just	3273	B
uh-huh they could be saying it's random and they could be not random	3273	B
so	3273	B
you can't prove- prove that	3273	B
huh	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
well i just worry uh you know i don't care so much about well i mean they can- they'll get fired whether they do their job or not you know if the drugs affect their job that much but	3273	B
um i just worry about people that have jobs that could hurt other people like bus drivers and	3273	B
stuff like that	3273	B
yeah exactly or pilots or	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum about twelve years	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
i think like	3273	B
if you work in defense like i know people have had to have drug tests for that and	3273	B
but then they have like a secret clearance	3273	B
but um then i know people that work at um	3273	B
you know normal companies and	3273	B
some do and some don't require drug testing you know if it affected the work they might you know wonder but	3273	B
it's not required	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
hum even to change position	3273	B
to change positions	3273	B
oh	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
hum so a lot more here i guess because it's a big big city or	3273	B
and we're closer to Mexico	3273	B
uh-huh	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum me neither	3273	B
but i'm there's some people that i think there's a cheerleader that's suing a school for wanting to drug test her and i haven't heard if she's going to win or not but um like a high school	3273	B
but because	3273	B
hum	3273	B
um i think because it she's in the extracurricular thing cheerleading	3273	B
they they said they could but um i think she's going to try and use like the constitution against them	3273	B
saying it's an invasion of her privacy or something like that and and i don't know she might win i'm not sure i haven't heard	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
oh the high school that she's from	3273	B
um no i think it's out further west maybe California or something um-hum	3273	B
i thought see i teach so i thought you meant where i teach	3273	B
uh-huh in Richardson- in	3273	B
Richardson	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
he's the what	3273	B
oh	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
um-hum	3273	B
how neat so he's um decides if the students	3273	B
okay i'm ready	3245	B
uh-huh	3245	B
no i work at home	3245	B
do you have children	3245	B
oh that's good	3245	B
i have four girls they're nine and five and three and a newborn	3245	B
yes	3245	B
girls are nice aren't they	3245	B
anyway as far as clothing goes um	3245	B
my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size we go from regular kind of spring clothes	3245	B
regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes	3245	B
clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet	3245	B
or you're on your way up from regular size and they're all in boxes or bags and they all rotate all the time	3245	B
kind of the same stuff all the time though i don't uh get a whole lot new right now	3245	B
yeah	3245	B
yeah i- i like jeans a lot	3245	B
oh and it's it's frustrating i just i find i have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable	3245	B
they it it works best if they have pleats in the front	3245	B
and uh they have to my waist is kind of small compared to the hips so it has to be not the straight up and down Levi's kind	3245	B
but um but i when i was i was pregnant through the summer this time and i wore dresses all the time because_1 it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist	3245	B
but um	3245	B
yeah yeah	3245	B
uh-huh	3245	B
yeah yeah	3245	B
oh i haven't tried those	3245	B
huh	3245	B
yeah	3245	B
yeah	3245	B
uh-huh	3245	B
i don't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here but i sure never wear them	3245	B
yeah	3245	B
uh-huh	3245	B
<b_aside> i'm watching Janice <e_aside> uh-huh	3245	B
oh	3245	B
i- i remember that from when i was i worked way before i was	3245	B
married even but uh offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable	3245	B
you've got to have something to add to it or something i don't know if you can	3245	B
you burn up yeah	3245	B
yeah	3245	B
it's hard on the car	3245	B
oh	3245	B
yeah	3245	B
oh that's funny	3245	B
yeah	3245	B
at least something cooler	3245	B
that's true	3245	B
yeah i don't have to worry a whole lot about that	3245	B
that's right something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on too	3245	B
i've always been a creature of comfort too if it's not comfortable forget it	3245	B
wool was never comfortable to me	3245	B
okay so we're going to talk about uh what kind of clothes we wear while we work	3245	A
do you work for TI	3245	A
oh you do well you're like me then i stay home also	3245	A
yes i have two a seven year old and three and a half year old	3245	A
how about_1 you	3245	A
oh	3245	A
oh my you are busy	3245	A
and they're all girls i have two girls so all girls around here yes uh really sweet	3245	A
that's how i am too	3245	A
um-hum	3245	A
uh-huh	3245	A
uh-huh	3245	A
oh that's funny	3245	A
yeah	3245	A
yeah	3245	A
yeah i know that's kind of how i am	3245	A
i said who ever i talk to is going to be bored because when it's summer time i'm wearing shorts and when it's cold i'm wearing sweat pants and	3245	A
most of unless i'm going to something special that my daughter's doing or something like that i	3245	A
well that's that's good i used to wear jeans all the time until after i had kids and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places so	3245	A
yeah	3245	A
right yeah	3245	A
yeah yeah i know what you mean well	3245	A
oh	3245	A
uh-huh	3245	A
right	3245	A
uh-huh	3245	A
that's right	3245	A
one of my daughters was born in June	3245	A
and i remember i wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time	3245	A
and i had one that was born in December	3245	A
so um it was a little bit because- however it was a real warm winter so even even into like November and December i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses course i'm always hot when i'm pregnant too so i didn't really need warm clothes	3245	A
but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new uh units outfits you know that are just knit	3245	A
oh they're so comfortable it's it's just um you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff and	3245	A
it's just great because you can put you know you can decorate them_1 up or dress them_1 up if you want or you can just wear them_1 with you know tennis shoes if you want so they're really nice and i've enjoyed wearing those	3245	A
but i	3245	A
yeah well i don't either if we if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference	3245	A
i worked part time when my oldest was a baby	3245	A
and um i had to wear a dress every day and	3245	A
and uh it was a little bit hard to uh	3245	A
wind down i would i would have to drive six thirty five home and i would be burning up like in the summer time by the time i got home i was like oh i got to get out of these clothes	3245	A
uh-huh	3245	A
uh-huh	3245	A
right right	3245	A
yeah	3245	A
yeah	3245	A
yeah and then when you drive home like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in Dallas uh-huh because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time i was afraid i'd make the car overheat	3245	A
yeah so i would roll my windows down it was still a hundred degrees and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my daughter up and	3245	A
um i had a friend who used to take shorts to work and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes and i thought that's probably a good idea	3245	A
because_1 you really it-	3245	A
yeah because_1 you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them_1 if you	3245	A
especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any of	3245	A
no when you have children you don't um even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when i'm through	3245	A
that's right or if you get it dirty or whatever i know it	3245	A
me too	3245	A
i know that's how i am too	3245	A
right me neither i have	3245	A
oh	3234	B
well it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society	3234	B
oh my	3234	B
oh	3234	B
uh-huh	3234	B
well my children are the ones that wanted our pet and this one is probably the best one that we have had	3234	B
um as i say we got it from the Humane Society and uh we had lost a pet and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost it got out under the fence while we were on vacation and	3234	B
we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it but uh when we walked in to the	3234	B
to the Humane Society this little dog was uh in the office and would sit up and beg and just oh he was so cute and the kids just fell in love with it we just couldn't leave without it	3234	B
but it's um whoever had it before must have trained it real well	3234	B
because it's just you know it's uh a good house dog	3234	B
i've never had one that i could keep in the house before and tolerate it	3234	B
uh-huh	3234	B
um-hum	3234	B
it's hard to do that when you're not there constantly	3234	B
hm	3234	B
oh	3234	B
hm	3234	B
oh	3234	B
about the only time we have well i shouldn't say the only time but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night	3234	B
and uh she usually stays inside at night we try to take her out right before we go to sleep	3234	B
but uh sometimes it doesn't work	3234	B
um-hum	3234	B
oh	3234	B
what a cute idea	3234	B
well we got one one year for Christmas and uh i had a baby the next day	3234	B
and uh	3234	B
so that one wasn't really well trained	3234	B
oh i just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time so	3234	B
yeah i think- it was it really was The older kids had wanted one though and you know we thought well that would be a fun time for them to have it you know get it at Christmas time it was a little Spitz with- a little white	3234	B
fluffy and you know looked like it came right from the North Pole	3234	B
and that was fun but um i I sure wasn't good at training it	3234	B
i think you have to have time you know to to do those things	3234	B
that's right	3234	B
Carolyn i have a little Schnauzer little miniature Schnauzer	3234	A
what do you have	3234	A
uh you know those make the best animals uh pets- best pets	3234	A
my uh son has a uh oh it's a real mixture it's part uh	3234	A
Doberman and part Husky	3234	A
yes and they gentlest dog you ever met and they got him from the uh Humane Society here in Oklahoma City	3234	A
and she's just turned out to be a jewel	3234	A
my my little Schnauzer is is my friend she is so spoiled she's a year and a half old now	3234	A
and being single	3234	A
she's become very important in my life	3234	A
it's so nice to have come home and find something or someone who's really so happy to see you	3234	A
sometimes i wish i had not gotten this one as a puppy	3234	A
because i work and i'm not home	3234	A
and unfortunately she's not as well trained as	3234	A
as i would like her to be	3234	A
and i realize it's my fault i'm not	3234	A
doing a really great job as a disciplinarian	3234	A
but uh	3234	A
it is it is she's you know	3234	A
she's real good i can leave her all day in the bathroom	3234	A
with her toys and her food and everything and and not one mess does she make and then we go outside	3234	A
and she'll stay outside for oh thirty minutes to an hour	3234	A
come inside and use the restroom	3234	A
but she's a doll she's a love she really is	3234	A
you know i- i	3234	A
we always had a pet when i was growing up oh always had a dog my mother did not like cats	3234	A
so we always had a dog and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it's because_1	3234	A
the children wanted the pet	3234	A
and i find that i'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children's dog	3234	A
i uh in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for Christmas	3234	A
yeah i think so	3234	A
oh my goodness	3234	A
two babies huh	3234	A
oh	3234	A
that	3234	A
that is really probably	3234	A
bad timing	3234	A
oh yes	3234	A
uh-huh	3234	A
do you	3234	A
and patience and you have to	3234	A
you really have to be just like your children	3234	A
when you set a rule you have to stand by it	3234	A
and be consistent	3234	A
and	3234	A
well yes i do um i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that	3246	B
each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job	3246	B
do you do you have children in the public school system	3246	B
is that right	3246	B
you- you were a bookkeeper oh	3246	B
oh no well um i'm i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back and and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what you know i'd love	3246	B
to work with children and to teach them but i'm really having questions if if i can deal with that system and and have a good conscience about you know what i do i don't think	3246	B
i don't think it's the teachers i think it's the system but um	3246	B
right	3246	B
what child's gonna say something some parent's going to overreact to that's	3246	B
that's true well it's it's hard on the children too i think you know because the um the teachers are overworked and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best you know um and	3246	B
i have two i have uh in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade and them um i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year	3246	B
we um live in a district that has open classrooms and i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her	3246	B
yes you too	3246	B
oh	3246	B
still at it	3246	B
well the explanation i was was given about you know they they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take	3246	B
really that much money to at least come up with i mean some kind of partitions you know	3246	B
just yeah	3246	B
oh goodness	3246	B
oh	3246	B
were they	3246	B
well we were from North um Carolina and of course North North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education i think they rank about forty ninth but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program	3246	B
and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes	3246	B
and it was wonderful so you know i'm coming to to Plano thinking well gosh it's going to be really great it's ranked so much better	3246	B
isn't that interesting i- i- i don't understand how they get this this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money i don't know	3246	B
i guess so well my son is at Clark this year too so uh we're yes	3246	B
and uh he's pleased with his classes um i- i don't guess i've been in the high school long enough to to know	3246	B
what to expect really you know how to judge it uh	3246	B
well that's good	3246	B
yeah	3246	B
that's right	3246	B
do you see anything wrong with public school systems	3246	A
i agree	3246	A
yes and i taught for fourteen years	3246	A
before we moved to Texas and the the one thing i see is changing is	3246	A
i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children	3246	A
everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation	3246	A
yes	3246	A
me too	3246	A
i think so too	3246	A
they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores that children get on tests now	3246	A
and teacher competency you know and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder and	3246	A
that's right	3246	A
i know	3246	A
that's right	3246	A
do you have children in the system	3246	A
ah	3246	A
yep are you in Plano yep i am too and i have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year and he my ninth- my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews	3246	A
and the very first year i taught back in seventy three we had open classroom and it didn't work then and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here	3246	A
partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something	3246	A
i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area	3246	A
so i didn't really care for that it seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here	3246	A
that was our last tour up in Michigan	3246	A
oh	3246	A
um-hum	3246	A
oh wow	3246	A
yes	3246	A
yes that's right we heard wonderful things about it till we actually got in the system	3246	A
probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are	3246	A
so	3246	A
as a freshman yep	3246	A
yeah	3246	A
my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and i ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good so	3246	A
and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect	3246	A
for a freshman to have she's not bogged down but yet she has some every night	3246	A
yes you always hear how good now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home so i don't	3246	A
okay	3217	A
well uh it makes me realized how old i am that i can think of ten and twenty and even thirty years ago	3217	A
yes i do certainly remember	3217	A
yes	3217	A
yes sir	3217	A
i've i've been there uh	3217	A
i guess	3217	A
changes in	3217	A
communications and computer technology seem	3217	A
certainly	3217	A
or any of these periods	3217	A
um-hum	3217	A
uh how's it changed	3217	B
uh i can't go back that far	3217	B
well actually i can yeah thirty years ago was the Kennedy assassination	3217	B
quite relevant for being in Dallas	3217	B
yeah the-	3217	B
um	3217	B
i was just reading something recently about the uh Cuban missile crisis	3217	B
and uh and uh	3217	B
uh from what you know from then you know we had satellite pictures you know we can that's one	3217	B
um i don't really think we have anything	3201	B
in the works as of yet uh we're pretty small town and um the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart	3201	B
that show you know plastics	3201	B
paper	3201	B
liter bottles et cetera et cetera	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
um-hum	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
oh	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
huh	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
oh	3201	B
oh that'd be good	3201	B
yeah see it's not anywhere near that uh we uh you know as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans	3201	B
but that's as far as we go because_1 i take them_1 to a girl at work and she goes and cashes them in because you know i just	3201	B
i can do that for her and and i don't want the hassle because_1 we have to go to another town to do it	3201	B
yeah see we don't have anything here in Belton it's it's a pretty small little town	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
so	3201	B
yeah that's about all that- that we're doing here uh they're	3201	B
uh getting a little bit more on	3201	B
they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you can't because	3201	B
you know not a lot of people do really know what you know	3201	B
what it's for	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
um-hum	3201	B
wow that's excellent that's good	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
oh	3201	B
yeah they uh	3201	B
exactly	3201	B
yeah see ours just goes in the regular trash it just you know there's not a whole lot and there are you know some places that	3201	B
we'll set up you know for old newspapers and stuff but usually it's	3201	B
it it hasn't caught on yet i'm hoping it will soon	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
hm i wasn't totally aware of that	3201	B
so	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
yeah	3201	B
hm	3201	B
well	3201	B
i can't either because_1 we're we're at a very you know beginning stages so	3201	B
we look forward to it to get better but that's it	3201	B
yeah me too	3201	B
you too bye	3201	B
so do you have any recycling programs there	3201	A
uh-huh	3201	A
oh uh-huh	3201	A
yeah	3201	A
we've progressed a little bit farther than that um actually they have uh parts of town	3201	A
it may have even spread all over the whole town and um they have these green bins	3201	A
and it's just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump	3201	A
and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin and you put your bottles in it and paper	3201	A
and um you know all those things that aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin	3201	A
and uh i guess you can also- and a lot of the restaurants	3201	A
they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places	3201	A
where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles and uh	3201	A
oh i don't know i guess they're you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated	3201	A
and of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos	3201	A
uh and they have those strategically- strategically placed around the city	3201	A
and uh they're they're actually gonna extend it i think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and uh	3201	A
yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary	3201	A
oh yeah	3201	A
uh-huh	3201	A
yeah	3201	A
oh really hm	3201	A
yeah i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans and uh	3201	A
uh-huh	3201	A
yeah they're doing a real good job of uh separating it here and of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper	3201	A
and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup um and it's uh i think it started out to be um	3201	A
just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost uh i don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be	3201	A
but uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up	3201	A
yeah	3201	A
let's see oh and every year of course the phone books	3201	A
um they tell everybody across the city to um put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins	3201	A
because you know phone books are pretty well for a bigger city they're pretty thick and- and sometimes you might have two or three	3201	A
so uh that's that's a big savings right there in itself	3201	A
yeah hm	3201	A
um-hum	3201	A
um-hum well the thing about newspapers and paper recycled paper is actually very expensive	3201	A
so when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that it's uh they're not coming out ahead at all	3201	A
it's uh it's really a cost	3201	A
yeah	3201	A
i mean it it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something now aluminum i don't know they may be coming out ahead	3201	A
but i know for a fact that the paper	3201	A
uh on that end they're not you know it's it's good to recycle but it's uh not to their advantage and it costs less	3201	A
i can't think of anything else okay	3201	A
uh-huh	3201	A
well i hope y'all um uh come along a little farther in the future	3201	A
it was nice talking to you bye-bye	3201	A
well i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said well if there is a problem what should we do about it	3286	A
do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America	3286	A
okay that's interesting i was i was wondering what your response would be i'm a first generation American	3286	A
so i'm from immigrant parents or an immigrant mother anyway	3286	A
uh Poland	3286	A
and that was you know prior to World War Two	3286	A
but it's interesting that	3286	A
you know	3286	A
with the topic i think i agree with you there needs to be more of an open policy	3286	A
and you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor you know for the railroad Transatlantic Railroad and	3286	A
our Irish came and you know built the towns and	3286	A
did labor	3286	A
but what do you think are you from Texas or	3286	A
Pennsylvania okay well that'll be interesting	3286	A
because_1 we have just had a naturalization act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas i'm from Texas	3286	A
and have become citizens now	3286	A
what do you think about that	3286	A
well i agree with it wholeheartedly the only thing is i've got to share with you and my background is from New Jersey	3286	A
so when you were giving your answer i was thinking	3286	A
is this a Texan i'm talking to because_1 Texan philosophy is a little different	3286	A
um-hum	3286	A
yeah well we	3286	A
oh well then you have first in the experience on immigration	3286	A
well that is interesting	3286	A
yeah well- i well i wonder you know even with those that were involved with Tiananmen Square	3286	A
you know did we really protect them	3286	A
yeah	3286	A
that is true	3286	A
that is true	3286	A
well what do you think about we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population	3286	A
that has been brought in	3286	A
what do you think about that	3286	A
and these are not the brightest i mean we	3286	A
we're talking boat people	3286	A
we have a lot of boat people in Texas	3286	A
you're a true liberal heart-to-heart good for you i was ready for a fight on this one	3286	A
no i agree because_1 um interesting my when my daughter was in high school	3286	A
one of the custodians was Vietnamese	3286	A
and with his limited English they found out through- you know that- she was in student council and they found out that he was a medical doctor	3286	A
so what do you think about it	3286	B
right	3286	B
yeah i guess that's so	3286	B
um	3286	B
uh i think there are some problems but they're not really big ones i think that	3286	B
um	3286	B
in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be	3286	B
that it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here like even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America	3286	B
it's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that	3286	B
okay uh where did you come from	3286	B
okay okay so where did your parents come from	3286	B
okay	3286	B
and	3286	B
um-hum	3286	B
yeah	3286	B
um-hum	3286	B
yep	3286	B
um-hum	3286	B
i'm from Pennsylvania	3286	B
yeah	3286	B
right and um a lot of	3286	B
um-hum	3286	B
yeah	3286	B
um i think that's all right	3286	B
i um	3286	B
at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing do you have an opinion about it	3286	B
uh-huh	3286	B
uh-huh	3286	B
no okay	3286	B
right	3286	B
well a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China and um	3286	B
you know he	3286	B
um got a green card is and is in good standing in America and in China but only because he was always pretty nice to the Chinese government	3286	B
and all that and he was always on pretty good terms with them	3286	B
but um their	3286	B
my sister just had a baby and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing	3286	B
and it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem	3286	B
it's just very difficult to	3286	B
get a a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here	3286	B
yeah	3286	B
um-hum	3286	B
right	3286	B
yeah that's and i think that's pretty crazy because	3286	B
i mean those students who were in America when that was happening	3286	B
are	3286	B
almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back	3286	B
and	3286	B
besides that they're the best and brightest of China so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can	3286	B
yep	3286	B
um-hum	3286	B
yeah	3286	B
um	3286	B
see these are refugees you mean okay	3286	B
right okay	3286	B
right well um	3286	B
i don't have any problem with that um	3286	B
um-hum	3286	B
yeah	3286	B
okay my name is Terry	3214	B
okay	3214	B
oh yes uh there's Country Living there's Country and uh	3214	B
oh yeah	3214	B
sure	3214	B
oh that's great	3214	B
well i actually take Country Living it's a country magazine and House Beautiful because i like um that kind of stuff decorating and uh getting ideas for a garden in fact uh right before you called i was planning my tulips	3214	B
and uh putting them on blue print on where i'm gonna put them_1 so i'm really into that but uh so i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into um housing type things whether it be	3214	B
decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff so i'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at	3214	B
um-hum	3214	B
sure	3214	B
yeah	3214	B
yeah yeah we- i've had Time before i think with that what happens is uh	3214	B
it's interesting to read but you kind of just put the magazine away and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're gonna keep for your kids but	3214	B
um-hum	3214	B
it exactly you- you sound exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter but uh	3214	B
that's pretty similar but i find that with these Country magazines i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying jeez there was a flower garden in there that i seen that i would like to have some ideas you know so you get a lot of ideas from them	3214	B
yes we do we're out in the country we're right across from a river and uh you're right the leaves are beautiful and they are falling now so uh it just peaked uh last week and it was just gorgeous out here but	3214	B
yeah it's beautiful the other thing about magazines the only thing i don't like is they really get heavily into advertising and you know it's it's	3214	B
it's fine i'd rather almost have i know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying	3214	B
uh put my ad in your paper and i'll pay you or whatever but uh there's been some magazines i've looked at and it's a real turn off to see every other page uh some kind of ad	3214	B
yeah Vogue is heavily into that you know- yeah exactly it's almost- i mean you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way but uh	3214	B
uh-huh	3214	B
yeah exactly	3214	B
exactly yeah they're really getting into that so but pretty much like it said the magazines i've had Better Homes and Garden and now i need a switch and i'm going back to Gourmet Cooking because um i've had the magazine	3214	B
before back in nineteen uh eighty six and i thought well i'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine and you need to try and change	3214	B
uh yes i do and sometimes most of the time i tear them_1 out a lot of times if uh you know if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter i'll go ahead and type out recipes but	3214	B
what i usually do is i'll try it out in the magazine first and uh without tearing it out and then give it a yeah and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection but uh	3214	B
yes	3214	B
um-hum	3214	B
sure sure	3214	B
uh-huh	3214	B
yeah it it that's what i- i just went through uh we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin i went through all this i had this huge stack of House Beautiful i had Colonial Times i had Gourmet	3214	B
yeah	3214	B
it was hard but i ended up uh reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of uh hundreds and i just said okay there's one picture in there that it really doesn't	3214	B
you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything so i just kind of went through and i find that most of the magazines i really like is around Christmas time because it helps me	3214	B
okay uh my name is Karen	3214	A
so i get all of them_1 uh the one that i really especially enjoy and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin is called Country	3214	A
well this yeah this one is the one that has all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live like Wisconsin	3214	A
gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things and i get that it has recipes in it and that's my very favorite	3214	A
what do you take	3214	A
uh-huh	3214	A
yeah decorating uh-huh	3214	A
are you	3214	A
oh	3214	A
and decorating and how to do things uh-huh	3214	A
yeah	3214	A
well we we tried for a while to take a news magazine we took Newsweek and i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested but we've kind of discontinued that right now and we've we're gonna start taking that uh US News	3214	A
uh newspaper USA Today i think it is-	3214	A
yeah	3214	A
uh-huh	3214	A
that's right	3214	A
that's exactly right i did the same thing we saved the ones from the election and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake and then	3214	A
and um-hum uh-huh	3214	A
well you sound like you- that's the thing you sound like you have the facilities to do that	3214	A
oh	3214	A
oh	3214	A
i bet it is gorgeous	3214	A
i agree	3214	A
um-hum	3214	A
yeah right	3214	A
every page i did the same thing i- i think i opened Vogue the other day or something and it was just nothing um-hum and i thought why buy this you know what's the point	3214	A
that's right and my number one pet peeve in a magazine is when they put the perfume in it	3214	A
uh-huh	3214	A
oh	3214	A
i understand well do you do you tear out of your magazine your recipes or do you keep it	3214	A
um-hum	3214	A
type it off uh-huh	3214	A
see how the family liked it	3214	A
oh that's a good idea well i'm gonna pay attention more when i'm in the store to that Country Living i remember seeing the cover back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country uh primitive things	3214	A
the little the little pigs and the geese and the ducks and that- we had that was the big rage here couple of years ago and i bought a lot of the country magazines and then it seems like when i put some of that away i quit buying it but i had forgotten the recipes	3214	A
and i'm gonna i'll have to check that out	3214	A
uh-huh	3214	A
and you don't wanna part with any of them_1 because_1 there's one thing in each one	3214	A
oh that's good	3214	A
uh-huh right	3214	A
right	3214	A
i i know-	3214	A
do you have any pets	3240	A
holy Nellie	3240	A
i oh i guess we have one miniature Dachshund	3240	A
oh i don't think i could cope with that many how do- how do you uh avoid having your house smell	3240	A
um-hum	3240	A
um do you let your rabbit run around loose	3240	A
okay i- i knew somebody who said they were easy to uh litter box train but she had trouble with it chewing on wood	3240	A
oh how what kind of a dog do you have	3240	A
um-hum	3240	A
uh do they get along	3240	A
see we our dog hates every other animal and our we have a couple children that are are grown and on their own and every once in a while they will come home for a visit with an animal	3240	A
and our our dog just about has a stroke	3240	A
well	3240	A
um-hum	3240	A
well we we kind of joke that that our our dog's about eight years old and but one son was between jobs for a couple of weeks and was here with a Golden Retriever	3240	A
and uh when he left you know we swear the our dog's muzzle turned white	3240	A
and then uh our our other son	3240	A
is in the Navy and was being relocated to go to school down at College Station so he was here for a couple days in between waiting for his household goods and stuff and with a beagle puppy	3240	A
well i think they're i think they're good company i have been trying for years to convince my mother who lives alone	3240	A
that she would like a a dog she loves it when she comes here and our dog sits on her lap you know and she'll just sit there and pet him and pet him and i'll say you need an animal he would	3240	A
and	3240	A
yes um-hum	3240	A
well and i- i think they're good for kids in that they can teach the kids responsibility	3240	A
you know if if you if you have a a kid who wants an animal badly enough and agrees to take care of it i mean it's a responsibility cleaning up after it and	3240	A
um you feeding it making sure it has water and uh you know just just all that kind of stuff that's that's good also uh	3240	A
but we just have a we we in the past we've had Great Danes	3240	A
which were probably the best pets we've ever had	3240	A
yeah- oh they were well the first one we had was wonderful she just finally died of old age but she was just so the the greatest house pet and uh we were asked when she was probably about ten years old when our our youngest one was born	3240	A
and she would totally ignore this baby i mean the dog could be laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room and the dog would just kind of	3240	A
sniff and walk- walk out of the room and would have absolutely nothing to do with the baby until uh she got old enough to sit in the high chair and throw food over	3240	A
yet and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay but yeah but then my husband decided it would- might be nice to have a lap dog for a change	3240	A
now he just really likes having a dog that curls up in his lap when he watches TV and sits in his recliner and falls asleep	3240	A
uh what what-	3240	A
yeah i have five cats two dogs a snake and a bunny	3240	B
that's enough to keep anybody busy with pets how about_1 you	3240	B
um i think i'm envious	3240	B
well my cats are indoor outdoor cats and	3240	B
but most of my cats go outside so there's not that much there i only have one who stays inside	3240	B
oh no it's in a cage lot of people do but i've never been able to quite handle that with a rabbit	3240	B
no i've never i've never even tried it to be honest with you	3240	B
it's really my daughter's rabbit	3240	B
um i have i have one that's kind of a Golden Retriever mutt	3240	B
that means a mix and then my daughter just got an American Eskimo	3240	B
right	3240	B
well he's probably older and he's used to being the only dog and it's hard for him just like people it's hard for them to give up their	3240	B
their place as the only one and kind of share the attention but almost all of my animals are used to not being the only one in the house and so they're kind of used to being part of a group	3240	B
uh-huh	3240	B
maybe he's just getting old	3240	B
turns him gray one of the things they mentioned was why do you think people have pets	3240	B
i think so too i really think that they are wonderful therapy they're they're just- companionship i'm	3240	B
obviously i'm a i'm a real believer in them	3240	B
yes i think so too	3240	B
feeding it	3240	B
that's right	3240	B
ooh that's a big dog	3240	B
really	3240	B
oh yeah	3240	B
um here's a source	3240	B
yeah	3240	B
sure	3240	B
that's neat that's neat	3240	B
why don't you go ahead and start	3250	B
um-hum	3250	B
um-hum	3250	B
um-hum	3250	B
yeah i well i have in a while- for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because_1 uh	3250	B
i have so much going on in my life that seems to be the last thing i pick up so i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them_1	3250	B
uh when i do subscribe i- i've gotten in the past the Parents magazine and uh the Housekeeping magazine and uh	3250	B
yes yeah	3250	B
yeah yeah	3250	B
right well i found that after a couple of years of having a Parents magazine it was getting repetitious so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason	3250	B
uh the Housekeeping magazines i do like because they like you say they have nice uh recipes in them and ideas but uh lately they just been piling up on me so i figured it wasn't uh something i needed at this point in time	3250	B
i don't know i- i well my husband would love to have more now he's the type who will get the uh Inc magazine and Money magazine and all the financial type magazines	3250	B
yeah	3250	B
uh-huh yes	3250	B
um-hum	3250	B
um-hum	3250	B
um-hum	3250	B
well	3250	B
yeah and and some of those that have what what i consider or what i get the idea that they're maybe the	3250	B
the more pricier type magazines as far as women's magazines they seem to be just so chocked full of of ads	3250	B
uh-huh	3250	B
yeah yeah	3250	B
yes	3250	B
right yeah	3250	B
yes yeah	3250	B
yes	3250	B
um-hum um-hum	3250	B
yes i enjoy books a lot more that's true	3250	B
well yeah i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to other than my children have gotten- you know they get tons of magazines it seems they they're always getting something in the mail	3250	B
and uh so between reading to them and uh reading the newspaper and then i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance but i just don't get a chance for those	3250	B
uh newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads unless you just want to skim through while you're i- i read them_1 when i'm at a doctor's office or you know waiting on something like that	3250	B
yeah	3250	B
um-hum um-hum	3250	B
oh uh-huh	3250	B
um-hum	3250	B
yeah	3250	B
um-hum um-hum	3250	B
that's true that kind of is a good way to do it	3250	B
yeah yeah	3250	B
okay	3250	B
okay	3250	A
okay well we subscribe to People magazine and to Time	3250	A
and course i like the People magazine because it's gossipy	3250	A
and it's fast reading and uh the Time of course is uh you know more newsworthy and	3250	A
and uh	3250	A
it has more world affair type things of course	3250	A
and then i will purchase a Good Housekeeping occasionally especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and	3250	A
and things like that and uh do you subscribe to any magazines	3250	A
uh-huh you probably have smaller children younger children my children are our children are grown	3250	A
and uh i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren	3250	A
well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to	3250	A
yes now my husband does that and you know and of course uh naturally Wall Street Journal you know and or Sports Illustrated but i don't know i know i see people leafing through them_1 at the store	3250	A
but you just don't hear people talk about them and i know years ago when uh my children were young and stuff	3250	A
i just loved Ladies' Home Journal McCall's Good Housekeeping and i took them all and um	3250	A
then oh i don't know what in the seventies maybe late seventies they changed their format and i haven't	3250	A
i don't think there as good a magazine as they used to be even Good Housekeeping i don't	3250	A
oh they are my sister uh takes uh	3250	A
Town and Country and Vogue	3250	A
and she sends them to me and there's really nothing in them_1 but advertisements for very expensive clothes very expensive jewelry	3250	A
things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing	3250	A
you know and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living	3250	A
you know then i can i look through them_1 and i do i just what i do is i flip through them_1 and and pitch them_1 then you know they're not something i you know take any length of time over	3250	A
i have discovered that you know with my available time i would rather actually read a book than a magazine	3250	A
yes and um so but	3250	A
yes	3250	A
yes yes i will read them_1 in a doctor's office too as i said i- i subscribe to uh to People and to Time and uh	3250	A
and i will go through the Time but usually not to- cover to cover you know i'll glance through it i'll like reading uh	3250	A
you know the Passage of People or something you know and uh but i do like the People magazine it it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young	3250	A
and uh that's one and you know i really like that i enjoy that it's quick reading	3250	A
i just i want fluff i don't want a lot of thinking	3250	A
it uh you know it's it's much more relaxing sometimes when i read Time- Time magazine after i've read an article i'm real depressed over the situation of the world	3250	A
so well it seems like we both kind of agree on on the subject of magazines	3250	A
and uh so uh i think that probably i will end the call i've enjoyed	3250	A
well i almost forgot the topic i was waiting so long for uh for it to find somebody	3223	A
uh	3223	A
right well so what is your favorite TV show	3223	A
oh you like that one	3223	A
um-hum i've- i've never really watched that one you know it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows	3223	A
and uh you know there's so there's only a few that i that i like to watch routinely	3223	A
probably my favorite is um	3223	A
oh well i- i like shows like Growing Pains and uh what's the other one now they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night so i don't get to watch it very much	3223	A
Wonder Years yeah that's my favorite uh	3223	A
yeah	3223	A
yeah Wonder Years i- i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever i guess i can really- really relate to it and uh it's just a real cute show	3223	A
uh i- i guess i like the shows that really have a a real sense of uh i don't know honesty or sort of a purity value i guess	3223	A
uh-huh yeah	3223	A
right right	3223	A
uh-huh yeah my wife really likes that show	3223	A
uh-huh	3223	A
yeah	3223	A
yeah well there was but there's a sense of honesty- i guess purity in the show like one of my favorite shows used to be Happy Days but uh	3223	A
you know Richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure i guess and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it and i never did like it after that	3223	A
so i- i don't know i- i say see the same thing in like Wonder Years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere	3223	A
yeah uh-huh	3223	A
uh-huh	3223	A
so you're gonna watch a game tonight	3223	A
so do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything	3223	A
oh uh-huh	3223	A
yeah	3223	A
yeah yeah he's a nice guy i- i take it you live in the Dallas area do you live in the Dallas area	3223	A
uh-huh yeah i live in Garland and yeah i- i like Steve Bushel but i don't really like the Pirates i'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan so uh i'm kind of i'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all they you know they	3223	A
they've come from so far down i really would like to see them_1 do well	3223	A
yeah one one year then maybe they'll make it i don't know	3223	A
so but uh yeah i'd like sports programming quite a bit but	3223	A
uh i guess my my favorite shows are the and you know the getting back to a point that you made that's really true we are watching Roseanne i guess couple of weeks ago and	3223	A
her daughter was talking about birth control you know and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time and you know she's only seven years old so	3223	A
yeah	3223	A
yeah	3223	A
yeah yeah	3223	A
yeah well that that seems to be more our values too like like the Wonder Years i- i mean	3223	A
uh it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers you know or and- and you can kind of relate to it you know i don't know that's i enjoy that a lot	3223	A
but uh you know i- i- i agree with you the and it's funny because the shows	3223	A
like a lot of them_1 that used to be considered risque like Three's Company and stuff i think they they maintained people would watch them_1 because there was that uh	3223	A
you know there was really the period that was going on there i mean he really wasn't messing around with the girls but everybody perceived him that way and stuff	3223	A
but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died	3223	A
and it's it's interesting that- that a lot of the shows are that way	3223	A
it was- it's on your favorite TV shows and why	3223	B
uh Major Dad	3223	B
i- i love it i think it promotes good family values and it's funny	3223	B
that's right- yeah uh	3223	B
what kind do you like to watch	3223	B
Wonder Years	3223	B
i like both of those real much also i- i think basically they promote- same thing they promote family values	3223	B
i do too i- i don't like it uh lot of the shows that that i've liked in the past like uh oh Golden Girls and some of them_1 tend to get so risque and when you have children	3223	B
uh watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me and uh	3223	B
that's one of the reasons i mean if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was Little House on the Prairie	3223	B
yeah which i just i always- i always felt was wonderful uh and so many of them_1 nowadays like i said i think are just um	3223	B
uh they they go after	3223	B
well like i said the risque stuff just i guess they think that's what people want to watch	3223	B
yes	3223	B
yeah	3223	B
um-hum	3223	B
um-hum	3223	B
yeah i- i agree uh do you like the sports programming	3223	B
um i- i enjoy those also almost as as much to a certain extent i'm our whole house is baseball fans and uh we enjoy that and uh	3223	B
oh yeah	3223	B
oh yeah they're	3223	B
uh	3223	B
probably the Pirates	3223	B
but only because of Steve Bushel i guess otherwise i really don't care that much but uh you know i'm i'm	3223	B
annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him and uh i'd	3223	B
with as much	3223	B
pardon	3223	B
uh live in- live in Plano	3223	B
um-hum	3223	B
um-hum	3223	B
well yeah yeah it's uh	3223	B
it's what i keep hoping the Rangers are going to do	3223	B
right	3223	B
um-hum	3223	B
well it's so many of them now um you know it it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in and and uh	3223	B
you know i'm you know i'm i'm an adult and i have adult tastes now but i don't need that	3223	B
uh i- i like things that uh	3223	B
uh are wholesome i guess	3223	B
um-hum	3223	B
yes yes	3223	B
um-hum	3223	B
yeah	3223	B
what do you like to watch on television Maureen	3257	A
yes	3257	A
uh-huh uh-huh well we have cable but we only have Cinemax and uh i think our favorite night is uh Monday night and we start out with Evening Shade	3257	A
and Major Dad and i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television you know my husband's always got it on i'm not always sitting down at it	3257	A
yes yes yes i just i love that all those that- that two hours and uh now tonight i just finished up with that A Woman Called Jackie did you watch did you watch it	3257	A
yeah it was- it was pretty good it uh sometimes i like a dramatization and i like uh USA when they have their uh uh mystery movies and things their made for TV movies	3257	A
and uh i like those and we very seldom watch any uh Public Television channel thirteen do you watch it much	3257	A
yes	3257	A
yes it is now we haven't watched any of those	3257	A
yes now we have watched some things on that	3257	A
yeah we had uh i don't know my husband loves to uh	3257	A
but our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here because lots of times they will have things on uh animals and they just thoroughly	3257	A
you know enjoy that in fact i think they were watching something on uh	3257	A
whales or killer sharks- sharks one or the other couple of weeks ago over here and uh so we have watched that and uh otherwise of course my husband's into the football	3257	A
and you know i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else you know with him and uh but other	3257	A
yes	3257	A
yes and sometimes now we're getting it- that uh the other football where they play it	3257	A
Saturdays and Sundays this is fine but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know all of that and uh but he will uh he'll flip around i think the other night we had on uh	3257	A
uh it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down i don't know what channel he found that on	3257	A
and uh but he will turn that on especially for if again if our uh oldest grandson is over here he's ten and uh they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it i you know	3257	A
and uh so and Sundays uh we usually have all of our kids are over on Sunday so you know we don't get into that except that sometimes we'll get into the home videos	3257	A
do you ever watch that	3257	A
yeah um-hum	3257	A
that are sometimes so dumb	3257	A
but very true to life i mean i've seen our family in several of those situations	3257	A
well i guess a lot of the uh something that's kind of more of a comedy we do have uh cable and we have premium stations like HBO and Showtime and such and	3257	B
prime time on some of the standard channels as much i- i tend to go to my premium channels first	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
yeah	3257	B
Monday night's pretty good with Murphy Brown and Designing Women	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
uh-huh	3257	B
we had watched it uh i guess Sunday night and Monday night but we didn't get to watch it tonight	3257	B
um-hum um-hum	3257	B
the only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights starting fairly late like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe till midnight they have some British comedy	3257	B
that we've we've really liked a there's a variety some of them_1 is uh Black Adder or Good Neighbors or Yes Prime Minister and Are You Being Served they they rotate those around	3257	B
and um we like that British comedy British comedy is very fast you really have to listen but	3257	B
they're real good but they do come on kind of late but we really do enjoy those sometimes we get to watching some stuff on Discovery Channel	3257	B
and i'm amazed sometimes what i see on there but i'm very intrigued i one time i was watching a operation and i thought gee i- i don't believe i'm watching this	3257	B
yeah	3257	B
yeah right right	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
oh	3257	B
right	3257	B
yeah i'm not into watching sports now my husband likes to watch football	3257	B
he's not really into uh baseball or basketball too much but uh football soon as it's fall then he likes to watch college on Saturday and then of course Cowboys on Sunday	3257	B
yeah	3257	B
um	3257	B
hm	3257	B
um-hum	3257	B
oh	3257	B
um	3257	B
yeah the you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff yeah those are pretty good yeah	3257	B
but true to life i mean some of those	3257	B
uh yes uh we have two sons uh one's a freshman in college and one's a sophomore in high school and you	3260	B
okay_1	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
uh well uh	3260	B
yeah we spend a lot- spend a did spend a lot of time uh it really helped when the uh older one was old enough to get his license and could uh	3260	B
drive around by himself although that brought in a whole another set of problems but uh for yeah for one thing uh	3260	B
but yeah we uh we do but our two had had uh totally different interests so that there- there was not much uh overlap	3260	B
as such the the older one is not was not at all into uh sports for the most part uh he participated band and and uh scouts were his two big things and uh	3260	B
and the younger- younger one is uh	3260	B
so uh yeah we spend a lot of time uh uh carpooling and uh you know and then trying to be uh at as much as possible with anything that they that they do but then uh	3260	B
we also did do spend uh time with them trying to trying to uh you know just family time uh	3260	B
we at a at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth and and uh	3260	B
uh although we didn't uh do it as much or as often as uh i would have liked to i would like to do that as a as a family and and some TV watching what about you	3260	B
yeah i've- i've i've heard of that i've never actually never actually played it but	3260	B
yeah yep	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah so do we	3260	B
okay_1	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
oh now that's neat yeah no we never had anything like like that but that	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
um-hum	3260	B
um-hum	3260	B
oh well good well i you know in terms of in terms of any sorts of trends i	3260	B
you know obviously- obviously things are different from for- for me than and my children than when i was growing up i- i- i grew up on a farm uh in Iowa and uh	3260	B
you know the whole family was around the the whole time and and what my father did was was uh interseting- you know obvious to me and i i helped out with it but	3260	B
uh although i have brought my boys into to see where i work it's not that easy and it's it's certainly not	3260	B
at all common and they they just don't really have that same idea so that there's uh it's it's a whole different uh kind of thing there then then uh	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah yeah well that makes it hard though for in terms of you know family time with with him	3260	B
yeah i've been lucky in that respect that i don't uh don't travel too much	3260	B
oh	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yes	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah	3260	B
yeah right	3260	B
do you have children	3260	A
ah	3260	A
i have one that's a freshman in high school a daughter and a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school	3260	A
and i spend most of my time carpooling the story of my life	3260	A
my kids are involved in sports my daughters played basketball for six years and my son plays football i my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year	3260	A
because_1 there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere	3260	A
yes	3260	A
i know i know the insurance	3260	A
yes my son is in both band and scouts too	3260	A
oh gee	3260	A
right	3260	A
uh-huh	3260	A
yeah	3260	A
we found this Oriental tile game called mah-jongg	3260	A
have you	3260	A
well it's really fun um one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis and a lot of them played it and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people	3260	A
and it's a game that none of their friends know how to play and they both enjoy it so if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad so uh we play that a lot with them	3260	A
and uh we like to go miniature golfing and to movies we have family that lives outside of the state so we	3260	A
go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips so that and my husband and son go camping	3260	A
with scouts mostly my daughter and- and i hate camping so we go shopping so that just kind of works out real well and um i'm a writer	3260	A
by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too so a lot of times she and i will travel to writers conferences together	3260	A
yes	3260	A
yeah so that gives us special time together too and she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so i can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too so	3260	A
yep	3260	A
yes	3260	A
right	3260	A
my husband's taken us to work with him and we still don't know what he does so we just say he travels a lot so that kind of covers it	3260	A
yes	3260	A
yeah	3260	A
he's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months	3260	A
yes so those are the real killers if he's just gone he's gone three weeks right now and that's that's mild compared to the big ones so we just you know	3260	A
i just do the carpooling and and handle whatever needs to be done and something major always needs to be done so	3260	A
you just have to to handle it till he gets home	3260	A
and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home	3260	A
um i don't i	3207	A
i am only twenty eight and i haven't had much experience with nursing homes i don't i have never visited any i don't think i've ever even been in one have you	3207	A
uh-huh	3207	A
and it takes- it takes a lot of care like twenty four hours a day someone has to be well- like there's someone in my my fiance's family his grandmother too and they're	3207	A
that his- her	3207	A
son his uncle whatever you know anyway he- he has he recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and and all the other children	3207	A
um are working or whatever they're all my parent's age and uh so he's got you know his retirement though is really twenty four hours a day they have a	3207	A
day care two days a week they call it senior citizen day care but she goes to the senior citizen center	3207	A
so she- he gets a break two days a week but it's only for like two or three hours at a time	3207	A
and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was always a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now	3207	A
but he refuses to consider any other	3207	A
i- i don't know yeah and is that how your parents feel or	3207	A
uh-huh	3207	A
uh-huh	3207	A
i know at this i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either you know but i- i really feel bad for the people i see that- not very i'm not really really experienced but like i said just have that one	3207	A
family and that's really so bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be but	3207	A
yeah and he's got you know seven brothers and sisters and and uh he's the one because he's the one that doesn't going to work everyday and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone and	3207	A
i can't say much oh well that's great that's a good idea we ought to	3207	A
i can't say much but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either and i wonder i'm gonna be the only	3207	A
sibling that isn't gonna have children so if my parents do need to live with someone it'll probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for	3207	A
you know and i'm i that's fine with me my fiancee i both figure that's what's we're gonna end up with both of the parents or whoever if it you know what i mean we feel like it's our responsibility and i feel like i would never put them_1 in a home	3207	A
but i wonder how much you know if one of us is gonna have to quit work someday or retire early or something you think about it and	3207	A
it's really i don't know this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country and	3207	A
it's really more of a um like a respect issue	3207	A
and- that the older the older people in other countries that i've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people and and they really seen as wise and and in this country nobody really	3207	A
yeah nobody really pays attention and they oh the old timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions and you know it's	3207	A
i- i'm not saying that i do either but you know it's just funny and and we really don't have any they don't have social security and everything really isn't that much for	3207	A
elderly people to live on you know even if they're in good health it's incredible they don't have any they don't get special treatment and maybe they should you know because_1 we're all gonna get old someday	3207	A
so it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother	3207	A
um actually i have um	3207	B
i've i've been in them_1	3207	B
but um just visiting and	3207	B
um we used to go- when we're like in- in our teenagers we'd go on Sundays and visit you know the older people but um i have a elderly grandmother that lives with us	3207	B
and she's lived with us for like five years so i kind of know how it is to have to decide if you wanna put somebody in a rest home or	3207	B
um like we i mean we've had those discussions you know about should we put her in or because_1 she's pretty senile and	3207	B
yeah	3207	B
it's really-	3207	B
um-hum	3207	B
oh really	3207	B
um-hum	3207	B
right	3207	B
to put her in a rest home	3207	B
um well see it's more of my grandma that feels that way she says that when her husband died that he said	3207	B
oh that my uncle had said that he would never have- put her in a rest home	3207	B
so it's kind of	3207	B
uh i don't know i don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to	3207	B
have like a little toilet right by her bed it's and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so	3207	B
it gets	3207	B
i don't know it's it's a hard decision but i don't think i would do it to my parents personally	3207	B
when he retired	3207	B
yeah and it's worked out good for us just because my uncle and my and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months	3207	B
so that that works out good	3207	B
um-hum	3207	B
really	3207	B
uh-huh	3207	B
um-hum	3207	B
you think i i	3207	B
i'm not really familiar with how other countries	3207	B
they're seen as senile	3207	B
right-	3207	B
um-hum	3207	B
right	3207	B
um-hum	3207	B
i know	3207	B
um i'm twenty	3207	B
yeah it's it really is but and she	3207	B
she drives us crazy-	3207	B
so do you have an opinion on credit cards	3275	B
you do	3275	B
i think they get a lot of people in trouble	3275	B
uh-huh	3275	B
yeah and then you don't stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you don't stop to think about it	3275	B
i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble	3275	B
and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a Visa card and i never use them_1 unless i need to	3275	B
so	3275	B
but they	3275	B
yeah	3275	B
that's a good idea	3275	B
stops all them interest rates and interest rates aren't	3275	B
none too shallow these days anyway	3275	B
but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them_1 especially you know we have i'm in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech	3275	B
and they seem to get in trouble with them_1 a lot	3275	B
yeah	3275	B
jeez	3275	B
yeah something like that	3275	B
yeah	3275	B
well my wife got in trouble one time with hers and	3275	B
she was making like	3275	B
i don't know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think	3275	B
and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month	3275	B
so and that was before we got married so	3275	B
but it's you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it's	3275	B
it's come out pretty good now we have a	3275	B
eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college and	3275	B
that's the first thing he wanted	3275	B
yeah	3275	B
so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick	3275	B
you know so	3275	B
but i think they're too readily accessible and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them_1 to you and get you draft- get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle when	3275	B
you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and uh	3275	B
we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so	3275	B
and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need	3275	B
so	3275	B
yeah	3275	B
i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have	3275	B
course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so i guess they'd trade one for the other	3275	B
i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other	3275	B
well that's good i'm it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so	3275	B
are you yeah	3275	B
all right	3275	B
yeah	3275	B
yeah it's pretty easy	3275	B
uh we have a eighteen year old a seventeen year old and a seven year old	3275	B
yeah	3275	B
oh are you	3275	B
are you a you're a Mormon then	3275	B
uh-huh	3275	B
all right	3275	B
what's that	3275	B
oh yeah they may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays	3275	B
uh fifteen or twenty i guess	3275	B
oh yeah	3275	B
i try to every day i uh i get calls at work i get calls at home so	3275	B
um i do	3275	A
what do- what do you think about them_1	3275	A
yeah definitely i have one right now and	3275	A
um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it- it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get	3275	A
yeah	3275	A
oh my goodness	3275	A
really	3275	A
that's good yeah- yeah i'd i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have to rip it up so	3275	A
that's	3275	A
yeah that	3275	A
um-hum i have i have a couple friends too that have about_1 three of them_1 {maxed} out and they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them_1 off and and and like one of my friends	3275	A
she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she does- she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because_1 she's going to school	3275	A
and and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like	3275	A
like monthly fee like twenty- yeah you have- i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all she's paying is interest on hers every month	3275	A
it just seems crazy to	3275	A
to me but	3275	A
yeah	3275	A
oh really	3275	A
was it Visa card	3275	A
oh my goodness	3275	A
i bet	3275	A
yeah i'm i don't know i'm about_1 sick of mine right now	3275	A
i don't	3275	A
um-hum	3275	A
right	3275	A
exactly yeah my parents are really good about	3275	A
not using credit cards they are against it i don't think they like the fact that i have one either	3275	A
um-hum	3275	A
yeah	3275	A
hm	3275	A
yeah i'm nineteen- i'm twenty right now so just going to school and	3275	A
and working so	3275	A
it does kind of get in when you want something that like last weekend was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them_1 and on my credit card i didn't didn't have the money to do it	3275	A
yep	3275	A
it sure is so do you just have two kids or	3275	A
oh really	3275	A
neat	3275	A
i'm from Plano Texas	3275	A
but right now i'm out in Provo Utah going to BYU so	3275	A
yep	3275	A
yep	3275	A
but this is a extra long one	3275	A
hey they're giving us a lot of time	3275	A
yeah	3275	A
have you done a lot of this	3275	A
oh really	3275	A
do you do it every day	3275	A
what-	3275	A
uh-huh	3232	B
oh no i don't have any children but i'm still going to college uh-huh NC State	3232	B
um well it's a lot of work	3232	B
my Bachelor's uh-huh	3232	B
um it's actually in computer science and i have a special interest in Voice IO	3232	B
no i'm actually from Amarillo Texas originally	3232	B
uh-huh	3232	B
um the service	3232	B
yeah	3232	B
uh-huh	3232	B
uh-huh	3232	B
ooh	3232	B
it would have played a major part in mine	3232	B
uh-huh	3232	B
golly	3232	B
yeah luckily i've paid in state tuition the whole time	3232	B
um-hum um	3232	B
uh-huh	3232	B
the second thing is some colleges only offer the uh Liberal Arts	3232	B
and uh whereas like State they offer engineering courses	3232	B
so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to attend somewhere- um attend somewhere like Tech	3232	B
and um aside from the uh well some schools may even give you financial aid where another one won't	3232	B
oh really	3232	B
hm	3232	B
wow that's great was it a Pell grant	3232	B
what kind of grant was it	3232	B
uh-huh	3232	B
um-hum	3232	B
um-hum	3232	B
wow	3232	B
uh-huh	3232	B
hm	3232	B
uh i'm not quite there's there's a lot of different organizations who uh who do give grants but uh	3232	B
i'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how- how much that they you know they generally run	3232	B
um-hum	3232	B
golly that's great	3232	B
oh another thing i've got a i've got a degree from another college and uh something that might play a part is the size of the college	3232	B
uh lots- the smaller schools can give you a lot uh a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and	3232	B
and they just give you a teacher's assistants you know instead of a scholar you get a TA	3232	B
and uh you don't get near the uh quality of education and as well the uh smaller schools often times don't cost as much	3232	B
oh yeah	3232	B
um-hum	3232	B
um-hum	3232	B
hm	3232	B
um	3232	B
oh i at State i think it's just a waste of somebody's money to go there	3232	B
it's really a shame because of you know the instruction um i'd rather go to any other college you know in the state and i would definitely get my money's worth uh much better than State	3232	B
it's kind of unfortunate because they've they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students anymore	3232	B
yeah they're they're bent on uh seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much uh how much of the campus they can build up	3232	B
and uh yeah it's really a bad situation here	3232	B
okay i guess our topic is um advice about going to college do you have children of your own	3232	A
oh are you what school are you going to	3232	A
oh are you enjoying it	3232	A
are you working on your um	3232	A
Bachelor's degree and what field of study are you in	3232	A
uh-huh	3232	A
oh well that's neat are you from North Carolina	3232	A
oh are you really oh	3232	A
well what took you to North Carolina	3232	A
oh i see	3232	A
well that was one of the things i was thinking about in school um when i went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock	3232	A
and uh i had a friend my roommate went to Tech also but she was from New Mexico	3232	A
and she had to pay out of state tuition and i think that would have uh played a real big part in my decision	3232	A
yeah because um she was paying- of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now it was like four dollars a semester hour	3232	A
and so i was going to school for you know just a few hundred dollars a semester and she was paying forty dollars an hour so she's paying ten times as much because she was out of state	3232	A
oh that's good	3232	A
yeah so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that um i liked well enough to attend	3232	A
uh-huh	3232	A
right yeah	3232	A
yeah right	3232	A
yeah that's true that was something else i had was i had government aid of course but uh it was wonderful because i got one of those grants that you don't have to repay	3232	A
and yeah it was so nice it paid most of my tuition and um a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing so yeah i really	3232	A
i'm sorry what did you say	3232	A
well it was called a BEOG a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant and it was from the government and it was based at first it was based on my parents' income my parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to	3232	A
send any of us to school and so uh because based on the number of children and the amount of money uh	3232	A
my father brought in i got a small grant but then after that i was on my own working and you know trying to go to school on my own	3232	A
so it was kind of nice i don't know if those are still available or not but	3232	A
yeah yeah well this was great it was just based on you know how much your tuition costs and everything and generally it paid everything so i went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing so that was	3232	A
yeah it was really nice	3232	A
uh-huh	3232	A
right	3232	A
um-hum	3232	A
yeah	3232	A
um-hum	3232	A
um-hum	3232	A
that's right	3232	A
hm i didn't know that	3232	A
well i guess the only comparison i had ever heard was between um	3232	A
a Christian college because i thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech	3232	A
and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech um the Christian college was so much more expensive	3232	A
but i guess some of the other colleges- smaller colleges might might be a lot different	3232	A
really	3232	A
yeah	3232	A
um-hum	3232	A
yeah huh	3232	A
yeah yeah you're just a number	3232	A
um	3232	A
right	3232	A
yeah	3232	A
oh that's a shame	3232	A
well i- i felt a little cheated at Tech also once i got into my i um majored in	3232	A
i work at NCNB i'm a lawyer	3258	B
so	3258	B
i wear a suit	3258	B
oh okay	3258	B
oh you can wear pants	3258	B
wow	3258	B
i've worn them_1 in the winter when it's like ten degrees and you know no one's going to look	3258	B
oh	3258	B
oh yeah	3258	B
already	3258	B
i didn't own a winter coat to wear to work until um	3258	B
two years ago	3258	B
i mean my whole i what do i graduated college in eighty three	3258	B
and i have not bought one until two years ago	3258	B
because_1 you just don't need it	3258	B
when did you get here	3258	B
oh so you got the summer	3258	B
yeah i guess they that uh	3258	B
it it did not get hot here this summer	3258	B
don't don't send for them	3258	B
a couple	3258	B
you have more more than one oh God	3258	B
um	3258	B
no we have a lot of the women in our office even are believe it or not uh banks are not that bad and we don't meet with customers you know we work for the	3258	B
for the um oh you know we work with the banking officers	3258	B
so we don't have people come in and look at us and we wear fun stuff too like um oh shorter skirts and	3258	B
uh you know a lot of dresses	3258	B
um-hum	3258	B
i just wear	3258	B

yes but uh	3258	B
well you'll get	3258	B
are you in Plano	3258	B
ooh	3258	B
that's up on Hillcrest and LBJ	3258	B
but yeah that's um well i'm i'm more used to downtown	3258	B
so um	3258	B
i	3258	B
i never lived North of	3258	B
well you don't need to	3258	B
believe me you don't need to	3258	B
lots of street people	3258	B
the School Book Depository	3258	B
yeah there are lots of bums on the street and	3258	B
uh	3258	B
if you go i went to work this morning early and i had to i parked in a fourteen dollar parking garage	3258	B
well uh you know i- i mean i got there at four o'clock in the morning and	3258	B
and uh i'm not going to walk you you know walk anywhere downtown at that time of the day	3258	B
and so you park- park where you can go directly in on the tunnel	3258	B
um-hum	3258	B
i'm glad i'm a native so i always like to hear that	3258	B
just like decided to move here	3258	B
golly	3258	B
oh okay	3258	B
yeah except down here it's a dime a day- well	3258	B
not really if he's if he's Anglo yeah an Anglo who speaks Spanish	3258	B
okay um where do you work	3258	A
oh okay	3258	A
um so you probably wear the suits every day	3258	A
yeah i was i bet um i work at JC Penney finance	3258	A
and i wear suits um sometimes you know the dress a nice dress or a nice pant outfit	3258	A
yes as long as we have the nylons and that and heels on	3258	A
so that's kind of nice	3258	A
uh-huh well that's see i just moved here from South Dakota	3258	A
but uh they just got uh they're down to thirty degrees now	3258	A
yeah and they've gotten snow and the whole bit so when i was there i would wear everything you know	3258	A
oh really	3258	A
uh-huh	3258	A
oh really	3258	A
huh-uh you know when i- i moved here and it's it's just great i call back there and it's just you know it's wonderful to be able to wear no coat you know and just a dress and and go to work	3258	A
June first	3258	A
yeah and it wasn't too bad um because_1 there they can have both extremes	3258	A
so we can	3258	A
it can get really hot	3258	A
that's what i was told	3258	A
that it was pretty mild but that's when i moved and i left all my winter clothes with my mom in Nebraska	3258	A
okay i- i just brought a couple and it's like they're still sitting in the closet	3258	A
yeah i oh i have six of them_1 and all the essentials- essentials	3258	A
but	3258	A
yeah all you know we just have to wear the nice clothes and the and which i was really surprised that i wouldn't have to be in the suit	3258	A
uh-huh	3258	A
um-hum	3258	A
uh-huh	3258	A
yeah i i'd say it's it's uh probably eighty percent dresses	3258	A
and uh once in a while we wear the pants	3258	A
but not too often	3258	A
yeah	3258	A
yeah	3258	A
i know this matches i'm not going to have to think about this	3258	A
it's the truth	3258	A
oh yeah	3258	A
but i just started the job a few months ago they just opened up um the new office that i'm working at	3258	A
and since we are located you know they located it in Dallas	3258	A
yeah i live in Plano	3258	A
but they have it down on Hillcrest and uh LBJ	3258	A
oh the uh okay yeah	3258	A
okay	3258	A
yeah i haven't- i haven't gone into downtown too much	3258	A
yeah	3258	A
yeah i just	3258	A
yeah my brother works down there in the building where the Kennedy uh book or the library is	3258	A
yes and uh he it's tough	3258	A
oh you're kidding	3258	A
oh wow	3258	A
uh-huh	3258	A
hum	3258	A
into the building	3258	A
wow	3258	A
yeah i haven't you know i- i just haven't gone down there so you know it's pretty you	3258	A
it's like where i'm from here	3258	A
you know in South Dakota it wasn't a real population- population- like Dallas has as many people as we did in our whole state	3258	A
a little different but i really like it here so	3258	A
yeah- yeah i really enjoy it i you know we we both graduated my husband and i both graduated from college	3258	A
and decided to move here	3258	A
um-hum	3258	A
he'd like to get his Master's at UTD	3258	A
and he liked that school so we come here for him to start that and and he has a Spanish you know degree so for him to use that we had to get somewhere where that was useful	3258	A
yeah	3258	A
-okay have you seen any good movies lately	3243	B
what have you seen lately	3243	B
oh uh-huh yeah that was a good movie we saw that one too	3243	B
uh in fact i can't wait to see it again it should be be in release pretty soon i think	3243	B
oh you haven't	3243	B
yeah we are being recorded	3243	B
so uh let's see i guess the only ones i've seen recently have been i saw Naked Gun Two and a Half	3243	B
that was that was pretty good that was enjoyable	3243	B
i i didn't think it was quite as good as the first one	3243	B
yeah	3243	B
it was it was pretty clever	3243	B
and then we saw	3243	B
the one that was the kind of the spoof of Top Gun	3243	B
there was they were kind of along the same lines but i i didn't enjoy that one near as much i didn't it wasn't as well done i don't think	3243	B
but uh and i'm trying to remember we've seen some other goods ones but uh and and then Silence of the Lambs that one kept me thinking for a month	3243	B
yeah	3243	B
it was interesting because the person i thought that that really you know stole the show was Anthony Hopkins	3243	B
and he was so good in that	3243	B
no i didn't	3243	B
yeah it's it's amazing how because_1 i mean realistically he wasn't in that movie but you know twenty minutes	3243	B
and yet you know he just captivated	3243	B
it it was amazing it really was	3243	B
right i it know but he is the one that kept you thinking throughout the whole movie	3243	B
and uh -that that was that was really a good movie i really enjoyed that one	3243	B
uh we haven't seen that one yet yeah i i haven't mustered up enough strength to go sit through a three hour movie	3243	B
so i i	3243	B
i run out of patience on a movie like that i start checking my watch about an hour and half	3243	B
yeah hm	3243	B
really i've heard i've heard it's really good i haven't gone to see it probably be out on tape before long too	3243	B
is it	3243	B
oh	3243	B
oh i see	3243	B
no	3243	B
me neither	3243	B
Kevin Costner yeah the Kevin Costner movie is that what you are talking about yeah yeah i really like him i have- somehow that movie never grabbed me you know as one that i would really like to see but uh	3243	B
did they pan it pretty bad or	3243	B
um-hum	3243	B
hm	3243	B
oh	3243	B
something i saw on Showtime or something the other night the i hadn't hadn't seen in a while was uh was The Hunt for Red October did you see that	3243	B
yeah me too i'm the same way and that that's really an intriguing movie too	3243	B
there there are several like that uh another one i saw that me and my wife really talked about after it was over was uh Sex Lies and Videotape	3243	B
did you see that	3243	B
bits and pieces of it	3243	B
it wasn't bad the thing was you know it was interesting the way the their lives intertwined and and and then at the end they all kind of fell apart and you know there are a lot of things to talk about after that you know because it was real interesting	3243	B
the interpersonal relationship and stuff	3243	B
so it it was a movie that we you know we end up when when you first leave there it's like you know i don't know if i like that movie but then as we get to talk about it its like all these different things that deal with these people or whatever	3243	B
no not not at all if that's what is sounds like	3243	B
but it's not that at all uh it just it talks about	3243	B
it it's basically only got four people in the whole movie and uh you know the whole the whole thing just revolves around them and you know uh really i mean	3243	B
uh um uh let's see	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
uh Dances With Wolves we just saw that kind of late	3243	A
what else have i seen	3243	A
uh	3243	A
Silence of the Lambs	3243	A
that was- that was uh spine tingling	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
yeap are are we being are we doing are we recording i've not done this before	3243	A
no	3243	A
okay	3243	A
um-hum how was that	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
yeah my son- my teenage son liked it so i wasn't quite sure how to take that whether i would whether i would like it our not	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
um-hum	3243	A
um-hum	3243	A
yeah that was uh almost to uh	3243	A
to spine tingling for me i i liked it but it was uh	3243	A
yeah it was	3243	A
oh yeah	3243	A
yeah he definitely he definitely did i saw him in uh did you see him when he played uh Adolf Hitler	3243	A
oh boy that was uh	3243	A
he also i mean- he he was outstanding act too	3243	A
uh	3243	A
uh-huh	3243	A
yeap	3243	A
yeah you're right uh you don't think uh he was so dominating- dominating you don't think about it but he was on screen not not any where near as long as	3243	A
yep yep	3243	A
yep how did you like Dances With Wolves did you like that one	3243	A
oh you haven't	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
is that right yeah	3243	A
well it kept me uh i it kept me uh interested the whole time yeah	3243	A
yeah it's out	3243	A
yeah yeah we didn't see it at the theater we waited till it came out too	3243	A
how about_1 Robin Hood have you seen that one me neither	3243	A
um i really want to see that one it's and it about to come out in on uh	3243	A
on	3243	A
huh	3243	A
yeah yeah	3243	A
uh-huh	3243	A
it did it uh well- really interested me until the reviews started coming out and they were sort of um	3243	A
no they it it um they said uh that he was	3243	A
um he's- he's performance was only average	3243	A
and um	3243	A
and and i read i read some interviews with him that he was the production was rushed so much that he didn't he evidently he studies his uh his parts real in depth	3243	A
and uh at least that's what the article said and and it was rushing the production he and he he was in intention to master a British accent for it and he didn't have time to do that	3243	A
and then they said there were some wholes in the story line too	3243	A
so	3243	A
yeah i like that one i've seen i've seen that i saw it about i saw it once at the movie and i've seen it about four times on cable	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
yeah that's a good one	3243	A
oh yeah no i've only seen uh like uh	3243	A
yeah i was traveling and and you know it was in the hotel and i you know i saw little bits and pieces of it was that was that was that any good or was it just exploit	3243	A
um-hum	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
um-hum	3243	A
so it wasn't an exploitation film uh	3243	A
yeah	3243	A
uh-huh	3243	A
well that's a good question we just got in from looking at cars and we've probably been looking at them_1 for a couple months and we haven't bought one yet so that almost answers the question how about_1 you	3277	B
oh	3277	B
uh-huh	3277	B
yeah	3277	B
um-hum	3277	B
well we we've been looking at just about everything i guess because we really don't need a car we just sort of want the luxury of buying a new car and um	3277	B
i don't know we were today we were looking at Lexuses and we keep going back to Cadillacs	3277	B
and looking at those and then you don't know if you wanna spend thirty thousand dollars and buy a new car or whether you wanna buy uh like a ninety one Cadillac a ninety or ninety one for you know twenty or nineteen or fifteen you can get them	3277	B
fairly cheap compared to buying a brand new one and the new Lexus that that they have that you you pay sticker price for those	3277	B
yes yes we we were we were all in them_1 today but you know when it comes to oops	3277	B
you know do you wanna spend about thirty thousand dollars and uh it'd probably be a little over that with the tax so that's that's really where	3277	B
where we are or should we just buy you know a little Volkswagen we've right we've you know the one of those Cabriolets i guess they're called uh it's a convertible it's sort of like you know square in the back	3277	B
but the the selling point i guess that that i or it has to pass my test i'm i'm short and i need to sit in the seat see if i can get the seat high enough to see over the steering wheel like i like to see	3277	B
yeah i'm about_1 five two	3277	B
and to make sure the seat belt doesn't hit me in the neck that it comes really over the shoulder and not up around your neck so	3277	B
right well it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts are gonna work that way nor can i get all the seats up high enough	3277	B
to do that so uh so on those we just we just forget about	3277	B
and we've been looking at cars with leather seats but uh	3277	B
i don't know this is a new experience for us just- just mainly because my uh my mother had died which meant that we were coming into some money that we could	3277	B
splurge and buy a car but but yet it's difficult to do though when you're not used to it so that's why we're we're out uh	3277	B
sort of doing this and uh	3277	B
yeah	3277	B
well we've always bought used cars before and they haven't been very expensive um so this is just just a new	3277	B
a new thing you know we've had vans we've had a new van and you know some other another new car that that wasn't used but the prices are what	3277	B
used to buy a house for	3277	B
um-hum i bet	3277	B
um-hum	3277	B
right it's hard to adjust to it and and you just don't want to really	3277	B
um-hum	3277	B
that's right- uh-huh	3277	B
well i hope you enjoy your car uh we we looked at Thunderbirds um i guess maybe about a couple weeks ago we seem to do this every	3277	B
yeah	3277	B
but it would be- it would be nice our son works for EDS and and we could use his um	3277	B
discount that he gets through General Motors	3277	B
except uh	3277	B
Cadillacs that we're looking would- would be looking at to begin with so	3277	B
yes Plano	3277	B
um-hum	3277	B
yeah we were just got back from there yeah that was our last stop about- you know about eight thirty i said oh we can always swing around Crest so there we go and we're swinging around yes we've gotten two cars two used cars from Crest	3277	B
uh what kind of car would you uh buy next	3277	A
oh you have okay	3277	A
oh and you haven't	3277	A
um we just bought one um we bought one about a month ago it was a ninety one Ford Thunderbird	3277	A
um we really liked it because um we just moved here from South Dakota and we have we do some- quite a bit of traveling	3277	A
and that was a nice car to travel in but we have also a Ford Probe and that's better to get around town in because the Thunderbird takes a lot of gas	3277	A
but um the reason we're stuck on Fords i guess is because_1 i used to sell Fords and so we're kind of stuck on that kind of a car but	3277	A
i really like um that kind of car myself but	3277	A
yeah	3277	A
oh do you	3277	A
yeah	3277	A
um-hum	3277	A
yeah	3277	A
a Lexus	3277	A
yeah	3277	A
uh-huh and isn't that neat though that is a neat car don't you think	3277	A
were you	3277	A
right	3277	A
oh i know	3277	A
yeah and get around town	3277	A
uh-huh yeah i like those	3277	A
are you shorter	3277	A
are you oh then that's yeah	3277	A
yeah it's got to be a comfortable car	3277	A
right	3277	A
uh-huh	3277	A
yeah that certainly helps	3277	A
uh-huh	3277	A
yeah	3277	A
oh and isn't that nice	3277	A
yeah	3277	A
yeah buying a car is hard you never know for sure if you're getting a good deal	3277	A
um-hum	3277	A
uh-huh	3277	A
yeah oh i know because_1 we came down here and you know and well you know from down here it but price of housing is a lot different	3277	A
but the but the price of our house up in Aberdeen was as much as some cars and it's like you know oh my goodness	3277	A
no because_1 it's like this thing it moves- moves and could be wrecked and that's like we you know get a house for this and uh it just blows our mind um but	3277	A
oh yeah	3277	A
uh-huh	3277	A
um-hum	3277	A
yeah	3277	A
that's right interest	3277	A
yeah well that's great you know because you might as well get what you want you know	3277	A
oh really	3277	A
yes that's right	3277	A
uh-huh	3277	A
uh-huh are you in Dallas	3277	A
yeah so am i are you looking at the Crest or Crest-	3277	A
you did	3277	A
uh-huh	3277	A
and we got our i	3277	A
oh you and good	3277	A
what what do you feel is the the major change that's been going on	3235	A
i think that has been the major change is that	3235	A
women feel they need to go out and do this they they no longer feel it's um it's no big deal to to stay home and raise your family anymore	3235	A
i know it and i- i think i think that's really sad because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else	3235	A
but i- i can't i can't help but think that	3235	A
eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
oh yeah that's yeah it it's sad	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
uh-huh yeah i i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary	3235	A
uh you know to i- i don't think you know the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and and and this type of thing i think that they would from the you know attention or whatever	3235	A
uh but i- i uh i	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
what what grade do you teach	3235	A
six seven and eight i've got a child- uh where do you live are you out	3235	A
in Richardson we're in Plano here and i have a daughter in middle school and uh i know there aren't very many but she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home but do you see	3235	A
um you know do you ever- do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are are left alone too much and	3235	A
he stays at school and the school allows that	3235	A
uh-huh	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
oh my	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
oh	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
no mother to talk to	3235	A
well i've do you do you feel it will swing back the other way or do you feel there's just going to be a big push to uh you know for for more more and more day care type situations	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
um-hum	3235	A
yeah	3235	A
that's a tough question we're now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework right	3235	B
don't ask me	3235	B
well it has no credibility anymore	3235	B
well i'm a school teacher and i'm in charge of raising them so i can appreciate it	3235	B
oh good for you good for you	3235	B
well you know it's interesting because_1 when i heard the topic i was thinking uh this summer Oprah had a TV show	3235	B
about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible	3235	B
and one woman had four children	3235	B
and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family and that's frightening	3235	B
and it's you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a	3235	B
social issue	3235	B
yeah people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them_1	3235	B
and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them	3235	B
that's true	3235	B
that's true	3235	B
yeah well you know i as i said i teach school and	3235	B
gosh i'm trying to think i don't know i have one woman	3235	B
one mother that i know is home	3235	B
but she also has ten children	3235	B
six seven and eight	3235	B
in Richardson	3235	B
oh okay	3235	B
oh yes	3235	B
yeah i've got one child um that stays with me everyday till five because_1 his mother doesn't come home until seven and he doesn't wanna to be home from three thirty to seven by himself	3235	B
um-hum	3235	B
well he stays with me and i have a tendency to work late i work till six	3235	B
so he stays with me till five thirty and then goes home	3235	B
and you know i have lots of kids because_1 they know i'm there late i'm a slow mover to say the least but um they'll come in and say can i stay with you because i don't wanna go home to an empty house	3235	B
and that's frightening because_1 you know the when i said i i'm i'm raising them i am because_1 we're talking about boyfriends and we're talking about	3235	B
what the girl said in class and you know what's right because there's no mother at home to do it	3235	B
and um	3235	B
it makes a difference i've and just the social values	3235	B
i- i don't know	3235	B
i- i have a feeling we're gonna go more and more i've got a twenty one year old	3235	B
female and i've got twenty two year old male	3235	B
children- child children and	3235	B
i listen to my daughter and she's going to work and she's going to buy her house and she's gonna get her car and then she's gonna have her children	3235	B
and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their lifestyle is	3235	B
and they back to work and you know i agree with you i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things	3235	B
and we live without them_1 we did fine	3235	B
uh i live in Richardson	3264	B
okay	3264	B
um uh rock and roll	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
i'm i'm twenty one so i'm in the the new kind of rock and roll stuff	3264	B
yes	3264	B
okay	3264	B
oh	3264	B
um i- i took a uh recording engineering class out in Irving with a guy named Phil York	3264	B
so i know how to run a sound room and everything like that	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
oh i did a band project for the class itself and then i haven't been able to get anything with it since	3264	B
i have some friends with bands and they don't even bother to ask me	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
that's when you find out who your friends are i guess	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah my i uh i think i took for about four years when i was younger and i don't remember how old i was	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah i had fun with it	3264	B
as as long as it wasn't too dull and boring	3264	B
yeah the simpler stuff was a little more boring but	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
i think that's what	3264	B
i think that's what happened to me	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
basically all that's left is to stick the music in front of them_1 and let them play	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
my my mom took piano for thirteen years when she was younger yeah she still plays once in a while	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
she does the Mozart- Mozart and Chopin and Beethoven stuff she sits down and plays all that the hard stuff that i never got around to	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah now i now i play guitar	3264	B
yes	3264	B
electric uh rhythm	3264	B
i i've never had formal lessons i just would sit down and listen to the music and figure it out how to play it	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah uh the the only other problem i have with it is that i've never learned how to learn the the notes for guitar	3264	B
in other words where the fingers would go for the different notes and everything	3264	B
and so when if i ever have a conversation with somebody else that plays guitar they start naming off notes and i go whoa you lost me stop	3264	B
i and so i can't read tabulates or anything else like that that go along with it so i just have to listen to the music and	3264	B
you know pick it out	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
yeah yeah	3264	B
makes- makes it easier whenever somebody is trying to teach you a song you just go show me where it goes and i'll do it	3264	B
rather than them going play an A play an E play a B	3264	B
oh i- i listen to the the more heavier rock uh Kiss White Snake Scorpions stuff like that	3264	B
well they so the rest of them_1 came out let's see	3264	B
about_1 two years ago	3264	B
they	3264	B
right uh they took off their makeup back their it's my favorite group that's why i know a lot about them um they took off their makeup in eighty i believe it was	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
they had they had five or six albums since they took off their makeup but	3264	B
uh Smashes and Thrashes and Hits yeah	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
fight them_1	3264	B
fight them_1 all the way	3264	B
yeah i'm i'm not either uh my my dad listens to it and it just it drives me up a wall	3264	B
yeah	3264	B
Mark where where do you live	3264	A
oh do you okay i'm in Plano	3264	A
okay uh what kind of music do you like	3264	A
rock and roll	3264	A
me too	3264	A
that's pretty much	3264	A
what i listen to	3264	A
oh you're twenty one okay i'm twenty three	3264	A
so not much difference	3264	A
yeah i was a music minor in college	3264	A
so	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
well that's neat	3264	A
that's neat	3264	A
have you ever recorded anything or	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
oh really	3264	A
oh	3264	A
yeah you do	3264	A
oh that would- that is neat i like that i've always wanted to be in a band but	3264	A
we just moved here in June and	3264	A
i haven't been able to get settled that much yet but	3264	A
i- i- i played piano for about sixteen years so	3264	A
really did you like it	3264	A
like Mary had a Little Lamb	3264	A
yeah i had i taught for a while and	3264	A
and the kids just	3264	A
they just didn't you know after they got to a certain point they gave up	3264	A
you know and- and they tell you if you can't keep it interesting then	3264	A
yeah they're they're you know it's just kind of stuff because_1 after you go to a certain point there's you don't feel like there's much more you can do	3264	A
but	3264	A
right because_1 they'll do the rest on their own	3264	A
because_1 they know the notes now it's just they have to do it themselves but	3264	A
yeah	3264	A
really	3264	A
i bet she's good	3264	A
yeah	3264	A
yeah	3264	A
yeah	3264	A
yeah uh	3264	A
we had to give concerts and all that in college	3264	A
with our majors so	3264	A
well it's it's tough not bad	3264	A
you do um bass guitar or	3264	A
electric	3264	A
oh okay yeah i would that's one thing i never learned to play and i wish i would have is guitar	3264	A
really	3264	A
that's great	3264	A
i wish i had an ear like that because_1 i can sight read	3264	A
but i can't ear any i can't hear or i can't	3264	A
you know listen to something and play it	3264	A
that's real tough for me	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
oh just sing it to me	3264	A
oh	3264	A
well that that's good though because_1 then you can hear something and play it instead of waiting for the music and	3264	A
yeah that would be good and that's even better for bands even i think	3264	A
to be able to do that	3264	A
yeah that's neat	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
yeah that that is good i like that	3264	A
so like um what bands do you listen to	3264	A
yeah	3264	A
yeah	3264	A
um i like Kiss but they haven't been out too long i mean they haven't done anything recently	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
yeah	3264	A
and that was the one they came out without the makeup and they haven't been with makeup for quite a while have they	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
in eighty	3264	A
yeah that was something you know	3264	A
yeah i- i have the one and i can't remember what the name is now but they put all the um	3264	A
it was one of their um best hits	3264	A
yes	3264	A
that's it and i just love that tape that is great	3264	A
but now they're trying to convert me because_1 i just moved here from South Dakota and uh they're trying to convert me to Country and i am just not i Country person	3264	A
yeah i'm just not a Country Western person	3264	A
uh-huh	3264	A
yeah i'm that's one thing i'd you would think in a in a Midwest that you would but i	3264	A
i never grew up that way so	3264	A
well i've been real um thinking i'd love to buy a new car right now if i could afford it but we have two cars right now and we're still paying on but i would love to have one of these new minivans	3265	A
i've got two little ones and i think that would be just the perfect family car	3265	A
oh	3265	A
well what is it	3265	A
oh	3265	A
yeah we have um	3265	A
we have we went out to buy an American car so we bought um a Chevy Nova about three years ago and then we opened up the the hood and it said Toyota	3265	A
made in Japan right across the front of all the engine parts	3265	A
um-hum Toyota uh well the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry uh at that time	3265	A
was the same car so they just put different names on them_1 depending on who they're being shipped to i thought that was pretty insensitive-	3265	A
yeah	3265	A
um-hum um-hum that's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written i mean imprinted on the engine it was real interesting	3265	A
but uh i with so many options now available you know where where cars are concerned it just seems like there is	3265	A
there's almost too much of a choice anymore you know that there's	3265	A
so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever i think that if i were	3265	A
really serious about looking for another car i would take into consideration the price naturally but um	3265	A
you know i would really want something that i would want for that much money for ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever	3265	A
oh yeah definitely	3265	A
i cannot imagine that you know somebody i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollars car	3265	A
about oh oh it would how exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase and i thought i don't think i'd find that exciting i'd be wondering you know here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money	3265	A
that's true	3265	A
yeah	3265	A
yeah well we got a pretty we bought our Chevrolet brand new and then we bought a used car <b_aside> just a minute i'll change your diaper <e_aside> the we bought our our next car used	3265	A
and uh we had better luck with our used car and i like it more it cost us less money and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for	3265	A
twice as much money	3265	A
if you can find one that's reliable- uh you know reliable if you can get someone that you trust to buy one from or you know make sure that you can have it checked out well enough	3265	A
uh i wouldn't	3265	A
yeah	3265	A
that's we bought one like that	3265	A
uh-huh we bought one car that way and had we bought it real reasonably and it was in real nice condition so because_1 apparently whatever the bank get	3265	A
i right now my car is terminally ill so i am really looking at uh facing the purchase of a car	3265	B
and uh what i would like to have is so totally impractical for me that i won't do it uh well i would like for one time in my life to have a convertible	3265	B
and uh you know i don't even like the wind blowing on me so i don't know why i think i want one but i do	3265	B
uh i will probably stay with a foreign make i've had real good luck with them	3265	B
is that right	3265	B
oh well- i didn't realize it i knew that one of the	3265	B
that Nissan which is Toyota had uh joined with	3265	B
had a plant over here and and i didn't know if it was General Motors or who	3265	B
but i- i never thought of	3265	B
i don't know uh you think of Chevrolet and the good old USA	3265	B
huh	3265	B
uh well yeah and that's minimum	3265	B
it you know it's it's a major purchase now what we used to pay for homes	3265	B
is now what a car can cost	3265	B
if they held their value that would be one thing but when you consider that when you drive them_1 off of the show lot they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated	3265	B
and you know that	3265	B
i don't know that i'll go with i've bought a new car the last three that i've bought and i don't know that i'll buy a brand new one again	3265	B
well i'm i'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car	3265	B
well some people you know some people have to have a new car every year	3265	B
or it you know at the most every two years and they don't drive them_1 that much	3265	B
especially your foreign cars	3265	B
yeah like a Honda or uh a Toyota fifty thousand is just getting broken in for them	3265	B
and if i can find one or a repossession	3265	B
and with the banks being in such financial you know problems now that people you can find the banks willing to sell you a car	3265	B
to uh like some easy listening i have the Edge on there	3295	B
um New Wave oh Dallas	3295	B
where are you from	3295	B
okay then you wouldn't know what the Edge is it's kind of like new not punk or anything but just new age- New Wave or whatever how about you	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
like New Age	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B

um-hum you probably know a lot more about music than i do i just listen to it while i'm driving basically uh i don't even have a stereo at the moment	3295	B
so uh-huh	3295	B
um-hum it's pretty hard	3295	B
um	3295	B
but soul you know i like everybody um don't die but i like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer and um um the Jacksons Michael	3295	B
Terrance	3295	B
Terence Trent D'Arby uh	3295	B
just everybody yeah i like him except for his latest song Cream i could live without	3295	B

hm	3295	B
hm	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
yeah he's always been kind of a pervert	3295	B
which is weird because it's like on one hand he's so religious and then on the other hand he's such a big pervert you know kind of ironic	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
um-hum um-hum that's true	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
they abuse their power	3295	B
hm	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
hm	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
hm	3295	B
hm	3295	B
how old are you	3295	B
how old are you	3295	B

hm	3295	B
what's your major	3295	B
oh	3295	B
i was thinking English or something	3295	B
hm	3295	B
hm	3295	B
um-hum	3295	B
oh neat	3295	B
hm	3295	B

um-hum	3295	B
where where'd you go to school	3295	B
hm	3295	B

so no wonder you know so much about music	3295	B
um-hum oh it really doesn't matter to tell you the truth	3295	B
so what kind of music do you like	3295	A
yeah	3295	A
um-hum uh where do you live	3295	A
okay i'm from Pennsylvania	3295	A
right exactly	3295	A
okay	3295	A
um well i like a lot of folk music and jazz and different sorts of experimental music	3295	A
um yeah some stuff that you could call New Age let's see i like uh Cherry Riley a lot	3295	A
and okay uh let's see well who do you like from that category yeah say	3295	A
uh New Wave all right okay well who do you like like that i mean	3295	A
uh-huh	3295	A
okay	3295	A
yeah i'm not i'm not that crazy about the Bauhaus um i liked Joy Division a lot and	3295	A
oh oh maybe right	3295	A
um-hum	3295	A
oh how horrible how how can you live like that um	3295	A
right um let's see and	3295	A
um-hum	3295	A
right	3295	A
okay	3295	A
um-hum yes i think	3295	A
right least the Jacksons i can agree with you	3295	A
uh	3295	A
um-hum yeah you like stuff like Prince	3295	A
and	3295	A
his what	3295	A
okay uh let's see yeah i think i heard that	3295	A
once i like what i've heard of the new album	3295	A
his uh	3295	A
uh like what	3295	A
um-hum	3295	A
yeah well that's very good have you heard uh Dirty Mind	3295	A
oh that's a that's a fantastic album it's even	3295	A
earlier it's one of those where he's playing all the instruments and it's uh actually pretty brilliant a lot of it's uh like the dirty side of his stuff	3295	A
but that's all right too	3295	A
um-hum	3295	A
right well	3295	A
yeah well i think that kind of happens for	3295	A
a lot of artists i mean you could say the same sort of thing about	3295	A
Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis or something or well Jimmy Swaggert he's in he's a singer	3295	A
uh right uh and no it seems that a lot of people a lot of Christians seem to sort of walk the line between uh	3295	A
you know total depravity and	3295	A
you know and religion and asceticism you know	3295	A
what	3295	A
i'm twenty uh uh six	3295	A
yeah	3295	A
uh oh well	3295	A
um	3295	A
acoustics	3295	A
right	3295	A
okay yeah no i'm in engineering basically	3295	A
but i'm very interested in music anyway i play some stuff and i'm a radio DJ and blah blah blah	3295	A
um	3295	A
well just	3295	A
i worked for a radio station as an undergraduate just the college radio station and had	3295	A
had to Goshen College which is in Indiana	3295	A
and i found it	3295	A
to be a very	3295	A
good experience i mean besides having access to millions of records i liked being able to control the airwaves you know	3295	A
and so now i'm just working for the campus radio station at Penn State where i am	3295	A
okay oh well um let's see we're really supposed to talk about that then um	3295	A
yeah i- i watch a lot of television myself here lately i'm out of a job right now so	3292	B
watch a lot of lot of Jeopardy and cartoons	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
um i like uh the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air	3292	B
and uh generally the the channel eight stuff that comes on Doogie Howser and Roseanne and	3292	B
stuff like that	3292	B
a real favorite	3292	B
probably Fresh Prince or Married With Children	3292	B
uh excuse me	3292	B
yeah i- i watch that when i can usually i- i go out right around then so i'm not home then	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
um-hum	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
uh yes i am actually i it's the first year i've really been interested- interested in baseball but i just- decided to pay attention here to the the World Series	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
that's getting tickets for something like that it's like trying to	3292	B
i don't know enter Fort Knox	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
that's kind of strange	3292	B
yeah and now and now Dynasty is again tonight and the World Series is back on again tonight	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
i think what it is is everybody	3292	B
excuse me everybody was looking to see the the fight between the the two women	3292	B
that's a a friend of mine was taping it just so he could see this one fight and he taped the wrong day because_1 it wasn't on the first day	3292	B
so now he's got to tape tape it again today i think's when it comes back on	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
i- i never was much of a Dynasty fan	3292	B
yeah	3292	B
okay	3292	B
okay	3292	B
thank you bye	3292	B
this is an easy- easy subject i- i guess i watch too much TV that's	3292	A
do you afternoon shows mainly then	3292	A
yeah my kids love to watch cartoons and i have to come in the other bedroom to watch Jeopardy and and such what are some of your favorite sitcoms or whatever at night	3292	A
yeah pretty good	3292	A
um-hum	3292	A
um-hum	3292	A
you don't have a real favorite or	3292	A
they're your favorites huh they're pretty good oh it surprises me that yours aren't the same as mine and i thought i formed mine kind of with my husband so we've been MacGyver fans forever	3292	A
and- i don't know if you ever watch that it's on Monday nights	3292	A
and we	3292	A
we enjoy it mainly because it i think it has it's full of adventure and stuff like that	3292	A
yeah and we used to like Cosby real well but it it's kind of slacked off a little bit it's not one of our	3292	A
but uh we we watch and LA Law is another one we probably watch if we can	3292	A
and Quantum Leap we have our our favorites of course i don't know what channel they're all on probably different ones	3292	A
that's kind of fun to watch too are you watching the World Series right now too or	3292	A
i have a brother that lives in Minnesota so this- kind of been fun to watch and	3292	A
they tried to get get tickets and man the scalpers that were out wanted a hundred and fifty per ticket	3292	A
yeah so- i just read in today's paper where the Dynasty sequel um out rated the World Series that really surprised me	3292	A
it will be interesting to see how many keep with it	3292	A
yeah	3292	A
yeah they look like that's pretty good	3292	A
i think i'll stick with the World Series let them fight it out i don't-	3292	A
no i- i watched Dallas at first- when it first came on and then i lost interest in it too	3292	A
and Dynasty i just never did get into so but well i think that's all we need to discuss we have a few similar not too many and	3292	A
now i'll have to watch one of yours and see if i like it so all right it was good talking to you bye-bye	3292	A
okay so you're into microwave cooking	3225	A
and that- yes and that's what we all are looking for isn't it something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work	3225	A
i've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends	3225	A
so that i have leftovers all week	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
i know i try not to make too much it's just my husband and i too and i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week but uh i usually i usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or you know something like that or sometimes a roast but	3225	A
what's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party	3225	A
oh	3225	A
uh-huh	3225	A
ooh that sounds delicious	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
we i end up with an old standby that we call Russian chicken because it's so easy	3225	A
and uh it goes- you have to cook very little to go with it just some rice and some salad and that's about it you know	3225	A
uh you make you just take your boneless chicken breasts and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh Russian dressing one bottle of that	3225	A
and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix	3225	A
and three ounces of apricot preserves	3225	A
and you mix it up and you just put it on the top of the chicken and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour	3225	A
and then i take the foil off and let it brown	3225	A
takes about another twenty minutes	3225	A
and it's delicious	3225	A
and it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business and by the time i've got everything else ready the chicken's ready- chicken's done	3225	A
so that's a real easy thing for me	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
oh really	3225	A
no i don't my mom gets that but	3225	A
really	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
hm	3225	A
hm	3225	A
oh my goodness	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
well i love cheesecake i have never been i don't know the ones i have made i have not done that well with	3225	A
i like a baked cheesecake you know i don't i've had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it you know but that's not the same as a a New York style cheesecake	3225	A
and uh the recipes that i've used everybody will say oh this is real simple and then i make it and it's it's really not very good	3225	A
but yours sounds good i bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness	3225	A
hm well that sounds interesting so there's your good dessert for your dinner party	3225	A
are you into serving wines with your dinner party	3225	A
me either i wish i knew more about it	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
they would be if you just had time to do it	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
well how neat	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
hm well i didn't even know they were offering that i guess i	3225	A
um-hum	3225	A
oh well i bet that'd be a fun thing to do	3225	A
yeah it's just it's so easy nowadays you know and it's uh especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave and it be ready in just a few minutes	3225	B
yeah	3225	B
all week well we've done that too there's just my husband and i and he he sometimes makes a huge spot of- uh pot of spaghetti and we	3225	B
uh-huh	3225	B
yeah	3225	B
right	3225	B
right	3225	B
um i have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas	3225	B
it's it's really good i got it from a friend of mine that i used to work with and uh every time i've served it everybody just loves it	3225	B
so that's that's one of my favorite things to make what about you	3225	B
um-hum	3225	B
uh-huh well what do you put in it	3225	B
uh-huh	3225	B
um-hum	3225	B
ooh that sounds good	3225	B
uh-huh	3225	B
uh-huh	3225	B
uh-huh	3225	B
ooh that sounds good	3225	B
is done right	3225	B
yeah that sounds good too	3225	B
i've got a um a great recipe for cheesecake	3225	B
i don't know if you get Southern Living that magazine	3225	B
they have one- if you like to cook they have every recipe i've tried out of that has been a really good one	3225	B
and um you know every month they've got all different kinds of recipes but	3225	B
i got one in there about a year or so ago on cheesecake and it's just a regular cheesecake and then you can put raspberry um topping on it but inside the cheesecake uh recipe you put um	3225	B
lemon peel and orange peel	3225	B
and it's just enough to taste it you know when when when you're eating the cheesecake and it is wonderful but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for	3225	B
and then you're supposed to um i think chill it to room temperature	3225	B
so sometimes i'll do that overnight and then put the topping on the next day but it's it's very good	3225	B
um-hum	3225	B
uh-huh	3225	B
right yeah	3225	B
no- no	3225	B
it's not	3225	B
right	3225	B
it does and it it it is really good	3225	B
it is it is pretty good	3225	B
right	3225	B
oh sometimes but i mean i'm not a wine connoisseur by any means	3225	B
i've been to you know some wine tastings up in Napa Valley but um	3225	B
you know and i learned a little bit about them_1 then but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take	3225	B
and-	3225	B
yeah and then there's places um do you live in Dallas okay there's places here that um	3225	B
offer i think it's like once a month you can go and to a particular restaurant or whatever and you can kind of take a cooking class	3225	B
and then you get to eat everything afterwards and then they also go into the wines you know to serve with you know different types of of meals and that kind of thing and it sounds like it's a lot of fun we have some friends who've done that and they've really enjoyed it	3225	B
yeah this place is called like Medina's or Mesina's Kitchen or something like that	3225	B
yeah it it sounds like like it	3225	B
right	3283	B
i am very much for capital punishment	3283	B
my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus and i've been raised around	3283	B
prison	3283	B
prisons all my life and i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent	3283	B
that's right	3283	B
especially not a federal prison	3283	B
well see we were under uh the state prisons were under a mandate to	3283	B
uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go	3283	B
and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let	3283	B
loose under early bail you know or early uh out but uh we have	3283	B
the death penalty is not given often	3283	B
but there have been	3283	B
and you know i maybe it should be	3283	B
uh	3283	B
well it should be given you know i i won't say sparingly but i do believe it should be befitting the crime	3283	B
right course you know they're they're entitled to a speedy trial	3283	B
but then they're they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals so somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much	3283	B
and it seems even though you know that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey i'm tired i just want out	3283	B
you know i'm tired of fighting it then the system just keeps on	3283	B
and at that point you know i- i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter	3283	B
appeal process	3283	B
well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system	3283	B
uh it doesn't it doesn't help them_1 any at all and course your court system when you get into the appeals	3283	B
i don't believe criminal is in a court by itself	3283	B
and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there	3283	B
we've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life	3283	B
well i just	3283	B
i just feel like their	3283	B
crime and punishment and	3283	B
if if you don't have the punishment	3283	B
you double your crime and that- you know that is just personal feeling it's not going on facts	3283	B
i think the facts would probably back it up but	3283	B
what	3283	B
well yes i	3283	B
okay we're talking about capital punishment	3283	A
how do you feel about that Lenore	3283	A
well wonderful i am too one hundred percent	3283	A
um-hum	3283	A
all your life huh uh-huh	3283	A
there's no deterrent	3283	A
that's right there's just no deterrent	3283	A
and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them_1 that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think	3283	A
right well i don't know what the Oklahoma's laws are but Texas is i don't know our	3283	A
i don't know it's it's no ones fault- i mean it's not the judges fault i don't think it's just the way the law is down here	3283	A
man our crimes- our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two	3283	A
well that's what ours did same thing	3283	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3283	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3283	A
um-hum	3283	A
it's not here either really	3283	A
i do too and and you know but the way the courts are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal but i think that- i think it needs to be expedited you know if they've been convicted and given them_1 appeal	3283	A
and they're still convicted of of a crime that's deserving of of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it	3283	A
that's right	3283	A
um-hum um-hum	3283	A
yeah	3283	A
that's right somehow it just doesn't it works and then again it takes too long for it to work	3283	A
um-hum	3283	A
um-hum	3283	A
um-hum yeah	3283	A
yeah it it was-	3283	A
i do too i think that needs to and i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably but you know	3283	A
yeah- that's true it is overcrowded because there's so much drug uh	3283	A
problem with the people on drugs because_1 that they with the drugs they're they're robbing and killing and uh that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think	3283	A
no it doesn't	3283	A
yeah that's true with all these lawsuits and people suing people over things- ridiculous things but	3283	A
it could be supportive it it's it's supported with facts though	3283	A
it could very easily be supported with facts	3283	A
yes	3220	B
well the last time i went to a dinner party was down at the lake and uh golly it was a dish uh from uh down in Panama	3220	B
and uh	3220	B
i think the name of it was Paella	3220	B
and uh it was a delicious meal	3220	B
well the dish was composed- was composed of uh steak and chicken and shrimp all cut up you know	3220	B
uh into uh bite size portions and it had rice in it and tomatoes and vegetables and uh	3220	B
onions and green peppers and what you do is prepare this uh in a a large uh oh it looks like a large uh uh	3220	B
garbage can uh uh lid you know only turned upside down	3220	B
and uh this particular particular- this particular person that cooked this uh cooked it over a burner propane burner course down in Panama they cook it right out right over right over an open flame	3220	B
and	3220	B
yeah Paella how'd you know oh oh you have i'll be darned	3220	B
yeah well it	3220	B
right and they omitted the squid and there's one other item too that they omitted i can't i can't recall what that was but uh	3220	B
uh we don't no we don't like squid it's too rubbery	3220	B
yeah	3220	B
but all this was cooked together they did serve French bread buttered uh bread and uh and uh it was delicious	3220	B
we had that in fact uh Saturday night of this last week	3220	B
down at Caney City	3220	B
oh it's about sixty miles this side of Tyler and uh	3220	B
and uh oh about a hundred uh let's see about seventy five miles from Dallas in between Tyler and us	3220	B
yeah is Canton is north uh uh north of us	3220	B
<b_aside> what's the name of that lake down there <e_aside>	3220	B
oh yes	3220	B
yeah it's on Cedar Creek	3220	B
yeah	3220	B
we have a lake house down there and jointly owned with another couple here in the neighborhood	3220	B
so we're always having parties and this particular time we had uh what we call our uh our our group here in uh in Richardson the uh what we're in we gather together and go out and eat at some restaurant or something of that nature	3220	B
or go to some event	3220	B
south huh	3220	B
what town	3220	B
Mobile uh-huh	3220	B
um-hum	3220	B
turnip greens with the greens too	3220	B
um-hum	3220	B
do you like highly seasoned uh highly season it	3220	B
yeah	3220	B
yeah i like to eat those green peppers just uh uh whole you know with turnip greens	3220	B
uh-huh	3220	B
well did you go to Auburn down there just off the subject	3220	B
well good did you know a Spivey down there	3220	B
yeah that went to Auburn	3220	B
uh what-	3220	B
no	3220	B

i'll be darned	3220	B
so uh you really uh like to entertain your friends uh and	3220	B
anyway	3220	A
so i'm	3220	A
so like what did you eat the last time you went to a dinner party	3220	A
uh-huh	3220	A
wow	3220	A
what was it what was the dish	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
uh-huh	3220	A
uh-huh	3220	A
uh-huh	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
it's it's Paella is what it is because_1 i've i've had that before	3220	A
yeah	3220	A
i've friends who are Cuban- who well they're Cuban and uh i was in Miami one time and they fixed that dish and they used squid in it it it had all kinds of meats and	3220	A
uh-huh	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
it's sort of like the a version-	3220	A
uh-huh	3220	A
wow	3220	A
where's that	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
oh like near Canton or	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
oh okay well i know where that is	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
well i'm having friends over this weekend	3220	A
i'm from South Alabama originally	3220	A
South Alabama way down there uh close to Mobile	3220	A
yeah Foley	3220	A
uh and anyway so what- what i one thing i like to do is i like to cook real Southern food	3220	A
and so my friends um you know whenever i cook they usually like for me to really like cook Southern food so this weekend we're i'm doing like fried chicken i'm going to fry chicken and have turnip greens	3220	A
and like a blackeyed pea salad and uh uh corn bread so i mean	3220	A
yeah actually just the with the greens not much of the turnips	3220	A
i don't like the turnip parts	3220	A
but	3220	A
so i mean it's kind of you know weird because_1 you think all your yuppie friends wouldn't necessarily want to eat like that but they do	3220	A
the turnip greens oh sometimes like with pepper sauce you mean	3220	A
well i'm i	3220	A
yeah	3220	A
i- i like seasoned food but i can it can get too much pretty quickly for me i- i think but	3220	A
yes	3220	A
i did	3220	A
a Spivey in Auburn	3220	A
no we had neighbors whose names were Spivey uh Aubrey Spivey	3220	A
they were neighbors of ours my parents live now live in Auburn my whole family my sister everyone lives in Auburn	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
oh goodness	3220	A
uh-huh	3220	A
um-hum	3220	A
well that's where i went to that's where i'm from	3220	A
but anyway	3220	A
all right	3247	B
okay what's your views on it	3247	B
correct okay well i'm for it i think there are certain crimes that definitely uh	3247	B
call for it i- i feel like that child molestation and murder i don't see any sense in	3247	B
someone living that does things like that i- i don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way and of course Texas has it but they very seldom	3247	B
you know put it into effect so instead all of our prisons are full of people on you know	3247	B
a lot of people on death row	3247	B
well uh yeah which is not very often right	3247	B
what do they do just keep them_1 on death row for the rest of their life um-hum	3247	B
uh-huh	3247	B
do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here	3247	B
i know that we have you know really in fact they're they're releasing people	3247	B
uh that are in there for you know not major crimes but uh robberies and assault and things like that and because they don't have room which then they're coming back on the streets and of course doing it again	3247	B
and um you know so we're having problems in in that way and i know that there are some cases that uh	3247	B
you know	3247	B
capital punishment does not fit the crime and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types	3247	B
um but i have to say that i'm honestly for it	3247	B
uh almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth	3247	B
yes	3247	B
i know they use it very um they do not have it in Europe as i understand	3247	B
yes you wonder what their you know how they manage to do that	3247	B
well England has uh don't they have a large uh fairly large welfare	3247	B
oh i don't- i don't know	3247	B
but we have a lot of welfare programs and if both do and they tend to have less crime you wonder if that has anything to do with it then	3247	B
you know or is it uh in our society	3247	B
people are brought up over here thinking that you know everybody owes them_1 something	3247	B
oh do you	3247	B
well that's interesting i would not have i would not have said that i would have said that it was more prevalent here	3247	B
in the United States	3247	B
that's an interesting theory i'm not that familiar	3247	B
you know i've only been over there a couple of times and i'm not that familiar with uh	3247	B
that all i know is that you know for instance we were in Germany in uh	3247	B
okay	3247	A
capital punishment	3247	A
um for myself i'm i'm personally against it but	3247	A
we seem to have a duality of	3247	A
in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it	3247	A
okay well	3247	A
uh Texas uses it as about as much as any other state	3247	A
Texas is a big state	3247	A
uh	3247	A
here in Maryland to the capital punishment law people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one no one is has actually has the sentence carried out uh i'd certainly	3247	A
um-hum i think so i there there are a lot there or a fair number uh	3247	A
in fact i think that it it affected the the sentence though capital punishment is available the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one	3247	A
and it's being being used much more	3247	A
uh i don't know the exact numbers but but yes prisons are overcrowded	3247	A
um	3247	A
okay you're you're certainly in the majority	3247	A
uh at least in this country	3247	A
uh we are i guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment	3247	A
no at least not in Western Europe probably not in Eastern Europe these days either um	3247	A
there are many reasons for it but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates	3247	A
well in part it's a uh it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogeneous society	3247	A
in many cases uh arguably if- arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits though i tend to be- we tend to be skeptical	3247	A
yes oh there's no question that- that they that uh you know they they've you know all kinds of cradle to grave uh programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way i- i- i however the question is is that making the difference	3247	A
oh	3247	A
um	3247	A
i think i think that idea is even even more common in Western Europe	3247	A
um-hum	3247	A
me too	3247	A
hello	3238	A
hi my name's Gail i'm calling from Texas	3238	A
oh what a deal	3238	A
hm took long enough to find you	3238	A
yeah seems like they take forever any more but um so did you hear what the topic was did she tell you okay	3238	A
great well if you're ready then uh i'll just go ahead and start okay hold on	3238	A
okay well i guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women	3238	A
seems like um	3238	A
to me everything is just	3238	A
changing so much that it's almost like um	3238	A
you can't keep up with things	3238	A
any more and everything is uh there everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women i personally i'm a stay home mom and i like it the way it used to be	3238	A
are you	3238	A
yeah	3238	A
um-hum	3238	A
yeah	3238	A
how- how many kids do you have two are they young or	3238	A
five and two i have two and mine are two and nine months	3238	A
so um being being home is real i- i just am fortunate because i don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home	3238	A
and uh i just it's just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning who's who's a working uh lady a working mom and	3238	A
you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs and it just seems like um she she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care	3238	A
and uh i just think i- i	3238	A
i just don't agree with that i think it should be	3238	A
that people should get back to staying home and	3238	A
and being family more family oriented than than not	3238	A
you know it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other and i hope it just doesn't get to where	3238	A
you know there's more women more and more women going into the work force	3238	A
yeah	3238	A
um-hum	3238	A
yeah well i find that i whenever i have to whenever i'm in a group of people and we're discussing things like just over the weekend i visited my family and some cousins i hadn't seen in a long time and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing	3238	A
and uh you know well i had my baby with me and i found that all i talked about was my baby which was fine with me but it's like you know here these people are they're going to school getting degrees making all this money and you know they kind of looked at me like i was	3238	A
from the dark ages you know like i because_1 i didn't have really all that much to talk about uh where career and things like that were concerned	3238	A
i mean you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while	3238	A
in social situations sometimes	3238	A
which is too bad because you know	3238	A
i- i feel like i don't obviously i don't get paid for my job but i should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home that's what i figure i'm worth a lot as for what i do	3238	A
every day	3238	A
but you know i don't know	3238	A
he's kind of a um	3238	A
at at least here i've noticed i'm not from here i'm from Colorado	3238	A
but i've really noticed that there are a lot of uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and	3238	A
at least in the circles i've traveled and in the church that i go to you know that men don't treat you like you don't know anything generally	3238	A
speaking	3238	A
yeah	3238	A
yeah	3238	A
yeah i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem	3238	A
definitely	3238	A
well-	3238	A
hello	3238	B
hi	3238	B
i'm Sandy i'm in Texas too	3238	B
oh really	3238	B
yes	3238	B
yeah	3238	B
okay	3238	B
yeah	3238	B
so am i	3238	B
i you know i think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you i mean that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before but	3238	B
i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know	3238	B
i don't know i mean i think sometimes some of the the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know and you can't have everything	3238	B
i don't i don't think that you can have i mean there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i wanna be	3238	B
and to me that's more important	3238	B
two	3238	B
um-hum	3238	B
five and two	3238	B
well i agree i mean but i- i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children aren't going to you know turn out or whatever because that's not fair to	3238	B
you know like the single moms that have to work or if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet	3238	B
not working or whatever i mean i think it's got to be a personal choice and	3238	B
it's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home	3238	B
yeah	3238	B
yeah	3238	B
yeah	3238	B
well and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff and i think that's really important	3238	B
that that they do that and they realize there's a need for that and um	3238	B
i don't know i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work and it wasn't where i had to be there every day but	3238	B
i mean we're going to the doctor once a week so i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor	3238	B
yes i do	3287	B
but uh not as much as i used to well i go you know the Y is right across from the church so i go to the YMCA and i do Nautilus i- i lift weights and i do it basically really i do it three five- three times a week	3287	B
well i did up until like when my allergies got until like August	3287	B
and my allergies got so bad because_1 i walked and um i need to like you know they have Stairmaster at the Y but i just can't seem to get myself on the Stairmaster and i don't like exercising at all	3287	B
i mean now you know now you're huh i hate it and you know thank goodness the Y is right there i mean if it took any of more effort at all i would never do it	3287	B
yeah i was gonna ask you what do you do	3287	B
uh-huh	3287	B
um-hum	3287	B
oh i like to walk too and i like to walk outside i don't like to walk inside	3287	B
to the yeah the parks and Rec place it's nice but still it's inside	3287	B
uh-huh	3287	B
um-hum	3287	B
we have to talk three minutes i think but anyway	3287	B
that's about all i would have to say about exercising anyway i do it but i don't like it and i've decided that exercise has nothing whatsoever to do with my weight it's what i eat -because- because	3287	B
yeah i don't know that that's true for me because i lost all that weight that i lost without ever exercising i had not started exercising and i lost thirty pounds but	3287	B
when i started exercising then i started eating more because i thought oh well you know now that i'm exercising and it just doesn't work you know i feel better from exercising but it doesn't really control my weight	3287	B
yeah it does	3287	B
well they say- you know like forty minutes basically	3287	B
like months yeah yeah that's true	3287	B
um-hum	3287	B
yeah and i did too like when i was walking you know the most and i had a real good program going i had much more energy and i literally would go walk	3287	B
and be a be just a little tired at first but then i'd have a lot of energy even right after i walked right	3287	B
because_1 i'm sure you're exhausted too	3287	B
i know yeah	3287	B
well and it clears your mind and you know i'm sure you're real stressed out and tired and	3287	B
oh yeah if you do both- if you're at both of them	3287	B
uh-huh	3287	B
um-hum	3287	B
well if you're there you know	3287	B
i punched it	3287	A
do you really	3287	A
what- what do you do	3287	A
oh yeah	3287	A
oh okay	3287	A
well that's great and you don't do anything- things aerobic	3287	A
um-hum	3287	A
um-hum	3287	A
oh i know it that's pretty boring really	3287	A
your in you and Doug you and Doug	3287	A
oh that is great that you have it right there well i love getting outside so that's i mean it's real relaxing to me to just to get out and walk or whatever most of the time i walk	3287	A
yeah that's i walk and uh usually with a neighbor and uh and we walk about two and a half miles so um	3287	A
yeah right and that oh oh i don't either i i i like to walk if i have to walk inside i don't mind going to um the	3287	A
oh is it Plano Center or whatever right uh-huh now that's nice but	3287	A
it's not like being outside i agree and um so i did- only did that in the wintertime but um anyway i'm	3287	A
i'm just thankful to get to do it when i get to do it i tell you um	3287	A
i sometimes i'll get home you know at least a couple a days a week and be able to on the during the weekdays and try to on the weekends- weekends too well how- how long do we have to talk	3287	A
have we talked the three minutes	3287	A
i know we're not supposed to talk but	3287	A
oh	3287	A
oh i agree uh because i have done what- but now i have to say though that if i didn't exercise i'd weigh more	3287	A
um-hum um-hum	3287	A
um-hum	3287	A
um-hum	3287	A
um-hum you can um-hum	3287	A
{weightwise} yeah oh i agree- i really do think the eating makes the the big difference but um and you have to exercise	3287	A
i think for a long period of time that's what Doug uh always gives up too- too soon before it really starts feeling the real benefits from it	3287	A
but no i meant uh months yeah i mean regularly for months because um	3287	A
uh the first time i started running- i used to run and i ran for six months with these friends and after that	3287	A
i started- i really saw the difference i i only did it before then because it was just fun to meet them and go run and uh but after that i i mean i changed sizes i didn't lose much weight but i changed sizes and um	3287	A
and i really could see a difference i could see a difference when i played tennis and that kind of thing you know just had much more stamina and and all that but	3287	A
um-hum	3287	A
um-hum	3287	A
yeah when you get back you- i- i know that helps me a lot coming in- in from school to go out because i don't think i can possibly do it and then i do it and i- i feel better	3287	A
because_1 then- otherwise i'd come in and sit down and then i feel like i can't get up	3287	A
um-hum	3287	A
um-hum oh i really am in fact um i'd the last two weeks i'd i was uh i talked to	3287	A
Lynn yesterday afternoon because i had to talk to her about something else and i was telling her i said gosh i- i just don't know if i should sing in this thing or not because i missed the last two weeks and so if i come Wednesday night and Saturday do you think i can do it	3287	A
and i have the tape i'm been trying to and earnestly listen to it better lately but um i had a program on Thursday night before	3287	A
the one two weeks ago and just had a horrendous week and i was just so stressed it wasn't even funny and i just could not possibly make it that that Wednesday and then this last Wednesday	3287	A
Doug had a TI event you know uh where the wives went and that i i really needed to go with him not many things like that happen that we have to go to like you know where the wives have to go and so	3287	A
and it was good that i went but um anyway i hated missing two times	3287	A
okay the topic of the conversation is national health insurance and the pros and cons and do i do we think that the government should finance it what is your opinion	3226	A
you say yes	3226	A
i have heard someone else uh say that uh the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent	3226	A
and one of the ways that they're financing it is they have an exorbitant tax on their cigarettes	3226	A
this is	3226	A
evidently- evidently this is one of the ways that they're paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they don't have to pay out as many uh benefits on like lung cancer and things like this	3226	A
yeah if	3226	A
oh my word Lynn	3226	A
that's horrible	3226	A
well we're fortunate in that we so far knock on wood most of us have been relatively- real healthy so we don't have a lot of medical bills	3226	A
yeah but what worries me is the fact that	3226	A
i don't like the government telling me who i can see and who i can't see	3226	A
um-hum	3226	A
are they	3226	A
well i know that Greg uh James had it	3226	A
i beg your pardon	3226	A
yeah yeah i know that when James was with Continental Steel	3226	A
McCullum was part of that and and that's good but i also heard for instance like uh	3226	A
a friend's daughter was on it through Texas Instruments and she was on that Kaiser Permanent	3226	A
and they had screwed up her appointment and when she went in she had to take whichever doctor was available	3226	A
and they she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted	3226	A
but then again i guess you can even do that in McCullum's	3226	A
um-hum	3226	A
uh-huh	3226	A
um-hum	3226	A
well that's true and that still goes on	3226	A
um-hum	3226	A
right	3226	A
well you know it uh	3226	A
how do you think we're going to pay for it	3226	A
more and more taxes	3226	A
i know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses	3226	A
they don't pay anything on uh implants or transplants	3226	A
and you know people are needing these and the average person can't afford you know a heart or a kidney	3226	A
on just their own	3226	A
uh-huh	3226	A
good grief	3226	A
um-hum	3226	A
hum	3226	A
um-hum um-hum	3226	A
that's very true	3226	A
well i know they have the Medicaid you know for those that have trouble and i know that like we have the uh prescription cards which that's helped bunches	3226	A
and wonder if the insurance companies are fighting the national health or wonder if they're wanting it	3226	A
that they are wanting	3226	A
i say yes	3226	B
yes mother lives in Florida and there are in her subdivision there are fifty percent Canadians who won't give up their Canadian citizenship because of the health insurance	3226	B
it's wonderful	3226	B
oh well	3226	B
well even if that's so you know really when you look at it they have full coverage they have HMO which you know after you get used to it it's not too bad	3226	B
and uh everything is covered	3226	B
and we have so many people in the United States that we spend well in my family alone we spent four thousand dollars in July on medical bills	3226	B
insurance didn't cover a penny yeah	3226	B
yes it is horrible	3226	B
yeah but if	3226	B
uh if you're healthy it's fine but i had two kids in the hospital in July	3226	B
yeah but you know Richardson School District has the HMO and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list	3226	B
yeah	3226	B
McCullum is	3226	B
McCullum is	3226	B
uh-huh	3226	B
well but that's	3226	B
that's a screw up in an appointment you know i'm thinking- going back to the days when i was pregnant	3226	B
and i had two doctors	3226	B
and one was my favorite personality wise	3226	B
but when i delivered Ronnie he was not on call the other guy delivered him	3226	B
you know and that and you know if um i go to Townsend he's got a new partner	3226	B
i go to both of them now	3226	B
you know i have no choice	3226	B
you know because when i want to go if Doctor Howe or whatever his name is is on duty i go to him	3226	B
well no we need to cut some of our spendings	3226	B
cut some of the fat off the top	3226	B
and whittle it down to the rest of us	3226	B
no	3226	B
no	3226	B
yeah	3226	B
but you known Ronnie in Austin	3226	B
went to a program and went to a social worker	3226	B
and at the same token there is something because he can get his pills for two dollars when i'm paying fifteen on my medical insurance	3226	B
and he can get free medical care but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing David	3226	B
and so again you know we went through it Ronnie's home tonight and we talked about it and said you know is it worth it yeah you know he pays forty five dollars a month for his prescriptions where he could pay six dollars	3226	B
so there are programs you know if you get on Medicare or Medicaid or one of those	3226	B
yeah	3226	B
that's what i read	3226	B
how would you go about organizing a family reunion	3202	A
oh gee	3202	A
oh my	3202	A
uh-huh	3202	A
yes	3202	A
with all of you living so close together	3202	A
oh	3202	A
well i come from a very small family and we planned a family reunion this spring um where we are from Texas and my family's from Ohio and we met in Florida	3202	A
so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together	3202	A
so that's all the family so planning our family reunion- reunion was very easy	3202	A
yeah it was we had a wonderful time-	3202	A
well i from- i grew up in the Deep South like south Alabama so whenever i think of family reunions my family like got together almost every week	3202	B
and there'd be like thirty people so people talk about you know big family reunions and i- i think like i have a friend who just went to like Wyoming to some big ranch you know where like there were four hundred people	3202	B
for- for their family reunion and i so i mean how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives	3202	B
because i since i came from my father has uh five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters	3202	B
so i can- both of my parents had big families	3202	B
and we always were we always got together just always	3202	B
now it's different because i live here and i've you know when i go home i try to see the families as much of the family as i can but it's real different and i grew up in a real not i think not normal setting	3202	B
right i mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's and you know like i said there'd be thirty you know a thirty people and everyone would just bring things and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook and	3202	B
it-	3202	B
um-hum	3202	B
yeah i guess so and sounds like it was fun	3202	B
right um	2661	A
we eat out quite a bit it's just my husband and i at home now so	2661	A
oh at least once a week	2661	A
we're we're retired now when we working out we ate out more than that	2661	A
uh	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
well what type of restaurant do you like Richard	2661	A
right	2661	A
oh have you we like Chinese we eat a lot of Chinese food	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
what do you look for in a restaurant	2661	A
you what you	2661	A
oh i	2661	A
right	2661	A
i know what you mean i like some ambience and	2661	A
i like good food i don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
right uh-huh i don't care to go to a place just	2661	A
for the price of it huh	2661	A
i mean it's uh continental French restaurant or something really	2661	A
with high prices and seven courses isn't what i usually look for	2661	A
it isn't no that isn't what i look for	2661	A
right	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
presentation and	2661	A
well like	2661	A
we we've been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently and we're trying to give them a little patronage but	2661	A
Sunday we went there and i had a	2661	A
pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple	2661	A
and potatoes	2661	A
but i said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce or something like that	2661	A
yeah that's what i mean by right uh-huh	2661	A
it would mean a lot to the looks of the plate	2661	A
Tex-Mex Tex-Mex	2661	A
right i know	2661	A
uh	2661	A
we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico and we've really gotten to like we like the real Mexican food better than the Tex-Mex	2661	A
right	2661	A
it's all pretty good isn't it	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
right uh-huh that's true	2661	A
i'm originally from Maine so we like seafood too and that's something we don't get here and we're in the mountains in Virginia	2661	A
and most of the seafood's frozen	2661	A
right	2661	A
uh-huh true lots of shrimp	2661	A
i know it	2661	A
i know the feeling	2661	A
we do the same thing my son-in-law is a Texan and when he goes to Maine he eats lobster i guess at least twice a day all the time he's up there	2661	A
oh yes yeah it's like	2661	A
two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster	2661	A
yeah	2661	A
oh yeah or cheaper right yeah a lot of the restaurants you can get	2661	A
two pound- two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine	2661	A
yeah it's a good place to go	2661	A
lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that up there	2661	A
yeah	2661	A
right uh-huh	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
we went to Galveston-	2661	A
we were in Galveston last year after- right after- well the first of this year actually	2661	A
and uh ate in a restaurant and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf Coast	2661	A
no it wasn't on the way across Louisiana we pulled off we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place	2661	A
and they had it was a small restaurant just kind of out of the way	2661	A
and they were set up with two buffets one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything and then one complete seafood buffet	2661	A
that was the best shrimp i have ever had in my life they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways	2661	A
uh-huh right it was wonderful	2661	A
uh-huh	2661	A
uh i tried it but i didn't care for it not there but at my brothers i tried it	2661	A
that's probably true it	2661	A
i wasn't hungry it wasn't a meal we just he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them just so we'd try them	2661	A
probably needed some cold beer with it and	2661	A
quite a bit	2661	A
oh	2661	A
right	2661	A
we used to do that once in a while but we don't anymore	2661	A
uh-huh it's fun but it's just so much food hate to come away feeling uncomfortable	2661	A
do you well that makes a difference	2661	A
where do you go to brunches like hotels or	2661	A
restaurants there	2661	A
oh yeah uh-huh	2661	A
we eat at Shoney's	2661	A
oh	2661	A
uh-huh that sounds nice	2661	A
right i imagine it is	2661	A
uh uh-huh	2661	A
where- out of which direction from- out of which direction from there west uh-huh	2661	A
yeah	2661	A
so eating out	2661	B
what are you interested in in restaurants	2661	B
oh	2661	B
uh once a week twice a week	2661	B
yeah i understand	2661	B
uh but we both work and we have a daughter and	2661	B
we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway	2661	B
uh	2661	B
really i'm kind of open on food i'm	2661	B
what you might call a culinary adventurer i'll	2661	B
i'll try anything once	2661	B
been on a real barbecue kick lately	2661	B
yeah	2661	B
excuse me uh	2661	B
yeah	2661	B
we usually have Chinese once a month	2661	B
uh i hate franchised restaurants	2661	B
i despise franchised restaurants i- i	2661	B
always prefer to go to	2661	B
something that seems more family run uh	2661	B
some place where you	2661	B
seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost	2661	B
i don't	2661	B
but i don't like something fake or put on either uh	2661	B
you know if i could have the the good small restaurant or a good large restaurant i'd go to the good small restaurant	2661	B
and	2661	B
i don't know why that is	2661	B
i think it's probably due to	2661	B
pricing often	2661	B
well yeah yeah	2661	B
yeah	2661	B
it is what you usually look oh isn't isn't	2661	B
uh	2661	B
i try to	2661	B
get my money's worth	2661	B
and uh	2661	B
not just that i try to	2661	B
well that's a big part of it i try to get my money's worth	2661	B
you know	2661	B
and not just in quantity you know but but quality and and	2661	B
flavor and and texture and care	2661	B
well presentation's not always all of it either it's it's important	2661	B
but	2661	B
um-hum	2661	B
yeah yeah something a little extra	2661	B
and just for color if nothing else	2661	B
yeah	2661	B
yeah	2661	B
what i miss up here is	2661	B
i'm originally a Texan	2661	B
and i'm	2661	B
miss	2661	B
home cooked Mexican yeah yeah home cooked Tex-Mex uh Mexican restaurants where	2661	B
it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation	2661	B
and	2661	B
yeah	2661	B
well there's real Mexican food and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by	2661	B
third or fourth generation Americans	2661	B
of the Hispanic heritage	2661	B
oh yes and and there's big differences of course and	2661	B
of course when you talk about Mexican cuisine you that's kind of like talking about American food or or a Chinese food because	2661	B
its regional too	2661	B
you know	2661	B
ah	2661	B
ah yeah that's the way it is here in Colorado also	2661	B
no fresh or almost no fresh seafood	2661	B
and	2661	B
in Texas we got it from the Gulf	2661	B
and	2661	B
yeah here a couple years ago my wife and i went to Seattle on vacation	2661	B
and i think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week and it was	2661	B
i was like a man starving at every meal	2661	B
ha	2661	B
it's a lot cheaper there isn't it lobster	2661	B
it's like shrimp on the Gulf	2661	B
two ninety eight a pound	2661	B
that's as cheap as steaks some places	2661	B
i mean in a grocery store yeah	2661	B
oh my gosh i've got to go to Maine then i you may have sold a trip for some time	2661	B
uh it sounds wonderful uh so	2661	B
that sound good i	2661	B
down in the Gulf i've eaten a bunch of those little	2661	B
oh seafood shacks we've called them	2661	B
and	2661	B
uh it's just it so much different than to eat something that's been frozen	2661	B
you know	2661	B
shrimp straight out of the bay- bay	2661	B
hm	2661	B
was it true	2661	B
um	2661	B
ah yes the cajuns	2661	B
they can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can so have you eaten crawfish yet	2661	B
oh as with anything it's preparation	2661	B
uh	2661	B
uh-huh	2661	B
it there's all kinds	2661	B
so you do eat out a lot	2661	B
uh one of our other	2661	B
real problems with going out to eat Sunday morning brunches	2661	B
you know Sunday brunch all all you can eat brunches	2661	B
uh we still find it fun	2661	B
but	2661	B
well am	2661	B
i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor	2661	B
and so	2661	B
uh	2661	B
yeah uh actually one of our	2661	B
one of our favorites is a chain	2661	B
Shoney's	2661	B
and in spite of the	2661	B
and in spite of the fact i've spoken so badly about chains chain restaurants uh	2661	B
we uh do like Shoney's pretty well but then there's a	2661	B
place up the pass up in the mountains	2661	B
that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings	2661	B
drive drive up to i think it's about	2661	B
eight thousand foot elevation and	2661	B
and	2661	B
and drive through Woodland Park and	2661	B
go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast and	2661	B
it it	2661	B
it's the way to spend a a nice Sunday morning	2661	B
i think it's as much the the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch you know and it's not that far it's thirty miles	2661	B
the Colorado Springs what	2661	B
west west out of Colorado-	2661	B
we're supposed to talk about recent political developments	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
they want him because he's popular not because he can do the job	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
i- i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
he he you know we know he's a good leader we know he's a good organizer the question is you know can he be the man who's ultimately responsible you know like what he said is	2663	B
you know a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about you know people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that he says i'm following the orders of my President i'm not the one who writes the orders i'm just the one who follows them	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
well you know Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait	2663	B
and so he went to the President and said okay here's how i want to do it but uh he wasn't the one that decided that Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait	2663	B
uh-huh	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
well the the thing that i'm wondering about is how we get a new congress how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them_1	2663	B
to not get reelected over and over again	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
i think-	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
that may be our only answer but i don't really like it	2663	B
i don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve	2663	B
because i think if the President be him Republican or Democrat i think if the President can prove	2663	B
that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want i think the reason why we've got these guys in congress is because of the fund-raising rules i mean	2663	B
how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year did they get after they were elected just you know just after they were elected two years ago	2663	B
basically the people as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them_1 and say yeah yeah you're my friend you're my friend and two years later he remembers that so what they've done is bought this congressman for two years	2663	B
yeah well	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
that's that's the easy way i think the harder way out would be to make the uh the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground	2663	B
and that's that's what the financing rules and the uh the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
well i think a lot more people could vote if	2663	B
they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about	2663	B
you know like you know the the recent uh election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up that election last December	2663	B
i'm in yeah i'm in Dallas city limit	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
yes	2663	B
it's an ugly mess	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
the manager	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
i don't yeah well what get's me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes	2663	B
and if if it had passed if these people had gotten out the vote it would have passed and there'd be no more argument but they're still fighting about it because of the way that election went last December	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
um-hum yeah	2663	B
but but this was for supposedly to benefit the minorities and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote and they would have had their way	2663	B
yeah it's pretty sad	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
uh my my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
um-hum	2663	B
and and you ask them_1 why they don't vote they say well they don't want their name on the uh jury duty list	2663	B
they that that's where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration list	2663	B
i think they could	2663	B
yeah	2663	B
in Presidential races that's about what they've done but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things	2663	B
right	2663	B
actually i haven't made any calls but i received about a dozen i- i think yeah i have to make these but i get distracted and get to do something else and all of a sudden my phone rings and go oh what the heck we'll talk for a while	2663	B
yeah we got a whole bunch i can't remember how many	2663	B
you might be well i think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway we're supposed to do five minutes and that was three minutes ago hey well thanks for the call yeah bye	2663	B
i just pressed my uh	2663	A
i got one that's interesting not too controversial- not too controversial i you know not doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican i- i do get somewhat of a kick out of	2663	A
because Schwartzkopf or the other generals who i admire how everyone wants to make get them in politics i think that's kind of an interesting recent thing that that i could think of recently that uh i was wondering what you thought about that making the generals uh	2663	A
getting a general into politics	2663	A
right although i've i've been thinking about it and i uh i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero those we're looking for a hero although Time magazine was saying that uh in essence the the general's staff	2663	A
was comparing to corporate presidents and they said that in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more	2663	A
they are much more educated than the average corporate president and so the really were very positive on a general's staff person having a a very much better education than the average uh corporate president so i thought well maybe	2663	A
well that too that too and uh you know they talk about the Army and because of the war and why did we win and all that and they talked about how the training was so important and that's so important in industry so	2663	A
you know they're liable to be right that that generals generals in the service and Schwartzkopf uh you know might make a good uh politician whether it be Governor or whatever you know	2663	A
yeah it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs you know that the everyone has a boss of course uh	2663	A
yeah	2663	A
no that's true that's true	2663	A
uh you you you pick one i- i- just i just thought of that one when when they brought up about politics that was uh pretty easy	2663	A
uh you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican you can pick anything you want go ahead	2663	A
well i have an easy answer for that oh i wish they would do it is that limit it you know to uh eight or ten years max you know whether that's two two uh five year terms or whatever	2663	A
oh you know you're not	2663	A
yeah	2663	A
yeah	2663	A
yeah	2663	A
yeah i don't know i do like the the limitation of the President and uh i think there is a needed change i	2663	A
i- i think the same thing should happen for Congress uh i'd like you know that would be my answer of an easy way to to get these guys out of there for twenty years my God it's ridiculous you know	2663	A
we had	2663	A
i think voting is a problem- i think i had one of the subject about voting and uh voting apathy or something like that and i think that uh the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time i- i can't believe that a country our big	2663	A
votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock at night you know of course they have absentee which is getting to be more a lot easier and i- i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now but	2663	A
i think gee whiz you could make it a couple days uh it's just uh if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them_1 a couple of days	2663	A
yeah yeah	2663	A
are you in Dallas	2663	A
boy i- i am in Arlington i am so happy not to be part of Dallas when i see those those folks there	2663	A
i mean uh i don't know if you like the mayor but i think your mayor the city council the what is the woman's name whose uh not the mayor but the	2663	A
yeah the city manager all of them_1 need to be thrown out i mean they're just awful they're awful	2663	A
um-hum	2663	A
i know	2663	A
it's so awful that uh politicians always spent consulting money that we put them_1 in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars	2663	A
to buy consultants and then they don't even do that recommendation you know i mean it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in	2663	A
well you're right there	2663	A
you're right there uh uh people are uh uh politics uh the voting is still not uh as much as you think in all kinds of issues really	2663	A
yeah it is uh uh hopefully people will get more involved uh	2663	A
oh yeah but but those are the ones that are complaining i- i think a lot i see it here at TI	2663	A
the guys that don't take any interest in and and constantly on the negative of everything	2663	A
and uh	2663	A
oh is that right ooh	2663	A
right you're right you're right	2663	A
i think they could do more about uh voting	2663	A
what are the issues i i'm a Democrat i want to just say that i'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat i don't even know i could i could go out and	2663	A
and debate George Bush better than i see any Democrat doing it you know i mean at least i'd like to see competition- because i like competition you know	2663	A
and i think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead i'm so disgusted with the Democratic party i can not believe it you know	2663	A
yeah	2663	A
but i still think in the last uh ten years you know of course that's not a recent event that's only my opinion i guess that way i shouldn't talk about that but uh	2663	A
i don't know whether they're recent events i guess they were- on this uh speech thing they want us to use a variety of words you know	2663	A
how many times have you called by the way i	2663	A
oh really i- i	2663	A
yeah i- i've already got uh twelve cards you get any cards in the mail you know	2663	A
i don't know i'm amazed by of course we're not talking about politics but i am amazed by people say they got thirty i wonder why you need	2663	A
thirty renditions of the persons voice but i'm not in voice uh synthesis but i'd sure like to see a summary of it we'll get to politics i'm sorry	2663	A
yeah right	2663	A
yeah	2663	A
yeah bye-bye	2663	A
okay the topic was uh should the United States adopt the metric system and if so should uh oh	2669	A
and why didn't it work last time well yeah well i'm	2669	A
i i am too i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the the problem because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that you know trying to convert over	2669	A
and i guess what'd they try they tried what'd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion one of them_1 is where you just take whatever's already standard and you give it some sort of a weird	2669	A
metric number like uh six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter something like that	2669	A
yeah and uh	2669	A
i i don't know uh	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
well don't most of them_1 doesn't just about everything now have uh both	2669	A
uh metric and English	2669	A
oh yeah yeah	2669	A
um-hum	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up uh you know pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range somebody had uh i believe it was Exxon	2669	A
we we were living in uh	2669	A
thirty nine cents a liter and nobody had any idea what a liter was so	2669	A
uh	2669	A
when you finally figured out that liters what about a quart there's about four liters in a gallon you know so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it	2669	A
um-hum	2669	A
yeah oh i've never	2669	A
yeah i yeah	2669	A
the uh i think maybe there's where the the problem came in you know we uh tried to instead of learning it's kind of like learning a language you know when you learn one from the other	2669	A
yeah you always end up in this conversion thing all the time so it's- you it's almost like uh course this country isn't a dictatorship but you know it's like somebody said okay as of such and such a date	2669	A
you know anybody caught talking in the English metric- you know in the will be shot or something like that you know but uh uh	2669	A
yeah i read that what Uganda and uh	2669	A
uh	2669	A
there's one or two others that just	2669	A
um-hum	2669	A
yeah well i i	2669	A
yeah i i do too and uh one of the things that we've run- run into a a problem of course you're familiar with the TI drawing well with any drawing system you end up with uh you end up with things in inches	2669	A
in parts of inches you know fourth- half fourth you know this sort of thing and then you end up with a decimal	2669	A
where you start getting into {mils} and that sort of thing and then some of them are are done in uh you know purely metric	2669	A
and it	2669	A
um-hum um-hum	2669	A
yeah oh i can imagine	2669	A
the uh the one that uh	2669	A
uh have you ever lived in a country where they use metric	2669	A
or	2669	A
i was with TI in in El Salvador for a while	2669	A
and uh i had to get used to you know purely metric system down there	2669	A
and- because_1 they they didn't understand anything else you know if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what you know	2669	A
so	2669	A
uh i had a little bit of experience with it and also i noticed in Canada they uh you drop a a quarter fifty cents whatever in a	2669	A
Coke machine up there and you get this funny looking Coke you know it's in a can that's uh	2669	A
that's taller but not as big around you know i guess that's some	2669	A
it's not it's not a liter it's like a half a liter or something like that it's a strange looking can	2669	A
but my daughter-in-law's from Panama and she has they have uh	2669	A
had Americans down there for so long you know that they're they're kind of into both systems but uh she gets real confused on distances and temperature is the big thing is the the Centigrade for which she says Celsius	2669	A
well i had kind of gotten used to uh centigrade temperature you know if it's between zero and ten it's cold and if it's between ten and twenty it's not too bad if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm and if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out so	2669	A
but uh the big problem is not having the uh uh	2669	A
the resolution between temperature you know between a hundred and if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero you know thirty four degrees whatever that is you know you- you don't get all the little	2669	A
the differences you know the differences between seventy and seventy two or seventy five degrees isn't much but the difference between thirty and thirty five degrees is is quite a bit yeah	2669	A
yeah five well i	2669	A
yeah something like that yeah	2669	A
i	2669	A
um-hum	2669	A
yeah i know we keep calling it the English system but i'm i'm not sure what they do in England now they're they're on metric aren't they	2669	A
yeah except they've got a now okay there we ran into some problems once i remember uh they've got a a nut and bolts system called Wentworth	2669	A
and uh this thing was was even different than you know SAE standards and stuff so	2669	A
uh uh	2669	A
this this came- okay my my dad bought uh one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years back- you know quite a few years back	2669	A
and the thing had uh uh an Austin Heeley type uh engine you know it was Austin motors engine and running gear	2669	A
and the body was built by Nash or who you know American it wasn't that was even before American Motors but Nash essentially in the US somewhere	2669	A
and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and uh SAE he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing because uh	2669	A
i think the Wentworth and the SAE bolt sizes were the same but the threads were different	2669	A
and uh it was it was- it was a it was a total mess-	2669	A
and i know on my Chevy van that's a couple of years old uh part of it's built in Canada	2669	A
but it's got the darndest combination of uh of metric and	2669	A
most of the body parts seem to be metric and most of the engine parts seem to be SAE so it's	2669	A
it's just crazy	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
um-hum	2669	A
um-hum	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because_1 what is it fifty six or fifty seven's a hundred	2669	A
uh uh or a hundred kilometers and uh you know a hundred- a hundred yeah you'd have a hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five but you'd have people going you're right a hundred miles an hour yeah	2669	A
and so i don't know i'd kind of and the other thing too is you know between here and	2669	A
El Paso's what five hundred miles but it's it's almost eight hundred kilometers you know that'd sure seems like a long way	2669	A
yeah i guess that's it	2669	A
well they converted all the road signs to fifty five miles an hour you know they could of converted it to metric just about as easy	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
not all that common	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
i was-	2669	A
yeah	2669	A
i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was was in Panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in uh	2669	A
in miles per hour	2669	A
and some are in uh	2669	A
in kilometers and you you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour but any	2669	A
how should they do it why didn't it work last time	2669	B
well	2669	B
i'm all for it	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
yeah they tried to	2669	B
yeah yeah direct conversion	2669	B
i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all all the way you know new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way	2669	B
but if you start-	2669	B
they do but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages you know you buy a quart of milk and sure it has has the metric equivalent written on there but it still a quart so if they started putting it in liters liter of oil and	2669	B
you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric as long as you can still buy a product in the English units that's how you're going to think of it	2669	B
figures	2669	B
right	2669	B
yeah that's that's the problem	2669	B
right it's kind of hard for me to believe that this this day and age i don't know when i was growing up we were taught the metric system in school i mean not not at first but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway	2669	B
it's i would expect people with any kind of	2669	B
buying power over the age of- or you know under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway a liter's about a quart	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
well thing is it's a global	2669	B
global market place these days and you know we're one of like what two backwards countries in the world as far as	2669	B
uh	2669	B
something i don't remember what the other one is but	2669	B
it's it's just time i think for for us to go over because_1 all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international	2669	B
i don't you know i don't know i uh i work for TI we're all around the world you have to perform this conversion anyway	2669	B
and	2669	B
right {mils} and microns	2669	B
right	2669	B
right	2669	B
right	2669	B
yeah i remember how big stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns and ours were in {mils}	2669	B
and it got to you know somewhere down the line they went standardized they went microns but uh	2669	B
you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs	2669	B
and	2669	B
so	2669	B
no	2669	B
no	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
about a half a liter or something	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
i would have more problem with-	2669	B
more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering	2669	B
we do everything in Centigrade or Celsius	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
getting warm right	2669	B
yeah well it's about	2669	B
yeah it's about twice as much yeah what it works out to	2669	B
one point one point eight times as many	2669	B
points yeah so	2669	B
i don't know i think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the American way	2669	B
and until we have to have to learn to think that way we we won't	2669	B
yeah for the most part i think so	2669	B
right	2669	B
right	2669	B
he just get one more	2669	B
oh that would be a mess	2669	B
well i guess it just gets bad down to you got to you got to have one and not mix them_1 up because you're never going to get to one one system if you still- still got a got a mix	2669	B
and of course here that that would involve changing road signs all across the country you know miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole whole nine yards	2669	B
it's kind of hard to do gradually	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
oh hell you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
yeah but they'd need they'd seem to be ticking off faster too	2669	B
every road sign you come to is like well i didn't know i went that far	2669	B
i don't know	2669	B
yeah i think they you got the problem with all your cars are still	2669	B
yeah you still got cars on the road that don't have both	2669	B
at that time anyway the	2669	B
that was still when things were the metric system was still not	2669	B
yeah you know now cars they have both	2669	B
sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way	2669	B
yeah	2669	B
start	2672	A
um the well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper	2672	A
um plastic	2672	A
um i think three bins for glass white green and whatever- whatever other combination there is and i think they've got a container uh some kind of container for aluminum	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
um	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
um	2672	A
well that's good well Rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many people were interested in having a a pick up	2672	A
i guess on the days they do trash or something like that And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably- favorably because they're going to do it i don't know how how soon they're going to do it or	2672	A
how organized it's going to be but they're they're supposed to initiate that some sometime in the next couple of months	2672	A
um i've never noticed that we don't have a a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um	2672	A
um no there's there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea	2672	A
no not not really	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
um	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
um-hum	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
that's good	2672	A
yeah i i guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is	2672	A
and i think they're trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about	2672	A
doing lawn work and how- how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag	2672	A
just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all- all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff	2672	A
and it's uh i guess a lot more ecological- ecological to just mow the grass and	2672	A
let it work it's way back into the soil	2672	A
i saw part of that	2672	A
um-hum	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
um	2672	A
yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't i'm that's uh one of the things i wonder about uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else i i wonder about some of the products- products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take	2672	A
uh why why they couldn't do more recycling with those	2672	A
hum	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
true yeah i noticed that about things like i seen- i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and	2672	A
and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy so in in terms of that it's you know	2672	A
for the environment it its there is good reason to do it the cost is kind of prohibited	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
yeah it's a good idea	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
yeah true	2672	A
um	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on uh	2672	A
on the radio station i think it's K L T Y they were talking about the i think it's in Canada they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs	2672	A
as a a reinforcement for roads for road repairs	2672	A
and apparently they they don't break down very easily and	2672	A
they don't expand or or contract when the weather changes and this is kind of an unusual use for	2672	A
that type of thing	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
huh	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
yeah	2672	A
true	2672	A
uh-huh	2672	A
what kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett	2672	B
Plano's doing real good on that they have uh they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans	2672	B
which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it and of course it doesn't fit right now but now we start in May breaking it down and they're picking it all up	2672	B
so they're going to by and we have to separate our papers and our glass and then uh they have one day for like um	2672	B
oh everything you picked up from your yard and we put that in disposable bags and they pick that up on Monday	2672	B
so it's really great i i'm really going head you know completely for it i think it's marvelous	2672	B
well does your uh where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that	2672	B
well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know pop cans and things like that	2672	B
so you don't have much choice there	2672	B
well i work at uh JC Penny and last week they brought they have a sign up that says for one full week	2672	B
you bring in your old wire hangers	2672	B
and they are going to recycle them_1	2672	B
so it's getting people clean out their closets and such and then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in and they brought it down to the shelters	2672	B
and they have one two they have	2672	B
three i think that i know of for cans for people have pop and they put them right near where they have the time cards and it works great and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too	2672	B
so they're really going at it and i think it's marvelous because_1	2672	B
well	2672	B
uh-huh	2672	B
well did you watch the program the other night on um was it Save America it was good	2672	B
the only thing i guess- thought um that i haven't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before	2672	B
but i've already gone to oh i started years ago i guess not years ago but yeah i would say five years ago turning off my fountain i mean my water faucet in the sink when i brush my teeth	2672	B
but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water that was surprising to me	2672	B
i missed that question totally i mean really bad i'm trying to think i didn't miss too many i can't remember what my score was but i did exceeding well i was surprised	2672	B
but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me	2672	B
well i was in uh Bizmart the other day and what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more	2672	B
than regular paper	2672	B
and it was only i think uh forty cents more you know fifty cents more but	2672	B
it {upseted} me to realize that hey the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling but people aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher	2672	B
uh-huh	2672	B
now see that's recycling	2672	B
you know companies that do at least go into it i'd like to see subsidy by the government or something or {taxwise} or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular	2672	B
so that people would use this stuff reuse- over again	2672	B
it's like when he was saying uh which one was recyclable which was reusable and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles	2672	B
and if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it	2672	B
that's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back it's not recyclable	2672	B
uh-huh	2672	B
oh really	2672	B
oh	2672	B
well you know they're along that same line they said they were using um	2672	B
what is oh i know it was toilets you know the old ones smashing them up because they're that stuff there is great for in road work	2672	B
and i thought well that's good and then i saw recycling on tires between uh well hoses were being used	2672	B
and uh uh soaker hoses made out of old tires what else something else was made out of old tires i was trying to remember what it was	2672	B
oh i can't think of it now	2672	B
but i was i was trying to get my uh kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes	2672	B
and just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring them- back and then i forget to bring them in the store	2672	B
i'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away	2672	B
you know what i'd like to see a little more i don't have any little tiny kids but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now	2672	B
in five years when they get bigger it'll work a little bit more too	2672	B
because it's we've all got to do it right now i just	2672	B
i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty per cent are filled now in in garbage fills in five years we're supposed to be at max	2672	B
i don't think i can keep my own garbage	2672	B
i mean i might not have that much	2672	B
but i would	2672	B
um do you have a favorite credit card that you use	2682	B
because any particular reason	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
yeah i know what you mean	2682	B
uh-huh	2682	B
oh really wow	2682	B
well i use um a credit card that's given out by US Air	2682	B
well not given out i mean there's an annual fee um and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile	2682	B
and um my husband and i tend to charge a lot	2682	B
and even things that we wouldn't normally charge now we charge because we've racked up seriously close in the past couple years close to five or six thousand dollars just by charging	2682	B
and um it's really great because you can get some good discounts um on US Air you know using frequent flyer mileage and all that	2682	B
um and the annual fee isn't bad i think it's maybe thirty five dollars a year	2682	B
um and here in Rochester maybe in in Pennsylvania also but you can charge your groceries	2682	B
can you do that there	2682	B
which is great	2682	B
oh	2682	B
oh do do they accept Discover or no	2682	B
um-hum yeah	2682	B
well i love it and now um actually our our mortgage company is uh starting i think June first or something is going to start allowing people to charge their mortgage	2682	B
and that's going to be great	2682	B
um and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill	2682	B
and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest	2682	B
i refuse to pay interest if i'm going to do that i'm not going to use a credit card	2682	B
so what i do now is i- i work it like a checkbook and every time i charge something i write it out i write it out	2682	B
so i'm not fooling myself into thinking i have that money	2682	B
you know i write it out and then it's it's as if i paid in cash	2682	B
so you're somebody that will pay off your bills right away	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum yep i know what you mean	2682	B
oh	2682	B
well that makes sense	2682	B
right	2682	B
oh yeah	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
really well-	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
a discount- yeah yeah	2682	B
seem	2682	B
um-hum it's definitely worth it if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea	2682	B
because you don't have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the interest you know if you charge at the beginning of the month then you're getting a month's worth of interest	2682	B
in your account	2682	B
um but the second you let it go even one month um they had made an error on our statement where they they never posted the payment yet i had the canceled check i had everything	2682	B
and um i mean for that amount it was like a thirty dollar interest charge	2682	B
that's like another purchase for me it buying something	2682	B
yeah but um you know one thing one of the reasons because_1 i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and and a lot of reason i have those cards is because J C Penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it	2682	B
yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you you know sign up and	2682	B
and uh as long as it because_1 i don't J C Penney doesn't cost you anything i don't think	2682	B
right and so as long as it doesn't cost you anything then	2682	B
oh yeah	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
yeah	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
um-hum oh yeah	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
oh right	2682	B
uh wow that is great	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
yeah-	2682	B
right and that's thirty dollars that you didn't pay any money to have it in the first place	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
one thing i still don't understand about credit cards is	2682	B
how you can borrow money off a credit card i still haven't quite figured that out	2682	B
i know i don't trust it either and um i know you can do it with a Visa card but it just seems like too simple and i know that there's some hidden	2682	B
yeah	2682	B
yeah yeah	2682	B
on your what	2682	B
oh just yeah the machine	2682	B
one thing that um that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone	2682	B
or you know if i- i- i tend to buy a lot of things from TV like not not the shopper's thing but sometimes they'll be something good that they're selling a record or something like that and um	2682	B
and after i do it i think God who did i give my number to	2682	B
and um you know what are they going to do with it how can i trust them or whatever	2682	B
but um the credit card company i did have a charge on there once that i had no receipt for i had no recollection i didn't even know the the store	2682	B
and they took it right off no questions i just said this isn't my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you can't then um you know just take it off	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
yeah	2682	B
oh yeah	2682	B
yeah they would pursue it definitely	2682	B
yeah	2682	B
oh yeah	2682	B
um-hum um yeah	2682	B
right	2682	B
right yeah that's true before you could at least deduct if you did pay any interest you could at least deduct that from your taxes	2682	B
but now you can't do it and i know people that have racked up	2682	B
they keep- they keep getting their limit extended because they keep exceeding it	2682	B
and then and all they can do is is pay the minimum balance or not that you know	2682	B
exactly- oh	2682	B
nope they're not even touching it	2682	B
i know	2682	B
right	2682	B
yeah it's true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls	2682	B
oh yeah some people are they really are i mean if if they have if they know they have more- more on their limit	2682	B
he can't because_1 to him it's like money to him it's like a a loan almost in a sense and he can't bear to	2682	B
no i can't either	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
yeah	2682	B
i know	2682	B
oh my God	2682	B
um-hum	2682	B
yeah	2682	B
okay	2682	A
um i probably use my Discover card more than anything else	2682	A
uh no i really don't use too many credit cards i'm not fond of them i don't like using them	2682	A
but i've just gotten to the point where i'd rather carry that instead of cash	2682	A
but but the thing is i always carry it with my checkbook so if i have i just pay for it with my check instead of	2682	A
i think i've only ever used my credit card maybe three or four times	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
oh	2682	A
yeah	2682	A
wow	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
yeah uh-huh yeah	2682	A
with only only certain cards they accept though they don't accept all kinds of cards like they only accept the major cards	2682	A
um i don't know they do accept the Discover but i know they would accept like Visa Master Card	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
oh my	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
exactly	2682	A
exactly	2682	A
uh-huh	2682	A
exactly- yeah	2682	A
uh yes- yes definitely that see that if if i don't have the money in my checking account i will not charge it even if i have the charge	2682	A
i have to have that money before i'll charge it	2682	A
i refuse well i'm a college student and i'm a finance major	2682	A
so i just and um i don't i oh my gosh i probably- i have a Discover card	2682	A
i have an AT&T card but i don't use it because- i don't even know where it is i put it away like two years ago because_1 i thought if i don't see it i won't use it which is really good because_1 then	2682	A
i you know a lot of my friends have like outrageous phone bills but i don't have it because i don't use mine	2682	A
and um i know i have Montgomery Ward's i have a um a J C Penney's i have a Kaufman's you know i have a Fashion Bug i have a whole bunch of them	2682	A
and i just used my J C Penney card and it's a year old and that was the first time i've ever used it	2682	A
yeah i just i don't think to use them all the time and if i do use one i would rather use my Discover card one	2682	A
and they're getting to the point now too at the end of the year	2682	A
all the money that you've you've charged on they'll pay you i think it's ten percent back	2682	A
so you know i even got a couple dollars back	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
yeah	2682	A
exactly	2682	A
uh-huh	2682	A
uh-huh	2682	A
oh my gosh	2682	A
uh that's why i have it	2682	A
uh-huh	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
no huh-uh no	2682	A
that that yeah and being a college student i get um	2682	A
applications for them all the time i think uh once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if there's an annual fee if there's an annual fee i ditch it because i don't use them that often so it wouldn't even pay me to get it even if it was you know	2682	A
and uh my Discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it	2682	A
and now she buys everything with her Discover- Discover card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know and that way she's getting the interest on it too because_1 then at- at the end of the year they give her back her interest	2682	A
and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year	2682	A
so i mean she might spend three thousand but if you get thirty of it back you know that's that's still thirty dollars less	2682	A
exactly and she you know my mom's like that too she pays it off as soon as the bill comes	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
there's so there's so much fine print that i don't understand that i won't even try it	2682	A
yeah i just rely on my Mac card	2682	A
my Mac card just take it out of the bank	2682	A
uh-huh	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
yeah	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
yeah	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
that's good	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
yeah they usually i think they're usually pretty good about that	2682	A
uh i mean they they probably realized it was their mistake if if they really thought that it was not their mistake i think they would probably send you something proving that you actually did have it so	2682	A
yeah uh-huh i really- i'm i'm starting to use my credit card more like i said i'm a college student and the past two semesters i bought my books with it	2682	A
so and i run between two and three hundred dollars a semester with books	2682	A
so that's approximately between five and six hundred dollars that i put on it and i just keep thinking oh good i'm going to get that back i'm going to get a little bit back uh-huh	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
i	2682	A
i can't see that	2682	A
and when they do that all they're doing is paying the interest on it they're not even paying the principal	2682	A
i- i uh uh when- uh when i get to people like that i wish i- i think the company should just say uh we're not giving you any more until you pay this off	2682	A
i mean i realize that the company wants you to use it you know and extend it all the time they're making more money off you	2682	A
but i think they should have the the consumer the most interest you know	2682	A
it's like they're addicted to using their credit card or something	2682	A
um-hum	2682	A
oh my God	2682	A
i can't i- i can't do that	2682	A
i have like i said i have to i know- have to know that i have that money before i'll spend it	2682	A
so i- i- i don't	2682	A
i don't know of course my mom lives very she was she had twelve kids and of course she she watched her money all the time and i that was one good thing i did get off of her	2682	A
uh i don't mind spending my money as long as it's a necessity	2682	A
and if it's something i really really want but just to go out and start buying i'm not like that and that's something i got off of her and i'm	2682	A
some of the TV shows that uh i- i like are usually something that shows me something about a profession that i don't	2625	B
necessarily know how it operates and one of the earliest shows that uh taught me something was the old Bewitched shows when i was growing up	2625	B
i remember thinking so that's how the advertising game is played that's how they developed these things that's where commercials come from and i really didn't uh before that i think that was the very first show that i ever realized that on and then	2625	B
oh a little bit later i don't particularly like LA Law as a series but i do like some of the insights not so much into the legal profession but into the	2625	B
the fact that some of the well for instance some of the deals that are made by the DA you know you read about some of these things and it sounds really bad well you don't know what's gone on before	2625	B
um they had one case where uh the DA had been injured she had been hurt and you know was a little bit fearful of of making friends- uh any enemies at the moment	2625	B
so uh just little things like that makes well there's a human behind this little story you know that that -was was written up in the paper that DA cuts a bad deal	2625	B
as well as some of the the arguments on you know a guy gets arrested for DWI well depending upon	2625	B
what the guy says he's going to say in court regardless of the truth what the guy says he's going to say is you know is fifteen minutes later before they gave me the test and	2625	B
all these kinds of things and you could probably get away you know get off on it so they just plea bargained it out and is just done with it	2625	B
oh i- i those little things i guess i have to be reminded that there're there're so many details that just don't get out that you can't uh can't take the reported word	2625	B
for some of these things so i guess i like shows that that show me something some insights into other parts of of living that i don't always get exposed to how about yourself	2625	B
uh-hum	2625	B
right	2625	B
right	2625	B
right	2625	B
right	2625	B
hum	2625	B
huh that's interesting yeah yeah i i've seen Heat of the Night through off and on through out it's uh	2625	B
television career as it were and i i wonder if uh if they did that intentionally or if they just had uh	2625	B
whether they decided to do away with the the racial problem as the main thrust of it or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down somewhat that um	2625	B
quite possible that they wanted it to become more of the subtle problems that it is today as opposed to the the hitting over the head type problems that it was then	2625	B
and uh they they have uh uh pretty good	2625	B
yeah that's true that's true	2625	B
didn't get the	2625	B
right	2625	B
yeah there're there're just starting to rerun those uh All in the Family down here on a particular on a major station and it's	2625	B
uh i never did like it particularly and i've watched a couple of them_1 off and on uh just to get a feel for what what was being said then but it	2625	B
uh the i i don't know it's- it's it's a pretty simplistic deal and i mean they they pound whatever message they're going to say over and over and that's about the end of it so	2625	B
i don't know if i would have liked it when it was current and and being discussed maybe it would have been a little better but uh	2625	B
no the uh the All in the Family reruns that are showing- showing now	2625	B
they they really take whatever point they're wanting to make they they reiterate it over and over you know it's as if the the intelligence level of the people that watch this or something other they handle over a wide you know range of	2625	B
of uh topics but uh the uh i don't know maybe it would have been better the first time through when it was more	2625	B
uh when the public was talking about it you know sit around the table and talk about the this that and the other but some of the issues seemed a little out dated but of course that's what reruns are for and	2625	B
right	2625	B
right	2625	B
right going another generation's problems	2625	B
what to latch on to	2625	B
i don't know well i hear one of my {kiddos} coming in the door so i'll wind this one up and go see what they need	2625	B
maybe we'll cross paths again later	2625	B
um bye	2625	B
right	2625	A
right	2625	A
right	2625	A
yeah	2625	A
sure	2625	A
right i	2625	A
i don't know i've i like- tend to like a lot of the old uh	2625	A
older TV shows like uh for instance there there's i love watching old Twilight Zones and uh they've-	2625	A
they've been there's a station- station here that runs mostly syndicated things and that's one thing i like to catch on late at night is the old Twilight Zones but uh	2625	A
for TV that's out right now i i the shows i like to see for one reason or another that i've been	2625	A
catching um Matlock and Tuesday nights for some- some are i guess are my TV night and i like to see uh Matlock and then In the Heat of the Night uh	2625	A
are two shows that that i like to see after seeing the the television show In the Heat of the Night i wanted i haven't never seen the movie but uh i think i'd like to check out that movie sometime it's uh	2625	A
i don't know it's just kind of interesting they have great characters in that uh TV show and it's interesting from i just saw the pilot to it	2625	A
oh a week or two ago and it was a special two hour thing but it was the first like- like i said a pilot and uh	2625	A
the characters in it were the white police officers when the black- the black guy from Philadelphia went down there were much more bigoted and more the villains	2625	A
in that episode and now over the time in the television show they're all very much uh uh	2625	A
not- not bigoted- or very more- more- you know more in the twentieth century now let's say or or very {unbigoted} and they even have added uh this uh other	2625	A
black police officer to the cast so it's interesting how they kind of got away from the original- i guess the premise of the movie as well was the problems that that uh	2625	A
he had with the police officers and now it's more concentrated on the problems they have in the small town in the south and it it's kind of interesting because it's supposed to be this little tiny town in down in	2625	A
uh down south but uh i live in this little teeny town up here in upstate New York and it's not too much different so people got a lot to learn everywhere	2625	A
right	2625	A
right i i don't know either i don't	2625	A
right	2625	A
right	2625	A
sure	2625	A
it's a lot different seeing Carroll O'Connor in that role than uh Archie Bunker it's like	2625	A
and maybe a little more versatile than anybody ever gave him credit for	2625	A
but uh	2625	A
uh	2625	A
right	2625	A
course the this is The Heat of the Night isn't it	2625	A
oh oh the All in the Family right right right	2625	A
right	2625	A
sure	2625	A
right when is relevant or	2625	A
yeah well you've got old Meathead there and the rest of the gang at the where Meathead and and Sally- Sally Struthers there with the um the the liberals	2625	A
the the supposedly correct view at the time and then uh the Archie Bunker with his uh antiquated uh the rednecked uh	2625	A
ideas i don't know it the old meets new head on and whatever but now it's all old so	2625	A
you could have another one you could have a new TV show with uh Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers in with their kids moving in and uh	2625	A
yeah and have them be uh oh i don't even know yuppies are passe now i'm not even sure what uh	2625	A
yeah	2625	A
okay well it was nice talking to you	2625	A
all right bye-bye	2625	A
yes	2645	B
well let's see what kind of hobbies do i have i guess uh i it's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing i enjoy playing basketball and and basically all kinds of sports and uh excuse me	2645	B
no not not really um no i i'm really not too creative well i uh you know around with my hands and things like that i leave that more up to my mom	2645	B
oh yeah	2645	B
oh well let's hope that you you you aren't employed- employed by that craft for too long	2645	B
uh-huh what- what-	2645	B
what kind of time frame is it uh looking for the uh different shifts up there	2645	B
is it uh basically i had read that they're just looking at relocating them_1 all to McKinney is it Texas	2645	B
oh wow	2645	B
uh-huh	2645	B
wow how about that yeah that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney	2645	B
how about that well that's uh that's unfortunate is there many- many other are you in the defense	2645	B
is it uh it- many other corporations in the area	2645	B
well i'm sure with the new uh awarding- contract awarding i i think it went to Lockheed didn't it	2645	B
that uh i hear they're hiring all over the place for that	2645	B
oh really	2645	B
now is that actually just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs	2645	B
how about that	2645	B
um-hum	2645	B
were you in the uh computer operations or in the actual uh manufacturing	2645	B
right yeah that's why i was in the DSEG down here in Plano also	2645	B
am i still employed by TI no i took a leave of of TI back in November	2645	B
actually December was my first month away from them	2645	B
exempt	2645	B
it uh uh fortunately i guess for myself it wasn't uh it was purely by my own choice	2645	B
it wasn't uh there was no incentive for myself to leave but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it	2645	B
no i should have taken the the the you know uh option when that was there but it was just i missed it by a couple months	2645	B
but you know what can one do i'm just happy to still to have a job	2645	B
yeah i am kind of happy with it it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as- as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system so i was in the computer operations	2645	B
it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out	2645	B
um-hum	2645	B
right	2645	B
um-hum well the the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that that is more in the support of the manufacturing and there's lots and lots of companies that have	2645	B
maybe- maybe not in the defense- the defense area but manufacturing in general	2645	B
uh-huh well that's great that's good	2645	B
uh-huh	2645	B
sure yeah sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table	2645	B
it may be a blessing in disguise	2645	B
i know a number of people who are uh {surplused} and they're just actually what the positions that they've found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside	2645	B
exactly	2645	B
uh-huh well i'm sure it's just with the the the the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide- decide on a pass	2645	B
uh-huh well would you like to be there	2645	B
uh-huh what-	2645	B
sure	2645	B
uh-huh well just take the day	2645	B
well actually uh the the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice	2645	B
oh that's a beautiful place	2645	B
uh-huh	2645	B
that's just fantastic down there take it more as a this is your opportunity to do whatever you want pick out where you want to live and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do	2645	B
um-hum um-hum	2645	B
sure	2645	B
um-hum yeah that's a it it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it	2645	B
uh-huh	2645	B
uh-huh well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something if you don't like it shoot move on to something else that's the way i've uh looked at the whole thing here i'll take a chance if i don't like it i'll go someplace else do something different	2645	B
five years	2645	B
yeah	2645	B
yeah i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes	2645	B
um-hum	2645	B
well that's good you've got a good attitude about it	2645	B
um-hum	2645	B
right there you go	2645	B
that's the way to do it	2645	B
there you go that's the thing to do	2645	B
that's much funner than doing any kind of job	2645	B
that'll work out just fine	2645	B
all right nice talking to you good-bye	2645	B
so the general topic is hobbies let's hear about your hobbies	2645	A
any handicrafts any handicrafts	2645	A
so i i think i'm developing a new handicraft i think it'll become resume writing	2645	A
uh yeah i i hate to think about it and and i'm getting rather good at reading want ads yeah it it	2645	A
i who knows	2645	A
no all means about fifteen to twenty percent of	2645	A
of oh i'm sure the numbers somewhat classified but it's on the internal news and the news services so it's approximately six fifty so	2645	A
ten percent of six fifty sixty five and twenty percent would be one thirty	2645	A
yeah that's possible	2645	A
oh yes that's here	2645	A
uh	2645	A
i saw 7-Eleven that was hiring	2645	A
yes	2645	A
yeah uh no Apple's coming to town and and that has some opportunities and uh and	2645	A
Colorado Springs specifically yes	2645	A
and uh and uh MCI's coming if if telemarketing is your bag personally i'd rather die a slow painful death but	2645	A
uh i'm a defense worker a government tool control specialist	2645	A
are you still employed	2645	A
oh	2645	A
exempt or hourly oh yes	2645	A
oh so you didn't even get the severance package	2645	A
so are you happy with what you're doing now	2645	A
yeah	2645	A
good good well hasn't been a long time TI or i i'm	2645	A
significantly shaken by the situation	2645	A
but not devastated	2645	A
tell you the truth i'm i'm i'm not really worried	2645	A
and and i seem rather happy about it most of the time just just to know	2645	A
what's	2645	A
possibilities are you know what might happen	2645	A
but	2645	A
still in all	2645	A
it feels funny	2645	A
so	2645	A
despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now	2645	A
uh situational i i doubt i'll be here in six months	2645	A
i	2645	A
all things being equal yes	2645	A
but or or even somewhere better but	2645	A
God this is much better than west Texas	2645	A
but then they they tell me hell is much better than west Texas	2645	A
i my little brother lives in Austin right now	2645	A
goes to UT	2645	A
i	2645	A
see that's the problem for the last many years i've more or less let them direct what i want to do and where i want to go	2645	A
and just kind of go with the punches	2645	A
and now i feel lost	2645	A
oh i've had job offers	2645	A
but	2645	A
i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave	2645	A
and that	2645	A
oh so had you been with TI long when you changed huh	2645	A
well there's a noticeable difference there i've been with them sixteen	2645	A
actually seventeen now and	2645	A
oh yeah momentum is uh driving force in our lives	2645	A
but	2645	A
so yeah i'm looking as as a opportunity	2645	A
and and i'm looking at it as	2645	A
a change	2645	A
and i'm looking at it as	2645	A
as	2645	A
an adventure	2645	A
and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then	2645	A
huh how about we end this	2645	A
nice talking to you	2645	A
bye	2645	A
hi	2618	A
you don't at all	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
or too much of it yeah yeah you need	2618	A
oh uh-huh	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
yeah i haven't been up there um but i understand they've got a nice pool and that's my favorite form of exercise is swimming	2618	A
really	2618	A
oh yeah most of my- my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old	2618	A
and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration- exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it's amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and	2618	A
and to a five year old they're they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds one it's uh it's a brand new exciting activity for her	2618	A
um-hum it really is	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
oh yeah isn't it great	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
well that's neat my uh my husband was uh was a boy scout and he uh actually went very far in the boy scouts and he was in The Order of the Arrow and he absolutely	2618	A
um you know the earth is is part of him	2618	A
and he is part of it and i think that's a real important thing and we we enjoy going camping we haven't yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because	2618	A
to them uh or to the five year old the two year old would freak out about it but she wouldn't quite get totally unnerved but the five year old still has a fear of spiders	2618	A
and i'm afraid that if she woke up one with her we would have to pack up and come home so we've primarily done our camping by cabin up at Turner Falls up in Oklahoma	2618	A
isn't that a beautiful place	2618	A
well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we we you know we'd never seen one	2618	A
or she had never seen one we my husband and i had but she- we'd never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time it was you know removed from us by probably five or six feet	2618	A
so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
i think not yeah- i think it was you know being in a new place being kind of out of out of sorts and everything all combined but	2618	A
both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn't um really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know	2618	A
well	2618	A
yeah we have a	2618	A
that's kind of how we feel about it we can't you know there's	2618	A
there's- there's- there's things that uh the only thing that is forever is the earth well we hope it's forever yeah and uh and you know therefore	2618	A
uh the you know the girls can learn things in school about everything that is temporary but as far as really knowing the earth there's no other way to really learn it but to experience it	2618	A
and we really have a great time with it i'm sure that's the way that you felt with your boys	2618	A
oh and Florida's absolutely wonderful for that i understand i've i've never lived there	2618	A
oh with Walt Disney World and	2618	A
um	2618	A
by night	2618	A
they were trying to turn it too much into a business	2618	A
oh that's good we've uh not been brave enough yet to brave that trip with these with the two small children i mean you know in the car	2618	A
it's it's uh it's you know getting up to Turner Falls or uh up to Lake Murray or something is about_1 as far as we've really tried to go in a car we have gone down and uh	2618	A
uh gone down to the uh New Braunfels uh San well we were headed down to Sea World in San Antonio	2618	A
and uh we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way but um you know that's that's pretty much as far as we've tried with little ones	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
oh um-hum	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
and no reason to be	2618	A
and that's that's not terribly far	2618	A
yeah yeah	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
it's just off the interstate that goes through Hot Springs	2618	A
okay	2618	A
well that wouldn't even be a very far drive	2618	A
i'm not i- i ought to look into it uh because_1 we were kind of	2618	A
entertaining- entertaining the thought of taking a uh you know like just a five or six day trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer	2618	A
and i	2618	A
uh-huh	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
um-hum	2618	A
i probably wouldn't and i've lived here all of my life	2618	A
oh yes i have i have been to Tyler that was one place we went when i was a child	2618	A
we've not taken our children though	2618	A
uh-huh	2618	A
Texarkana uh-huh	2618	A
we ought to head out	2618	A
we uh	2618	A
um-hum ah	2618	A
right	2618	A
yeah	2618	A
yeah well i certainly will	2618	A
Jack it's been real it's been real uh informative for me to talk with you and i- i certainly enjoyed it	2618	A
okay	2618	A
uh-huh it sure is	2618	A
i don't have any Italian heritage my- my mother actually chose it because of Gina	2618	A
well- this is going to be very boring- boring because i don't	2618	B
no and uh unfortunately it shows i uh	2618	B
i'm supposed to i'm way overweight	2618	B
but uh i've had a problem with uh high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctor is trying to get my blood pressure under control	2618	B
before i start in any exercising	2618	B
so anyway i did join the uh	2618	B
uh the Texans	2618	B
up at uh	2618	B
uh Springcreek	2618	B
and i've been up there a few times	2618	B
but didn't accomplish too much because i just run down too quick	2618	B
uh that would have to be mine i hate exercising it's so boring	2618	B
uh i would much prefer to like walk through the woods	2618	B
uh-huh	2618	B
isn't it amazing	2618	B
well we um	2618	B
back when my- my i have four sons they're all grown now and and two of them are married with children of their own but	2618	B
when they were just uh pre teenagers we um	2618	B
we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping	2618	B
and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the tents and everything else and and pretty much roughed it	2618	B
sleeping on the ground and all	2618	B
and uh i like to think that my children my sons learned a lot about uh the outdoors uh uh	2618	B
uh being self-sustaining	2618	B
uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd uh they'd exist-	2618	B
exist somehow	2618	B
uh-huh	2618	B
oh uh-huh well- okay that is understandable	2618	B
oh yes i'm very familiar with it very beautiful place	2618	B
i've been up there several times	2618	B
oh what a shame	2618	B
well good i'm glad to hear that about_1 the only thing uh i might suggest is	2618	B
uh do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isn't frightened	2618	B
and uh and that that that the the nightmare i'm sure was just a a freak	2618	B
i'll bet it wouldn't happen again	2618	B
sure	2618	B
well that you couldn't pick a better way of doing it	2618	B
with your family	2618	B
and and you're- you're certainly all getting an education while you're	2618	B
doing this exercise	2618	B
as far as we're concerned	2618	B
um-hum	2618	B
oh definitely definitely it was a learning experience uh	2618	B
now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of Florida	2618	B
oh yes yes yell they used to be but now they're trying to really	2618	B
put it to the the the the uh	2618	B
visitors i think they're doing a very stupid thing	2618	B
well they charge extra now they there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the uh motels and hotels	2618	B
so they are are uh you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they suddenly- and suddenly the the foundling fathers of uh of Florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks	2618	B
people were going elsewhere for uh their vacations	2618	B
exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry	2618	B
uh yeah- i can appreciate that	2618	B
um-hum	2618	B
well the the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and run	2618	B
now uh i'm alone now myself and and uh i	2618	B
i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to uh going in a motor home	2618	B
well the fact i live in it and there's just my dog and i now my dog is a wonderful traveler but i do have to stop for her quite frequently	2618	B
and it works out fine i mean i stop i'm never in a hurry to get anywhere	2618	B
like	2618	B
it takes me two days to get to Memphis	2618	B
no it's uh it's about an eight or nine hour drive really	2618	B
but uh i make it in two days because i- i don't push it	2618	B
oh definitely oh absolutely incidentally oh i can't remember the name of that place there's a beautiful park up there	2618	B
and they do have a uh uh oh sort of a hotel a lodge a lodge that's what it is	2618	B
and it's just off the interstate and the kids would love it because they have playgrounds for the children and all and they have a uh several nature trails	2618	B
uh it's just below Hot Springs	2618	B
oh	2618	B
it's lake something	2618	B
um-hum	2618	B
well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the Texas	2618	B
welcome bureaus	2618	B
and ask them for their literature on the- the uh state national parks in the state of Texas	2618	B
and you'll you'll get a collection from them you wouldn't believe there were so many parks in the state	2618	B
well it it there there are so many for instance- have you ever been out to Tyler State Park	2618	B
all	2618	B
all right you	2618	B
there's a place to take them_1 and uh	2618	B
oh good heavens up there just this side of Texoma- Texoma not Texoma uh Texarkana	2618	B
there are three or four state parks up there	2618	B
and they're all great and and again there's the	2618	B
nature trails	2618	B
for your exercising	2618	B
we almost forgot our subject of the day there	2618	B
but be sure and stop at one of those Texas bureaus- tourist bureaus and get their literature	2618	B
well it's been my pleasure Gina- uh Gina Gina is that with a G	2618	B
that's- that's- that's uh uh Italian heritage isn't it	2618	B
huh okay	2657	A
well i don't know if i know anything or not but i've i've got some opinions on it see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at don't know anything	2657	A
well uh i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective	2657	A
uh i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed	2657	A
and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a more- far more disadvantaged viewpoint	2657	A
uh	2657	A
i personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though	2657	A
but they have i read somewhere	2657	A
and i'm i'm out on a limb here some type of college uh	2657	A
volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the uh	2657	A
lower income brackets of the United States have you ever heard about that one	2657	A
oh really	2657	A
and this is money that she's borrowed to- for her college education	2657	A
but she got credits for it	2657	A
that's very interesting	2657	A
hum	2657	A
yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and it's it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really really	2657	A
have have a disadvantage that we don't understand because we're in the Metroplex	2657	A
right you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient	2657	A
but we could find one we wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that	2657	A
so i- i can see the advantage to that one	2657	A
the Peace Corps itself is really uh uh dying out isn't it	2657	A
it's still in existence	2657	A
i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm	2657	A
uh dig their own wells set up their schools	2657	A
yes they it's not	2657	A
a program to teach them to use the American money it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant	2657	A
and yes you're right i think it's a sixties program i think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal	2657	A
right right um	2657	A
i think i- i- i i've	2657	A
singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're they're pretty good	2657	A
along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good	2657	A
but there's a	2657	A
mandatory just like like the draft no	2657	A
every time you have-	2657	A
they could buy their way out	2657	A
right you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but	2657	A
i'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out	2657	A
can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults	2657	A
can they go in there and can anyone	2657	A
go into	2657	A
well out of the Kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think Bangladesh would have been a good example	2657	A
or some some really desperate situation and teach them_1 to farm and teach them_1 and doesn't do any good	2657	A
i don't know that it does	2657	A
i- i i don't know that um	2657	A
if you step back from the current issue and look at it	2657	A
more intellectually	2657	A
there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out	2657	A
you know we're losing certain races of people there are people now	2657	A
that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people	2657	A
that are endangered or obsolete	2657	A
and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out there's a German word for it that's elegant but i never can remember what it was uh	2657	A
but but they're they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment	2657	A
essentially	2657	A
um and	2657	A
uh one of the quick examples is the aborigines	2657	A
uh when we were in Australia	2657	A
uh sad little things	2657	A
uh i felt sorry for them_1	2657	A
because their society isn't there anymore and their belief system and all- all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone	2657	A
essentially	2657	A
and they're just kind of	2657	A
more like a side show than anything else and that's sad but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people and i that- don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either	2657	A
so i i'm wondering if the Peace Corps is really an effective tool	2657	A
good point we've got enough without leave- without a passport there's plenty	2657	A
yes i think we ought to worry about our own species	2657	A
i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses	2657	A
that's the last thing you want to do	2657	A
yeah that's exactly it	2657	A
they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic	2657	A
right	2657	A
no we're not i don't think i think that's more realistic than going making them_1 go in the Peace Corps	2657	A
i think that's a lot more realistic	2657	A
uh	2657	A
i i think that we should be spending more time and and again i don't think the the Peace Corps is is as successful now simply because	2657	A
it's not	2657	A
it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore	2657	A
uh we've got plenty	2657	A
in fact we've got far too many	2657	A
you're in uh what Flower Mound-	2657	A
i was that's exactly what i was going to ask you have you ever have have you been downtown recently-	2657	A
i don't know how much i know about this subject	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
okay go ahead	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
that's true	2657	B
um me either i	2657	B
i went to college and then started working and then got married and	2657	B
no i haven't i know that uh my sister i have a twin sister and when she graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south Texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in	2657	B
a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever	2657	B
um-hum	2657	B
if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live	2657	B
yeah she only taught there one year but i	2657	B
um-hum	2657	B
and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and and he was um	2657	B
some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh	2657	B
uh i mean it's a nursing home or something like that so you know if if i think that that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping	2657	B
people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
as far as getting- yeah getting doctors and all that kind of stuff yeah	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
um-hum	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
i really don't know that much about it you know i i i think of the Peace Corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when but yeah and don't they go into other countries and stuff	2657	B
um-hum	2657	B
things that make them- yeah make them more self-supporting yeah	2657	B
right yeah	2657	B
but it definitely would give	2657	B
a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them_1 that they want to see	2657	B
what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it	2657	B
um-hum	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i don't know that that would work if if somebody's	2657	B
was didn't really want to be there and	2657	B
didn't have yeah i mean there'd be loopholes just like there is in anything else	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
um-hum	2657	B
um-hum	2657	B
right yeah	2657	B
yeah um-hum	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
yeah really-	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
well	2657	B
and here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and	2657	B
help people in that area or people in the United States	2657	B
there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are social- are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be	2657	B
half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility	2657	B
to um help these people you know and not- i'm not saying just give them_1 money but i mean because_1 they have to be taught to be yeah i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people	2657	B
money or	2657	B
what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um	2657	B
more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean because_1 if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves i mean	2657	B
i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean it's	2657	B
true yeah	2657	B
yeah	2657	B
Flower Mound yeah	2657	B
so we're a little	2657	B
farther- you know farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing	2657	B
uh yeah i am yeah yeah i've been uh	2692	B
i uh it is Friday yeah that's for sure well uh i guess i'm trying to think the last thing i did to a car um	2692	B
oh wow okay	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
yeah	2692	B
sure	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
right right	2692	B
yeah yeah	2692	B
right	2692	B
right	2692	B
yeah yeah	2692	B
really	2692	B
yeah that's that's the aggravating thing yeah i i try to do as much as i can i uh i grew up on farm so i've got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude and uh oh i've done	2692	B
i've done various things i've got an i've got an eighty three T Bird and i've i've changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that um	2692	B
i guess the last thing i took	2692	B
to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection it didn't it didn't quite pass so we had to have uh that's uh that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it	2692	B
they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it and uh	2692	B
yeah yeah i've uh i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess but you know that's it's partially because i can work on them that's uh that's that's that's a big part of my decision but uh yeah we ran into some problems with uh	2692	B
having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh	2692	B
and they had left the uh oil filter- uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that little- little things like that that really start to aggravate you that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff	2692	B
um-hum	2692	B
sure	2692	B
sure that's right	2692	B
sure yeah	2692	B
any anything that gets that that's in uh	2692	B
gets to be an an assembly line type operation you're you're always risking that if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get you- you miss that overlap sometimes and and and they miss things yeah i've i've had a hard time	2692	B
finding anybody i can trust like like you say it	2692	B
my old transmissions things like that i'm obviously i'm not going to i'm not going to tear apart a	2692	B
automatic transmission try rebuild it	2692	B
but uh it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
okay	2692	B
yeah	2692	B
oh yeah	2692	B
yeah	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
sure sure	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
well yeah that that the biggest you know that's the three biggest things to me you know i- i number one you've got to have the tools around if you don't have the the special tools or	2692	B
well any more the the testers that you know i i don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage you know so obviously if it starts	2692	B
my car start missing or something like that that- it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that but	2692	B
then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a Chilton's book or something like that and get an idea of how to go about it but	2692	B
you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so	2692	B
just- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart	2692	B
that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my T Bird	2692	B
that is got to be the worst location for it and and the only reason i did it i	2692	B
yeah yeah the the only ones i've ever heard good good things about are are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out yeah but but uh	2692	B
i- i had i had taken this in to have it done originally and uh	2692	B
oh it it was it was tremendous- well it was about seven hours labor so it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so	2692	B
and they looked it over and they they	2692	B
they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they	2692	B
yeah yeah- yeah and it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit so uh they they did a little patch on it	2692	B
and it last- it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and it- it's a matter tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not	2692	B
uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me it was about a week before i finally got through	2692	B
yeah oh really no this this was the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings	2692	B
yeah it it's i i've never heard a good story about uh	2692	B
yeah	2692	B
right	2692	B
okay	2692	B
yeah	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
sure	2692	B
you bet well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh it the the pipe wasn't busted	2692	B
but the it wasn't soldered in good enough and it had it had broken loose enough to where	2692	B
if it got hot	2692	B
and and not- just normal driving didn't do it but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside	2692	B
it was real aggravating but uh i i couldn't	2692	B
even- even a week's a week's time is is- is worth a whole lot less than four than four hundred dollars to me you know than to have somebody else do it	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
yeah	2692	B
right	2692	B
that's true	2692	B
uh-huh	2692	B
yeah	2692	B
well yeah and- and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know if you can if she can get yourself out of a bad situation	2692	B
without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait it it it can it can save a lot of time and trouble	2692	B
are you a TIer	2692	A
oh good	2692	A
yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at one o'clock on Friday	2692	A
i i i do it a lot i have i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid	2692	A
uh	2692	A
so and my father and brother were in it and and my brother's still in it and i had periods when i didn't do anything but in the last ten years i've	2692	A
uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and	2692	A
uh uh i just essentially do it all i don't know uh	2692	A
uh if there's anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a M E besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess that's diversion uh	2692	A
i i've i've tried a few groups uh you know where you i can recommend it for people to take their cars Like i think Sears is probably the best place because i've heard when i used to go there	2692	A
and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didn't take it that much but what i heard them tell other people was always right	2692	A
you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my car off for tires or something like that	2692	A
and so i respect they seem to actually have mechanics there	2692	A
i was pretty impressed with Western Auto	2692	A
but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didn't like it So i'm just doing it all myself i i	2692	A
you had to do it yeah right	2692	A
oh	2692	A
uh-huh	2692	A
uh-huh	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
uh-huh	2692	A
oh yeah	2692	A
well you like Fords apparently huh	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
really	2692	A
my goodness	2692	A
yeah i wonder always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at TI why we don't inspect i'm in facilities why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh	2692	A
we always fix things and put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there	2692	A
that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an inspector- inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever you know i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
no no i don't either i don't either yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
you need to really uh i i do uh a lot of the simple things i i think i do most of the things better than the average person you you have Fords and i i uh i have three Chevys which	2692	A
i worked my way into having the same engine i don't know how long i'm i like a V8 and i'm i'm sold- sold on small block Chevy V8s and i i bought one car new and i almost accidentally	2692	A
got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a used- a used car with the same engine	2692	A
well then the next- the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine so i buy filters you know three or four at a time and essentially the engines are different you the cars are different years but the same Chevy V8	2692	A
and the part the carburetors is the same almost everything is the same the the course is two are eighties and one eighty six you know so you can learn a lot that way i there's no way i could i could fix every car in the world you know	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
right	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
i think they're all bad really they're	2692	A
uh-huh	2692	A
is that right	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
what did they want to charge you for it	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
this is your little water uh heater in there for the uh the heat inside	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little Buick i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah	2692	A
maybe you're right maybe you're right i it's been a long time since i took one out	2692	A
course	2692	A
i broke mine you know so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it i don't know whether you did yours	2692	A
not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off	2692	A
very gingerly because if you you know pull on that and i've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time	2692	A
but i broke one on my on my Buick and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off	2692	A
oh really yeah	2692	A
It it spread out yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
sometimes if you're a tinkerer you luck out My wife's	2692	A
uh Chevy uh it was a Caprice air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in	2692	A
and i went out there for five minutes and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by it's not the evaporator the big filter on one side	2692	A
i just pushed that in and i heard it click	2692	A
and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity	2692	A
and you have enough knowledge to check things out i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it And i know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot i've got girls daughters and	2692	A
i've always said i'd teach them And my my one daughter was fairly interested And i really haven't gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things And i'm going to do that i i told my daughters in college this year	2692	A
i said This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car i said	2692	A
so you can learn the basics you know	2692	A
yeah	2692	A
right	2692	A
i have the there's one expression i don't like uh	2692	A
the country expression you know if it ain't if it ain't broke don't fix it	2692	A
i don't know what the the last thing i've done far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i haven't gotten really involved in anything	2615	A
uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile	2615	A
yeah i know what you mean	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
they're fuel injected and so there's	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
no there's no way somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh	2615	A
the guys average guys can't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
absolutely	2615	A
yeah i used to have uh	2615	A
Chevy van it was a short van that had the the three fifty in it	2615	A
and basically it it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it and you could get to it to work on it	2615	A
yeah the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it	2615	A
well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together	2615	A
oh yeah	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel	2615	A
well that's true	2615	A
i think the only- closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop uh when i was in high school and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically	2615	A
and they were nearly all all diesel but as far as cars i've never never been involved with them	2615	A
well yeah- yeah and you can- you can get to them	2615	A
well i	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
i'm	2615	A
i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why One of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at i sure- i don't know if it's still	2615	A
uh limited like it was i don't notice it probably because i don't huh	2615	A
yeah i don't i don't notice but maybe because i'm not looking for it yeah	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
but you you got the you got the three fifty in the van	2615	A
yeah that's what i like because they've got plenty of power and uh	2615	A
if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that uh Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes	2615	A
i'm convinced that the small V eight like the the Mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the Chevy two eighty threes	2615	A
were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers but they had enough power to pull all this weight And the four cylinders just don't have it	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
i think those guys- those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but	2615	A
oh yeah	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
yeah that's kind of like	2615	A
the the first well my first car was a fifty six Mustang and uh over the years uh all i had a uh Dodge pickup several years ago and uh i can't remember the size of the engine it was a three O seven or something like that	2615	A
but uh i remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things Now you open the hood and it's scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to	2615	A
my dad's got a new um i guess it's an eighty nine or ninety uh Chrysler something or other it's one those transverse mounted V sixes front wheel drive	2615	A
and uh he was showing it to me and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front And i said well where are the other three	2615	A
and he had never really thought about it And he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off Yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall	2615	A
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them	2615	A
right	2615	A
yeah the {antismog} pumps	2615	A
and all that stuff loads the motor down	2615	A
so it's trying to push the weight plus	2615	A
have all this drain on it from all sorts of	2615	A
belts and things	2615	A
but that's one good thing i've got a uh eight ninety uh	2615	A
Chevy Blazer now and it's got one uh belt on it a serpentine belt	2615	A
yeah	2615	A
i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an Olds Tornado that i think's got six belts on the sucker And i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh	2615	A
i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where	2615	A
oh man	2615	A
you bet everything else's got to come off first well it's a pleasure meeting you	2615	A
uh i've got uh five stickers here from TI so i guess i've done probably uh i'd say seven or eight of them	2615	A
yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if if it's tapering off or or what is i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so	2615	A
people or either not or maybe they're burned out or they're through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking bye	2615	A
yeah i had a similar thing that i've worked on cars ever since i was uh a kid and that was some time ago but i've gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh	2615	B
oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or	2615	B
or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that	2615	B
oh yeah yeah basically that's it	2615	B
yeah i've got uh an eighty four Chevy van that's uh a one ton van with a camper conversion on it	2615	B
it's got the the the good old three fifty standard engine in it regular gas engine and that engine i understand i can i can actually work on that engine	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
uh-hum	2615	B
right	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it	2615	B
well that's true that you're right you know by the time you've finally got down to it i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went	2615	B
a few years ago i had an Oldsmobile diesel and uh the uh it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and uh i bought it when we were living in Lubbock when i came back here i brought the car back here and uh	2615	B
i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and uh the injector pump went bad so i	2615	B
found an outfit down here to rebuild it and uh i- reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time	2615	B
uh well if you know diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers	2615	B
and uh	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your	2615	B
thumb and the yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with	2615	B
what the availability	2615	B
you mean the diesel availability	2615	B
yeah well i'd bought uh a GMC diesel pickup	2615	B
and uh loved that thing you know i really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really	2615	B
needed and it was the van that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the Chevy van but uh i sure enjoyed it	2615	B
yeah yeah the three fifty regular gas engine	2615	B
uh-huh	2615	B
yeah well	2615	B
uh-huh	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
think that little the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty in fifty five i think was two sixty five something like that little	2615	B
you know not a hold lot more than the than the six cylinder that i think was like about for about two thirty five or something but uh	2615	B
they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was uh the same block you know just just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more yeah	2615	B
well that was uh that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up	2615	B
the two little cars i've got now	2615	B
bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple years ago and and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
the friend of ours over here he's got uh sixty five or sixty six Mustang with the six cylinder	2615	B
and uh i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road it's amazing	2615	B
you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess	2615	B
oh yeah	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the	2615	B
you know like well actually i guess here within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it the three O five was that that V eight that they put in the the three quarter and and half ton van and it had all the air pump and uh	2615	B
uh i don't know all that all that stuff and all the {antismog} stuff and uh boy that was uh really a mess back under there under the in that van	2615	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2615	B
oh it's that one that's about uh what an inch and a half wide got a bunch of groves in it	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
yeah	2615	B
yeah it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck you know when one of them breaks it's not the outside one it's it's the it's usually that power steering belt or something that's way back in there everything's got to come off	2615	B
yeah and we'll uh how many times have you done this now is this	2615	B
yeah i hadn't uh hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last uh this is the first one in a week or so and	2615	B
if it's	2615	B
winding down or what	2615	B
finding a taker	2615	B
yeah well	2615	B
okay all righty bye-bye	2615	B
uh yeah	2664	A
um not really	2664	A
not really i've uh	2664	A
i uh i've	2664	A
i'm forty years old now so i've uh	2664	A
yeah we uh we we grew up with the same music and	2664	A
i just uh i heard song- i heard uh what they call around here they have a thing they call uh oh what are they uh it's a spoof on the song and the song was um	2664	A
you you've heard of the song Dance to the Music you remember that	2664	A
okay well they did a uh a uh twisted tune they call it and the twisted tune was Rap Isn't Music	2664	A
and they they sang here Rap Isn't Music to the tune of you know Dance to the Music it was pretty funny	2664	A
yeah	2664	A
i'm	2664	A
that's true that's true now if you can just uh make a rhyme and sometimes not even a good one you know you	2664	A
and you don't even need a band because you can just use that uh crazy little radio to uh keep the time for you	2664	A
oh God yes	2664	A
i	2664	A
i mean i- i can tolerate a lot of different things and i can you know i can tolerate a certain amount of of rap but if i have to listen to two songs in a row i'm ready to shoot somebody	2664	A
yeah that that must be it	2664	A
um my i get a real kick out of the uh these remakes of the old songs that we grew up with	2664	A
yeah it makes you think that all the uh singer song writers are running out of	2664	A
you know things to write about	2664	A
um-hum	2664	A
run D	2664	A
yeah	2664	A
it'll never be elevator music let's put it that way	2664	A
yeah i know and you you'll you'll never hear it in the uh	2664	A
in the restaurants and uh	2664	A
yeah	2664	A
i've i've found that as i've gotten older that that some of even the hard rock has started to to bother me and it	2664	A
uh no no from this this new hard rock	2664	A
um-hum	2664	A
yeah me either	2664	A
yeah but it's fun to prove your age um i- i get the biggest kick out of my i have uh two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old living at home and uh they	2664	A
they hear one of these old remakes of a song and oh that's just a beautiful song and i'm like that's a remake they that that song's twenty years old	2664	A
oh no it just came out that's called music	2664	A
well we've got uh four cases of albums downstairs and then we've got another case of	2664	A
oh yes we do we've got some songs that will that will totally blow my children away um we've the problem we've been having is that we have a uh an old Fisher system and can't find a needle for it you know because they're not pressing	2664	A
yeah	2664	A
horse and buggy	2664	A
yeah so i'm i'm hoping that we can locate one soon and once i do locate a source i'm going to buy about twelve of them_1	2664	A
um i've heard of it	2664	A
um-hum	2664	A
great i'll try that out i really uh i really do want to dig out the old LP's	2664	A
yeah because_1 i've i've got everything from uh God back when i've got all of Bill Cosby's original comedy albums	2664	A
and	2664	A
i've even got Old Silver Throat that's the one album that he sang on	2664	A
yeah he's horrible- he horrible singer i listened to it one time that was it	2664	A
and i've i've got stuff	2664	A
ah	2664	A
all right	2664	A
yeah i know well it's been nice talking to you too	2664	A
all right you too bye-bye	2664	A
it's about this rap crap	2664	B
uh it uh uh do you get it	2664	B
oh so am i so we're talking the same language	2664	B
oh yeah	2664	B
yeah indeed	2664	B
and to the music	2664	B
wow that's terrific	2664	B
well i just don't get you know like i remember when we were growing up how you know the Beatles and and and and and Presley- uh you know how they were all condemned and rock and roll was the devil's music and it wouldn't last and all that	2664	B
i- i you know i keep thinking that you know i- i uh uh uh are are we doing the same thing with this rap stuff	2664	B
i mean at- at- at least with rock and roll it took talent	2664	B
yeah yeah you know all you got to do is is you know i it just amazes me	2664	B
yes a scratchy record you know	2664	B
yeah really	2664	B
it's it it it i- i just don't get it course i guess that dates us it means you are forty	2664	B
oh yeah now that that i do enjoy i do uh yeah you know and i've been hearing a lot lot more of it lately too	2664	B
well	2664	B
you know you know uh uh i know that somewhere you know i mean we we were really fortunate because you know we we had a you know the times of the Beatles and	2664	B
and and and things like that i mean you know that music is i really think the Beatles music will probably last you know	2664	B
yeah it- it- it they're immortal but uh	2664	B
i- i just really don't know if uh what is it RBQ or whatever that i- i don't even know run- run- run- run run something uh	2664	B
Run DMC yes Run D i mean uh uh yeah	2664	B
uh no exactly- exactly you know it is it going to be picked up by a symphony you know and and and	2664	B
no	2664	B
no well i don't know maybe you will but uh you know uh it it it just doesn't translate there is no melody	2664	B
you know it it it's	2664	B
you know just give me shelter	2664	B
well uh the hard rock from your time from our time	2664	B
yeah yeah okay well okay i- i- i agree with you i don't have any trouble with you know uh uh with with with Zeppelin stuff i don't have any trouble with uh uh	2664	B
you- you- you- you know stuff that that Santana or or or or Hendrix i don't have any trouble with that	2664	B
but i have trouble with with this new crap uh well uh like i say well we've- we've done nothing but but prove our age today	2664	B
well	2664	B
yeah really	2664	B
well then what you do is you go you know and you and and- and you find the original and and and and you play it for them_1	2664	B
and luckily it it it it of course i- i i was i been divorced but uh my my my my first wife has that first collection of of songs that that that you could probably prove them_1 with you know	2664	B
oh i'm sure you probably have a lot of those then	2664	B
oh yeah	2664	B
oh yeah oh wow i bet that really is a problem finding a stylus because_1 turntables are	2664	B
are going the way of the of the of of the	2664	B
yeah something	2664	B
yeah i uh yeah i suggest you latch onto it you know uh i was just trying to think that uh i can suggest something to you you might look at are you familiar with Crutchfield	2664	B
uh Crutchfield Electronics they also have a catalog and i've found	2664	B
i've got Beta machines and finding hi-fi beta tape has become almost impossible	2664	B
well i found that i can get it through them they have a lot of you know stuff that that that that um	2664	B
that you may be able to order through them_1 so if you have access to a computer or anything like that you might get one on them of one of them like Comp U Serve i think Comp U Serve has Crutchfield so you can get on with them and and uh	2664	B
and you know and get one of their catalogs	2664	B
yeah if you if you if you have access to a computer and one of the information services uh i would suggest that that's the way you go	2664	B
you've got the real wow far out	2664	B
oh really	2664	B
didn't know that he sang on any of it	2664	B
uh all right	2664	B
listen it's been a pleasure i'm getting ready for Star Trek the Next Generation	2664	B
it's coming on in two minutes so i've enjoyed talking with you but i got to have my priorities	2664	B
all right take care	2664	B
bye-bye	2664	B
uh that's interesting because i've talked about this subject before and it it didn't come up to either one of us to act uh	2687	B
no- no- nothing that i would consider major probably the most that anything of mine has ever been violated is uh	2687	B
you know like you know how people throw their change like into uh the glove box or the ash tray of their car and	2687	B
one time we had you know some kids go up and down the street and anybody whose car was open they kind of trashed that stuff out but they didn't do any vandalism and yeah it bugged me but you know when i think of crime and and things that could happen	2687	B
i i guess that was minor	2687	B
i have	2687	B
ah that's a very popular pass time up here do you have a Vette	2687	B
a TransAm uh in fact there was a ring i know that you stop right up here and uh the police department would call TI security when they knew they were in town basically and say	2687	B
you know tell all your folks with Vets and whatever else to be look- on the lookout for them but that's expensive you know	2687	B
yeah they don't want to write you	2687	B
uh	2687	B
oh that's not good	2687	B
well okay	2687	B
now i uh i mean i've had other members of my family touched um i have had a cousin of mine that was murdered	2687	B
uh things like that uh for no apparent reason you know it's that was lost in the country trying to find her folks new house up in Kansas and	2687	B
stopped to use the phone and a teenage kid whose parents had lots of money	2687	B
uh killed her so nothing was ever done to him	2687	B
but so you know yeah i i'm not sure there's many lives that aren't affected by it somewhere	2687	B
uh i don't know what the answers should be per se	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
uh-huh	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
i um i would like a home alarms that perimeter alarm system i've been very impressed with the one that the Amway Corporation uh	2687	B
puts together because it's it's as extensive as you want it to be you can	2687	B
you can kind of coordinate to your own home you know however many uh types of devices you need and it's a wireless system so it's not one they can disable	2687	B
the name Amguard	2687	B
yeah they make it uh-huh and	2687	B
oh	2687	B
oh	2687	B
yeah about my husband he's like one of these like i want to have guns and guns kind of scare me	2687	B
uh not so much for me you know i feel like i'm responsible i'd learn how to use it and yes i could shoot someone if you know they were trying to take my kids or take my life or	2687	B
you know i'm basically a nonviolent person but i could do that	2687	B
but it scares me because of so many accidents that have occurred with children in the home that find the guns and	2687	B
uh you know accidentally shoot a brother or shoot a sister or shoot themselves and i'm not real sold on that yet	2687	B
by their own	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
well are you for uh capital punishment	2687	B
well that's interesting that you say that because i am too my my sadness with it occurs that it doesn't seem to be consistent	2687	B
you know i i have a hard time putting one person's death for the same crime that you send the other person to jail for	2687	B
you know it does to me need to be consistent but	2687	B
uh i i	2687	B
for life	2687	B
that's true	2687	B
that's true	2687	B
of course my husband's of the mind that you ought to take them all out in the back alley and shoot them	2687	B
i don't know i guess i have a little bit more compassion i do think they ought to have their day in court	2687	B
only because there have been ones sent away that didn't do it but i know that's few and far between	2687	B
i uh i don't know the answer you know i have always thought that maybe the answer to the dope problem that you know generates so much of the crime is	2687	B
you know it was always you know shoot the dealers and somebody made the you know take away the supply but somebody made a comment to me a couple of months ago that's kind of had me thinking he said	2687	B
he said somebody else will come up with the supply he said what you have to do is you know shoot or make it hard on the users because if the demand is gone they won't have anybody to supply to	2687	B
well that makes a little bit of sense	2687	B
sure	2687	B
sure	2687	B
that's true	2687	B
but where was it uh oh several years ago and i want to say like Malaysia	2687	B
something with an M Madagascar or somewhere a small country	2687	B
uh you know it's it's a crime punishable by- by death to them to be carrying anything and i think some British citizens had gone in like uh a lady and her son and they had some marijuana on them and they hung them	2687	B
was that Malaysia	2687	B
okay i knew it was something like that and i thought jeez that seemed so severe for marijuana but then i thought or is that just because um	2687	B
i have become accustomed to other things in hearing other things you know if i knew two of my best friends got hung for carrying a little bit of marijuana it might make me think twice before i ever did it if i was of the mind to you know	2687	B
so i don't know what the answers are but i	2687	B
i do feel like	2687	B
i do feel like when they're blatant criminals and they've got records that it seems like the system protects them more than it helps the others	2687	B
no we're not	2687	B
death	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
i don't know i know that you know i remember growing up and uh	2687	B
you know we'd leave the house open if we were in the house yeah if we went somewhere i grew up in a large i grew up in San Diego	2687	B
you know if we went somewhere sure we'd lock the doors if it was just down the street we wouldn't or if we were in the house we wouldn't	2687	B
but now you know i come home i lock the door if we open the door i lock the screen door you know i want it locked when i'm in it every time i go somewhere and i i just almost hate that feeling	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
well that's one way to look at it isn't it where'd you grow up	2687	B
oh okay	2687	B
um excuse me	2687	B
yeah that's pretty minor when i think that some people give their lives so	2687	B
i don't know the answers though i i i do wish we had a system that was a bit more fair	2687	B
oh well that's good	2687	B
right i'm sure that's true i'm sure that's true	2687	B
i do know that our neighbor across the street our development is probably only eight years old	2687	B
maybe not that long we've lived here six years probably seven years old	2687	B
and uh	2687	B
the house across the street you know she walked in one night on somebody and of course he left she was fortunate	2687	B
but things like that make it real to me and aware that it really is going on	2687	B
you know that's it not a fairy tale world here	2687	B
yeah	2687	B
that's true	2687	B
well	2687	B
and i appreciate you calling it's Gary right	2687	B
thank you very much huh you too bye bye	2687	B
well have you ever been a victim of any particular- any type of crime	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
sounds like you've been very fortunate i haven't had too many terrible things happen to me but my tee tops did get stolen one time off my car	2687	A
out of	2687	A
right	2687	A
uh no it's a TransAm	2687	A
it's very expensive and insurance companies don't like it either	2687	A
yeah well i i did put an alarm on the car after that	2687	A
and uh i kept that for a while until the alarm malfunctioned and started going off in the middle of the night for no reason and	2687	A
it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so i disabled it	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
right	2687	A
yeah	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
yeah you stop and think about what you can do to uh to prevent or reduce crime	2687	A
and in fact tonight uh alone i i got a phone call from one of the security uh	2687	A
uh systems home security systems that uh install uh	2687	A
uh	2687	A
systems in your home to uh	2687	A
monitor and uh	2687	A
i guess detect uh it's that- that type of break ins	2687	A
they uh	2687	A
have a certain fee that they charge each month and an installation fee and they're real hot- hot about uh trying to get uh trying to sell these systems to everybody	2687	A
do you know what the	2687	A
do you know the name brand is for that	2687	A
okay that's the their own personal alarm brand okay	2687	A
there are several systems like that there's one that uh	2687	A
uh employees sale sold once upon a time called Schlage	2687	A
that's also modular and wireless and you can add as many sensors as you need to	2687	A
well there's some- some	2687	A
right but there's also a lot of people who are end up being victimized by their own weapons	2687	A
a burglar comes in and uh finds a gun and ends up using it against the owners of the house so	2687	A
oh certainly yeah depending on the crime i think i discussed that at at another time	2687	A
right	2687	A
well it's such a waste of taxpayers' money too to put them in prison for life	2687	A
uh especially if there's no chance of parole	2687	A
so	2687	A
uh	2687	A
sometimes that's the best solution i guess	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
yeah	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
well it makes some sense but uh	2687	A
the the users end up being addicts and they uh they commit crimes for for a living to make the the cash to buy their drugs with so	2687	A
uh and they have no respect or for for any other people anyway	2687	A
oh that was in Malaysia and they they were two two guys from Australia	2687	A
and	2687	A
right	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
well we're not the only country that has a a drug problem	2687	A
a lot of a lot of countries do especially smaller third world nations and their governments uh strictly enforce uh	2687	A
policies against uh drug use and uh uh dealing and things like that so yeah the death penalty uh exists and it is put in force	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
right	2687	A
well you make a habit out of it and it's a tolerable situation	2687	A
uh i also grew up in in a rural area and my a lot of my relatives are on dairy farms	2687	A
they would leave the house unattended unlocked just figuring that if anybody really wanted to break in	2687	A
they would anyway and there wasn't much of value to take any way so	2687	A
uh up in uh Wisconsin	2687	A
but i've been fortunate i guess in that the only things that have happened to me are the tee tops and hubcaps off cars well	2687	A
sure uh-huh	2687	A
and and Plano is pretty good about it too they've got excellent uh police force here	2687	A
uh i haven't seen any any evidence of uh any uh	2687	A
mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood	2687	A
the suburbs it's not near as bad in the suburbs as it is in the city Dallas is pretty bad	2687	A
uh-huh	2687	A
yeah	2687	A
right	2687	A
that's right yeah i know people that have been victimized too a lot more seriously	2687	A
it's uh it's not pleasant to think about that and uh you have to live with that forever so	2687	A
yeah i enjoyed talking to you about the subject uh	2687	A
yes	2687	A
okay have a good evening sure bye	2687	A
well i guess uh the topic uh being favorite TV shows i uh i guess i could start by saying i'm just looking forward to uh watching the astronomers on PBS	2666	A
and uh unfortunately they're having a like but they're having the uh a uh not telethon but a uh auction on on PBS here and	2666	A
um-hum and	2666	A
well the first uh episode started out pretty slow but after that it uh obviously has been preempted by the auction the last week or so so it uh i guess i'll never know	2666	A
but uh and you	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
yeah yeah	2666	A
yeah well it's it is enjoyable i'll give you that it's funny	2666	A
but uh	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
i would imagine about the only time i usually preempt for i think like Monday night we usually uh watch a lot of TV because that's when Murphy Brown and uh and Designing Women a lot of those shows are on we tend to watch- always catch those	2666	A
and	2666	A
In the Heat of the Night	2666	A
that's uh that- is- Carroll O'Connor yeah	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
well okay	2666	A
yeah well i guess i guess now that they've uh got rid of Dallas which we uh we tend to watch religiously here at uh at- at least we're getting ready for the big final episode	2666	A
yeah i	2666	A
it's it's funny how they're uh now that the show's over they're kind of trying to complete all of these uh stories	2666	A
in a very short period of time so it's like you turn on about eighty seven things happen in an episode now	2666	A
and uh	2666	A
um-hum i guess uh the only rumor i've heard that they had in the papers so far is that uh the last episode is supposed to be like uh it's a wonderful life for JR	2666	A
so it's uh what what would life had been like if he would- had not been born there something like that so uh it's	2666	A
it's going to be funny i bet	2666	A
something- something tells me Larry Hagman's going to milk this role that uh all it's worth	2666	A
but uh	2666	A
no no not at all not at all that's uh that's true	2666	A
but	2666	A
oh do you- i i very rarely unfortunately it it comes on a little early here and i sometimes- i'm usually at work but they moved it to Thursdays and i guess that's what uh	2666	A
but uh yeah the the few times that i've been able to see it it's uh at first i didn't think so	2666	A
and when i first saw it i i haven't been able to see it very often but when i first saw it i said well well this looks like it's it's going to you know go over like a lead balloon it uh doesn't look like it's going to be good at all	2666	A
but the few times i've seen it i guess it's something that grows on you	2666	A
yeah	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
the the big thing i always hear about is i guess at the beginning they always open it a little differently where they all run to the sofa	2666	A
yeah that's it and then sometimes you know the like one episode i guess the sofa wasn't even there and they all just stood there and looked at each other and and stuff like that so so i hear a lot about that	2666	A
and uh it's almost- it's almost up there with uh Saturday Night Live i guess is the big now with that is the the guy with uh	2666	A
you know like Steve uh Steve Meister and and it's like wherever i go anymore i've uh i get got a chance not only to to visit a few companies and all that around here and uh	2666	A
it's like you walk into a lobbies of those places it's like you know Ralph Ralph Meister Ralphster and uh it's uh	2666	A
yep so it's like that's something that's really really taken off but uh	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
right right because_1 uh isn't that special i guess is the last one with uh with the church lady but uh	2666	A
oh uh	2666	A
uh it's always- not it's always something but uh	2666	A
when she	2666	A
oh what was that	2666	A
yeah uh-huh	2666	A
um-hum get caught in the regular conversation anymore	2666	A
and uh	2666	A
well especially if you have a nine month that nine month old that probably how about uh have you watched the the what's that new show Baby Talk or or the one with where the take off of Who's Talking	2666	A
yeah i haven't seen any of it yet but was it was it any good	2666	A
yeah um-hum	2666	A
yeah um-hum	2666	A
i guess we're also looking forward to the uh boy it's it's terrible that i guess we watch so much television but uh i guess the one other thing we're watching for is LA Law has uh last couple couple episodes coming up here	2666	A
and uh	2666	A
that was that was so wild when they when they got rid of uh the one uh actress uh Dey-	2666	A
a an elevator shaft that was that was pretty it's like we we were all	2666	A
yeah it was like we were all sitting here going what just happened i'd say if you- if if you if you weren't watching it was like boom you missed it and it's like next thing you know they're all just looking down the shaft going you know what happened	2666	A
uh so it uh and now with uh all the lawyers you know rising in arms and going off to join uh Michael i guess whoever uh	2666	A
yeah yeah- matter of fact uh i guess that's going to be the same- same uh what Dallas and uh LA Law and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year	2666	A
and they keep uh	2666	A
that's what i heard i guess uh like- like Susan Dey and a few of them_1 are up for contract renewal and they didn't do it or something like that	2666	A
yeah	2666	A
yeah because_1 i	2666	A
it it's pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not going to be there long because_1 he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh	2666	A
i guess her and and the blonde uh district attorney or went went to teach that seminar to the Russian uh Russian lawyers at the uh	2666	A
at the swimming pool there in Palm Springs and uh you can see they're really starting to build up their characters and they've they've kind of really down played like uh Corbin Benson and uh few of those uh the top ones Harry Hamlin a lot of them_1	2666	A
okay_1	2666	A
um-hum	2666	A
oh really huh	2666	A
uh no i'm in the uh where i'm in Texas	2666	A
yeah um-hum	2666	A
oh with the Simpsons and all that	2666	A
yeah because_1 i- i because_1 i guess it's on at seven o'clock on on Thursdays yeah and sometimes i don't uh don't usually make it that on on that late in the week	2666	A
usually by then i'm working a little later and later it seems and uh and never get home to watch it but uh it was better when it was on Saturday i couldn't uh didn't have an excuse then	2666	A
but uh oh well	2666	A
i guess uh you show it shows we you too Michelle you have a good evening bye-bye	2666	A
oh yes that	2666	B
oh uh-huh	2666	B
i'd noticed that in the in the TV Guide and i'd totally forgotten all about that	2666	B
and it looks like it would be an a good series	2666	B
oh i i have a very wide range of uh uh different shows that i like uh	2666	B
uh it's i mean i mean even the what is it America's Funniest Videos there's just there's something about that i don't i don't know if it's the simplicity of it or just the total stupidity of it that is good	2666	B
yeah	2666	B
and uh uh i i don't- i don't get to watch TV that often or sit back and enjoy it i have a nine month old so that occupies a lot of the time	2666	B
yeah	2666	B
yeah those are good i like uh In the Heat of the Night	2666	B
yes	2666	B
uh right uh that that's had some good episodes to it	2666	B
and then plus and then of course you have to have at least one soap opera	2666	B
uh right i- i- i mean at least Knot's Landing or something on that order	2666	B
right right- i've been uh i tend to i try to catch that every now and then and i mean you still catch up with it you know every couple of weeks	2666	B
um-hum	2666	B
uh right yeah i been trying to catch it the last few weeks so i can see how it ends	2666	B
oh no	2666	B
should be interesting right lots of tongue in cheek	2666	B
uh right he's uh uh with him producing it it he hasn't done a bad job	2666	B
we uh sort of get a kick out of the Simpsons	2666	B
uh-huh	2666	B
right	2666	B
it it definitely grows on you and you think that it's	2666	B
so far fetched you know with the normal family life that uh but	2666	B
every now and then they'll surprise you and have a moral to it and they do the right thing	2666	B
yeah- right and uh the things that uh Bart will write on the uh chalk board at school	2666	B
right	2666	B
yes	2666	B
right we do that a lot at work	2666	B
right uh yeah there- there're a lot of things come off of Saturday Night Live that uh	2666	B
get caught up into the normal everyday routine	2666	B
yeah- right	2666	B
and uh	2666	B
oh what was the one that Gilda Radner did	2666	B
oh and and i'm- i'm and i'm real good at it too oh well- well no it's not in that special that uh well anyway but you know what i'm saying there's you know things will get picked up from it and uh	2666	B
right	2666	B
right- oh yeah well TV's on constantly here whenever we're at home	2666	B
uh i've seen one of i've seen one part of an episode	2666	B
it didn't do anything for me i	2666	B
uh we like Look Who's Talking you know and this just wasn't anything to me like it	2666	B
you know with uh wasn't it Bruce Willis that did the voice but uh you know there's just something with that	2666	B
yes	2666	B
right i've been catching that that's been real interesting	2666	B
yes the one that fell down the yes	2666	B
i was like wait i missed that rewind- rewind- rewind here	2666	B
uh right right	2666	B
um-hum it looks like it's gonna the last few episodes are going to be good	2666	B
right and well and LA Law is getting rid of several of their characters	2666	B
yeah- uh uh i heard that uh they wanted to keep it fresh and did not have the same ones there forever and so they would be bringing in new ones or whatever	2666	B
uh-huh	2666	B
yeah	2666	B
uh yes	2666	B
oh yeah uh	2666	B
at the swimming pool	2666	B
yeah see i think	2666	B
yeah and those- i know that those three were supposed to leave and i don't remember about uh	2666	B
oh what is it uh Sprinchez	2666	B
i don't know if i don't know if he's supposed to leave either or not	2666	B
but uh are you out on the west coast	2666	B
oh you're in Texas okay	2666	B
uh you mentioned the time and i was- i uh the time frame and i got confused there	2666	B
yeah um-hum	2666	B
right on Thursdays yeah	2666	B
yeah	2666	B
right we've- we've covered a lot of them	2666	B
well i enjoyed talking to you	2666	B
you too bye-bye	2666	B
well with- with an engineering degree it's of course it's a whole lot easier	2619	B
because uh	2619	B
yeah if if somebody had- is totally unfamiliar with it uh human nature being what it is we don't like to change	2619	B
uh it just makes- absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal	2619	B
and it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another	2619	B
right	2619	B
that's right	2619	B
right right	2619	B
uh-huh	2619	B
oh yeah	2619	B
that's right	2619	B
that's right it's all their fault	2619	B
of course being part of the European community if everybody else did it they they were probably much more is much more necessary for them than for us	2619	B
well-	2619	B
uh there's an expression for that with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future	2619	B
right right	2619	B
yep well i- i don't think it'll it could ever happen with with a quick transition	2619	B
no i- i think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such as it is	2619	B
i would think it would take probably two or three years before people could- could completely cut the cord	2619	B
did they switch	2619	B
well that's true it it has to be kind of a discreet transaction	2619	B
interesting	2619	B
oh yes	2619	B
yeah	2619	B
yeah	2619	B
i'm sure	2619	B
exactly exactly	2619	B
well we do have the two liter soda pop bottles	2619	B
yeah	2619	B
right yes	2619	B
that's true	2619	B
well sure have enjoyed our talk	2619	B
okay God bless bye-bye	2619	B
well um what what do you think about the metric system uh do you uh find it usable have you tried much with it	2619	A
yeah	2619	A
um-hum to use you mean uh-huh	2619	A
yes	2619	A
yes	2619	A
um-hum um-hum well i've i've lived	2619	A
both in the United States and and in a country where they do use the metric system and uh so i've i've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over um	2619	A
the secret seeming to me is to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilometers-	2619	A
uh kilograms and i think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is two point fifty four centimeters how on earth am i every going to do the math	2619	A
and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and	2619	A
you know and leaving it at that	2619	A
and uh you know a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch cause i still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but i'm perfectly comfortable using either	2619	A
and i think the real problem with this this weird conversion you see signs that say fifty five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know people you know it's hard to take it seriously	2619	A
and as long as both were given you basically just don't read the kilometers per hour you just say well look read the miles per hour one the other one must be for someone else	2619	A
uh i don't know i mean even Britain has converted over and we inherited this mess from them and uh	2619	A
well i mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light	2619	A
um i don't know why they were- um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now	2619	A
and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to	2619	A
that's true that's that's probably true and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting you know some other model	2619	A
i've never heard that one that's very nice	2619	A
oh so i'm all for the metric system and converting over and i think i guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers	2619	A
or just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and uh	2619	A
just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert remember me getting a package of something that said one pound	2619	A
is a package of dates mind you it's was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely it said one pound and then in parenthesis it said four hundred and fifty four point six grams	2619	A
and as near as i could tell seeing that was basically {antimetric} propaganda cause anyone who would say well look i can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty four point six grams which of course they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway um	2619	A
every time i see something like that i think well that's that's an {antimetric} argument	2619	A
you don't	2619	A
um-hum um-hum	2619	A
yeah oh oh that's what i was thinking by quick transition i didn't mean you know i didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything you know at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything	2619	A
uh i believe so yeah and i think they did it overnight cause you know you can't do it gradually that's an example of something you can't do gradually	2619	A
yes it does a quantum leap from left to right hand drive	2619	A
and they but you know that must have taken uh that was something that had to be done quickly you know because of external circumstances but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe or the rest of continental Europe and	2619	A
you know but that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate um	2619	A
so i- i- i- i- i think it's essential that it's done and i think the real trick is to avoid the	2619	A
you know a little more attention to human psychology and whereas people want round numbers and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch and so what the exact	2619	A
the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented really i think	2619	A
uh-huh i saw that i saw that the other day i don't- don't drink soda pop but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle so yeah things like that	2619	A
are a good start and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the	2619	A
pounds come in the the you know the odd numbers you know two point two pounds or something i think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible one	2619	A
yes well get back to what you're doing and i'll do the same i enjoyed talking with you too okay bye-bye	2619	A
okay what do you think about it	2628	A
oh yeah	2628	A
uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby	2628	A
but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean it- it really is coming to that because most women	2628	A
now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like	2628	A
yeah	2628	A
right	2628	A
now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small	2628	A
until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn't have to work i mean i didn't work i i needed to but i didn't	2628	A
let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you would- you know	2628	A
oh yeah	2628	A
right right well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two	2628	A
and i mean it's hard with two now we uh my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one	2628	A
i just don't know where it would come from	2628	A
because i work now i work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got	2628	A
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot	2628	A
right	2628	A
and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous	2628	A
i mean absolutely outrageous and they're getting worse	2628	A
uh my daughter brought home a book the other day	2628	A
that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh but it is it's getting worse and	2628	A
if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working	2628	A
right but i think i would have had to work if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work	2628	A
but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because	2628	A
if you have two or three kids by the way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing there isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home	2628	A
yeah	2628	A
well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time and um well i work all week and um i can't imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do	2628	A
and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter	2628	A
there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know and then when everything's set up then you look for	2628	A
somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family	2628	A
i mean that's just the way it was you know and uh that's like when my mom- i know when my mother's age it was	2628	A
always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an	2628	A
yeah	2628	A
uh-huh	2628	A
right	2628	A
yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and	2628	A
we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and uh i didn't have kids for four and a half years	2628	A
right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don't just get ready	2628	A
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and	2628	A
i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and uh kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really	2628	A
if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way	2628	A
because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then	2628	A
and uh even though i'd like to have grandchildren i can see her point	2628	A
right	2628	A
uh-huh	2628	A
um	2628	A
yeah	2628	A
yeah and it really is i know it just like now you know there's	2628	A
there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like	2628	A
boats or we go on trips or you know just	2628	A
the more or less like entertainment stuff but	2628	A
yeah i feel like i have you know because well we're to the age now i'm not old but i'm older	2628	A
and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldn't i don't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but	2628	A
but uh	2628	A
well you know more and more of them are i don't know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they're getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people	2628	A
you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying	2628	A
all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals	2628	A
i don't-	2628	A
oh really um	2628	A
well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so um	2628	B
i- i think a lot of it has to do with women working	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah- yeah	2628	B
right right	2628	B
and it and it seems if you're going to have kids uh that you are	2628	B
you know society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it	2628	B
and uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three you know um	2628	B
uh-huh	2628	B
oh that is good	2628	B
yeah Steve's Steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in uh March and she doesn't have to work either i don't know how they do it	2628	B
i don't- i don't know how people do it with one you know um obviously	2628	B
yeah obviously we don't have any and and i don't i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married	2628	B
and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to set- have have your family and i don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family	2628	B
you know and	2628	B
right	2628	B
oh	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and	2628	B
stuff	2628	B
oh i know i know	2628	B
jeez	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
but that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i'd of had four i guess it's always not not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah and and that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home you know i think i'm just part of that- the new stuff that is just	2628	B
i don't know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
right	2628	B
that's you did that's what you did	2628	B
uh	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
i uh i i like the way it is it's uh being see we're from Houston and so it's not so hard	2628	B
for people you know you've been married three or so years and you don't have kids well it's okay not- nobody does but you come to a place like Belton	2628	B
and there- a lot of the kids here get married out of high school it's real small town	2628	B
and it's and a lot of people in our Sunday- we're the only couple in our Sunday School class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can't have children who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and i'm going well you know	2628	B
there's more to life you know there's life in there that's you know not everybody has to have kids and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it's your turn you know	2628	B
uh-huh	2628	B
yeah i think that's what it is i'm not either	2628	B
they're probably going oh i bet she can't get pregnant	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
uh-huh right	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
yeah Steve's mom finally uh	2628	B
finally said- you know said that that God will take care of us when it's our time	2628	B
she finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family	2628	B
and she stayed home and raised her kids and and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call and	2628	B
i was raised totally opposite how we got together i don't know but because my mother had six girls	2628	B
and you know she worked too and i guess i just	2628	B
and i saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard you know	2628	B
uh-huh	2628	B
right	2628	B
yeah i think you've you've earned that though	2628	B
uh-huh	2628	B
yeah	2628	B
right	2628	B
yeah i think so i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both	2628	B
a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you	2628	B
uh-huh	2628	B
are they	2628	B
right	2628	B
yeah i don't know if the TI in Dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it we're it's too small around here yeah	2628	B
no i do it in spurts	2696	B
yes and i've i should do it on a regular basis but uh for some reason i think it's tough to get into a a particular routine	2696	B
oh	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
um-hum	2696	B
oh a very appropriate topic then	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
i think it's probably as good for her anyway	2696	B
uh they're they're natural i do a lot of uh hunting	2696	B
and have a bird dog and i enjoy watching that dog run more than i do anything	2696	B
they are they're just beautiful and the native instinct that they have is just amazing to watch	2696	B
it's a setter um-hum	2696	B
yeah that's a good combination pet and hunting dog both	2696	B
oh my you are ambitious	2696	B
right	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
are so you just run in your neighborhood	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
i do you belong to a health club	2696	B
no i've i've done some of that and the YMCA and other types of things too uh	2696	B
i just don't enjoy running i- i enjoy walking fast and with hand weights and things like that but	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
uh-huh	2696	B
oh good	2696	B
yeah running there's no question that running will will get your attention as far as uh weight control but	2696	B
hum	2696	B
do you run with anyone	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
um-hum	2696	B
but do you do you have that feeling of boredom sometimes in running or	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
um well you ought to get in the car and measure it one day	2696	B
oh	2696	B
your your daughter is wise we had a	2696	B
we had a friend uh who was jogging and	2696	B
passed out and collapsed and had a heart attack and fell over and they took him to the hospital and it took a while to to find out who he was and where	2696	B
um-hum	2696	B
yeah you know Nancy i think there are a lot of uh people now who are paying more attention to uh physical fitness and i think it's a good idea yeah i	2696	B
uh-huh	2696	B
oh uh the yes i know what you um-hum	2696	B
right	2696	B
have you tried niacin	2696	B
have you tried niacin	2696	B
um-hum	2696	B
oat bran	2696	B
have you tried oat bran	2696	B
okay	2696	B
my wife uh	2696	B
went on that on a very strict basis and it really brought everything down um-hum	2696	B
um-hum	2696	B
um-hum	2696	B
well i think keeping in in physical shape helps the mental shape too	2696	B
yeah do you play tennis or golf or anything	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
but	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
i enjoy that and that and i- i think i use that as a phase of of my exercise program yeah	2696	B
uh when it gets warm yes yes	2696	B
right	2696	B
oh	2696	B
early morning and late evening	2696	B
early morning is a good time	2696	B
yeah	2696	B
uh-huh	2696	B
oh very very comfortable then right	2696	B
oh yes yes	2696	B
well i see people with mace and and other things	2696	B
is that is that your dog calling you to go running again	2696	B
okay	2696	B
it certainly has and good luck keep it up	2696	B
bye	2696	B
okay	2696	A
do you exercise every night or not	2696	A
do you	2696	A
yeah i i'm on uh a right now i'm on one of those jags where i- i exercise at well i- i run every night	2696	A
and uh	2696	A
i just i was surprised i could run i didn't think i could i thought well i maybe a half a block i can run but i have really amazed myself but what i do i walk oh about a half a mile and i walk uphill	2696	A
and then i run all the way back down by the time i get down to my street i've worked up a pretty good momentum and i can just keep right on running until i get home	2696	A
and uh i'm not right now i just got through doing it so i'm a little bit out of breath i'm really not as winded as i would thought thought i was going to be	2696	A
but i have a little dog i run with so i'm and she's getting old i don't know if i probably not good for her but it's good for me	2696	A
yeah i think so	2696	A
oh do you	2696	A
yeah aren't they pretty i not	2696	A
uh-huh	2696	A
is it a pointer or	2696	A
setter yeah i think they're the prettiest	2696	A
i had a a Greyhound i was race i was running with but uh	2696	A
he was i found- i just i tried uh	2696	A
i finally had to give her back to the Greyhound Association she was just too big for me she she weighed seventy pounds and uh	2696	A
if she would run with me you know and stay with me but if she saw something she wanted if she wanted to get away she could have she would have drug me i mean when i walked with her people you know would laugh because she drug me when i tried to walk	2696	A
and when i tried to run i was afraid she'd really take out running and just have and they can run i think uh forty miles an hour and uh gosh uh she got away from me a couple of times and	2696	A
so i'd rather run with a little Pekingese any old day they're my my more my style	2696	A
yeah yeah i'm i'm too chicken to get out any place else	2696	A
no	2696	A
oh have you	2696	A
yeah	2696	A
oh okay well that might be my i have a walking tape i use i bought me a little head set you know and a little walking tape which really helps but but i wanted to run for some reason and you know and i- i didn't really think i could	2696	A
because_1 i- i remember years ago when i tried my side would hurt real bad and everything	2696	A
but i i'm on a health kick i've decided uh my cholesterol was high and my triglyceride's high so i've i've uh done that and i'm on uh	2696	A
i everybody says i don't need to lose weight but i feel i must so i'm going to try to lose ten pounds and i've lost four of it so i'm really	2696	A
yeah and i do it every night except for i- i do volunteer work at the hospital one night a week so i don't do it that night but the other uh six days a week i run	2696	A
no just my dog	2696	A
i had a neighbor across the street that was going with me but she can't run because she said her ankles hurt or her knees or something and so i uh what i do i'll walk with her up the top hill and let her take my dog and then i run home	2696	A
if she's home she's a flight attendant so she's not home very often and so when she's home i run with her but her walk with her but	2696	A
i would if i didn't have this radio on my head	2696	A
i- i think i in fact i haven't been using my walking tape since i've been running i've been using just my radio and if i didn't have that to go but i have to what i do is i have to set goals for myself i say okay i'm going to make it to the end of that block and then when i get there i'm going okay i've got to make i just go a block at a time	2696	A
if i didn't i- i- i don't think i could make it and i need feel that running you know three and four mile i don't think i could do it i could- you know i a mile is real and it may not even be a mile i'm running it feels it looks like a mile to me but it may not be	2696	A
yeah i think i think i will this weekend i but i'm almost afraid to i'm afraid that it's oh all this for nothing you know	2696	A
i could go a little bit further but i just don't you know golly i'm not a spring chicken any more and i don't want to have to	2696	A
my daughter got after me she said now you are taking identification with you and i said no i'm just in the neighborhood she says well mother what if a car should jump the the road and hit you or what if you stumbled and fell and knocked yourself out and they wouldn't know who you were	2696	A
i said well she is smart you know	2696	A
oh yeah	2696	A
um-hum	2696	A
yeah i realized she was right after that so now i uh i carry a little ID with me that shows who i where i live anyway and i put my daughter's telephone number for emergencies so	2696	A
oh i do too	2696	A
and i go religiously for a check up every year and uh my triglycerides were three hundred and sixty five now this what makes me mad i'm i- i don't eat beef i don't use salt i watch my diet all the time and i uh	2696	A
it was three sixty five it's supposed to be a hundred and fifty my cholesterol was two hundred and thirty five well i've gotten that down to a hundred and ninety and my triglycerides have come down to two seventy three but they told me that it takes about three months for triglycerides to come down so it's coming down and	2696	A
and i think this and exercise and really watching your diet does it i've been on that diet that	2696	A
what's that Tommy Lasorda thing uh diet	2696	A
ultra fast ultra slim ultra yeah slim fast that's it i've been doing that and it's not too bad uh i don't need	2696	A
huh	2696	A
no but i'll tell you what i'm doing i'm doing the uh omega fish fish oil calcium lecithin- lecithin	2696	A
uh vitamin B6	2696	A
no but i'll that's my next step i'm	2696	A
uh-huh	2696	A
did it well they they say that the nurse at works said the uh the fish oil would uh would bring it down and the lecithin is supposed to bring your cholesterol down	2696	A
so and my doctor really was more concerned with uh my triglycerides but he said well my God Nancy no wonder you you have high triglycerides- look how look how your weight's jumped and it jumped seven pounds in one year i think you'd think i was	2696	A
i'm a a a size eight i said that's not fat i know you know logically that is not fat but i do realize i need to to lose some weight but	2696	A
oh i do too absolutely and i feel so much better about myself when i you know get into good shape when i lived in Orlando i went to weight watchers and i- i went from a size twelve to a size six in three months	2696	A
no i'm not real sporty	2696	A
years ago i used to play tennis but i'm so bad i ended up you know just chasing the ball all the time i'd like to do tennis again but uh	2696	A
well that's good exercise do you exercise uh do you play tennis very often	2696	A
oh do you now see i'll quit running when it gets warm when it gets hot i know there's no way i'll get out in that heat and run or even walk	2696	A
i'll probably balloon up	2696	A
yeah it'll it'll have to be well you know	2696	A
i know but then you have to go to work all uh i shower at night but i- i may just have to change my schedule yeah early in the morning about five in the morning five thirty in the morning when it first gets	2696	A
isn't yeah that's what i'll have to do and i'm really scared to go out at night after dark	2696	A
i not in this day and time and you know when i grew up it was different but nowadays you- i wouldn't i i'm not foolish enough to do that	2696	A
yeah	2696	A
yes she doesn't like me on the telephone she's so jealous	2696	A
so well it's been nice talking to you and uh	2696	A
you too bye-bye	2696	A
right um right my i'm from originally from Palestine over in east Texas	2654	B
yeah and uh the crime in in you know in east Texas is uh i- i think it's just about as bad the burglaries and uh the drugs and stuff seem to have moved out into that area	2654	B
uh	2654	B
yeah but uh	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
right uh i guess uh it is really scary but the uh recognizing or i think recognizing that a lot of the crime in these smaller cities is really geared toward	2654	B
the the major cities anyway because i think that you know the people that are involved in the drug scene out in the rural areas are really out there to provide for the little you know the center cities	2654	B
but uh right but uh i guess the question is what do you do	2654	B
uh you know i think that uh from my own observation that that a lot of it probably stems around the school system i- i don't want to blame the school system on everything because it's	2654	B
it's not what they're doing it's not that they're doing so much wrong as that they can't not cannot do	2654	B
a lot of the things that need to be done uh right well even even- not just education but uh even discipline and and things like that	2654	B
that the schools are not allowed to do anymore that uh the students you know are just they have so much control over the schools themselves that that everything seems to turn around that	2654	B
um	2654	B
um-hum	2654	B
right yeah	2654	B
right	2654	B
i do uh i travel a little bit in my in my job with i've got some clients in California and i was in California when the police out there beat you know beat up on that	2654	B
traffic deal yeah it's a real yeah really was and of and of course everybody's reaction to that was you know anger and disgust and shock and all of that but then when you turn around and look at at what's going on	2654	B
from the criminal element that- that- probably that does not even compare you know to what goes on {crimewise}	2654	B
and uh	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
but uh you know i- i- i really don't i don't know what the answer is but i think that if we don't find an answer	2654	B
soon that it's we're really going to be in a lot worse trouble than we are now	2654	B
i think uh perhaps the Supreme Court has taken a couple of steps in the right direction recently uh i understand that they lightened up a little bit on some of the the restrictions on you know crime investigation and stuff so	2654	B
and you know yeah	2654	B
right And say if you don't don't appeal	2654	B
to start with then you don't have the right to appeal	2654	B
and uh you know i think the	2654	B
uh-huh	2654	B
uh and it's	2654	B
that's uh that's a fact you you can	2654	B
look forward to a just a few days in jail sometime for you know for what would seem to be a major crime uh	2654	B
with uh appeals and all that and getting time credit for spending time in jail and i think they even give credit sometimes for the the time they're out of jail between	2654	B
between uh the time they're indicted and the time they're tried and stuff like that that still counts toward their sentence	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
yeah That uh i guess uh	2654	B
the uh the number of of beds available in a jails uh you know we've got to have it to increase because the number of criminals are increasing but we've got we really need to work on the other side you know to to	2654	B
right but uh i don't know what	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
well i think uh uh you know back to uh back to uh the the school situation the parents are the ones that that that demand all the rights for these students for the children	2654	B
they they want to put so much restrictions on and and and you know then they don't take on the responsibility themselves	2654	B
and uh	2654	B
so it's it kind of perpetuates itself eh	2654	B
yeah well i've i've got two that are they're still at home but they they think they're adults they're both out of you know out of high school one of them_1 go to college	2654	B
and uh i we really were nervous about our son uh the second one	2654	B
uh going to school and you know Richardson schools are some of the best around	2654	B
and even at that it's you know it was a real touchy situation as to what you know as to	2654	B
who the associates were there are students in every school system	2654	B
that uh you don't want your kids associating with if you can help it	2654	B
and uh you don't you know you don't have any control over it yourself	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
right	2654	B
so	2654	B
um-hum yeah it's uh we said you know that we'd have been a lot better off our children would have been a lot- a lot better off being raised in a smaller smaller area	2654	B
smaller town smaller school	2654	B
or at least we thought perhaps at the time but you know	2654	B
not so sure anymore we did have some friends that moved uh out into well out in rural Collin County	2654	B
thinking that that would have been a you know a better place for their kids and before their kids got out of school the drug scene had moved in out there	2654	B
and you know so they you notice that it's not not a whole lot different there than it is	2654	B
in you know in town	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
yeah	2654	B
so	2654	B
but well it's	2654	B
yeah i'm glad that they're not expecting us to come up with all the answers on these phone conversations right yeah yeah they you'd think that what	2654	B
well everybody's concerned but you know we give uh Congress and we give the state legislators the you know all these powers and authorities and everything and they- they spend a lot of time on it and they can't come up with the answers so right	2654	B
so but uh it's	2654	B
yeah maybe we maybe it's uh it's time for	2654	B
there to be more people involved i guess in in trying to find the answer but	2654	B
and since you know	2654	B
yeah well they can all they can do is enforce- enforce the laws they can't uh pass the laws and they can't run the the court systems and	2654	B
you know they do their do their job i don't i don't have a lot of complaints about the police myself	2654	B
but they're doing	2654	B
yeah yeah we	2654	B
um-hum well	2654	B
that's uh my wife said the other day said she just couldn't do that couldn't be a police officer because you're you know you never know	2654	B
what uh you know you stop by somebody for traffic accident and you walk up and they	2654	B
they've got a gun pulled on you or you know something of that kind and	2654	B
right yeah because	2654	B
yeah you you've got a they get a a domestic uh violence or domestic- domestic dispute and they get there and both of the parties turn on them	2654	B
um-hum	2654	B
yeah so	2654	B
well	2654	B
you think there's anything else to talk about on this subject okay well it's been nice talking to you okay thanks bye	2654	B
unfortunately it's apparently the crime wave is not limited to cities you know it's spreading to you know our communities also and smaller	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
i'm originally from a little little rural town in southern Oklahoma	2654	A
yes	2654	A
yes	2654	A
that is	2654	A
that's really scary it has it's done the same thing even in my little town and gosh it's only like a thousand people	2654	A
there's one deputy sheriff that tries to you know patrol the whole thing and he's you know he's just overwhelmed	2654	A
that's right	2654	A
sure it's probably a safer environment for them_1	2654	A
are you talking about {educationwise} yeah	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
that's right absolutely	2654	A
um-hum yeah	2654	A
yeah	2654	A
you know as you know you watch the nightly news you know like i do and boy you know that's not a day or night that goes by in this in this area at least as somebody at least somebody doesn't get killed or raped or robbed during this	2654	A
the jillion others we don't even hear about probably	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yes that's been a hot topic yeah	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yeah that's right	2654	A
that's right you never hear about	2654	A
and you know some- some of the crimes are so crazy you know	2654	A
just you know killing somebody for a five dollar bill or some stupid thing like you know you just you just never know you know it's i sometimes get concerned about you know driving down the down the street you know if you look crosswise at somebody they're liable to blow your head off	2654	A
it's really scary	2654	A
i don't know either	2654	A
yeah it's obviously not getting any better	2654	A
um-hum yes	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
right um-hum and even down to the death penalty i think as far as you know appeal after appeal after appeal i think they've finally began to say you know enough's enough	2654	A
yeah yeah	2654	A
that's right	2654	A
yeah a lot of people favor you know mandatory jail time with no no time- you know no good time off you know i don't know i don't know if that's an answer or not i'm not too sure people are really scared of jail time anymore because_1 they're in and out so quickly	2654	A
i'm not sure that's a real scary item for them_1	2654	A
you know it's	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yeah	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yes	2654	A
yeah	2654	A
right	2654	A
you know this building jails you know more jails the answer i'm not sure it is i don't know i honestly don't know i wish i did i'd be glad to share it with everybody if i knew	2654	A
yes	2654	A
yeah	2654	A
before they get to jail	2654	A
yeah i agree	2654	A
i don't know maybe you know maybe maybe it needs to start at home you know with the parents as much as they can do you know parents can only do so much up to a point and they've lost it	2654	A
um-hum right	2654	A
that's right	2654	A
i'll tell you the truth about_1 both i have two children both of are are you know young adults grown and gone away from home i'm honestly glad i'm not raising children at this point and time	2654	A
yes	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
absolutely	2654	A
yeah yeah it's no guarantee	2654	A
that's right	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
that's right if you can help it that's key you know	2654	A
that's right yep up to a point you after that you've lost it	2654	A
sure have i'm just glad i'm not raising young children anymore	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yeah um-hum	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
i'm not so sure	2654	A
yeah	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yeah that's right	2654	A
no maybe just a smaller just a smaller scale maybe but then- then- you know the idea is still the same it's there	2654	A
it really is	2654	A
i don't know uh like i say i'm just glad i'm not trying to have to raise small children again	2654	A
yeah me too in the time allotted no i don't don't think so but i don't i don't know anyone that isn't concerned about it	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
that's right not to mention monies spent	2654	A
so i don't know wish i did	2654	A
yeah i guess so	2654	A
police i'm sure are just you know {maxed} out	2654	A
there's only so much they can do	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yeah	2654	A
no i don't either as a matter of fact i think they're doing you know probably for the most part the best job they can do with resources they have it's really must be discouraging though to know that you know you bust somebody for something they may be out on the street before you finish your report you know	2654	A
that's got to be discouraging especially_1 if you've risked your life to to do course you know if you're a cop you expected to risk your life	2654	A
that's right	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
yeah	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
as i understand it talking to a couple of my police friends what they fear most is a call to go try to settle a domestic quarrel you know apparently it's very dangerous you just never know	2654	A
um-hum	2654	A
um that's right	2654	A
apparently it's very very dangerous situation	2654	A
no i don't i don't think i could be a cop i really don't	2654	A
i guess that's pretty well it	2654	A
nice to talk to you uh-huh bye-bye	2654	A
that's true	2674	B
do they have a law on the books up there	2674	B
right	2674	B
so what's your uh opinion on capital punishment	2674	B
yes uh	2674	B
there's	2674	B
you know there are some things just that just are inexcusable	2674	B
brutal crimes	2674	B
serial- serial- serial crimes things like that	2674	B
um you know to me the punishment	2674	B
doesn't even fit the crime but you can't get any worse	2674	B
right i think in a way it's unfortunate they've come up with with nice ways to	2674	B
um execute people i guess to me if if i was a uh	2674	B
potential serial killer or something it wouldn't stop me to be uh to die of lethal injection i mean it's as painless as you can go	2674	B
i mean i think if i was in a bad accident and they gave me the option i might say yeah you know give me an injection but uh	2674	B
i don't know about that um but uh you know the electric chair on the other hand is probably a pretty painful way to go i don't know	2674	B
i don't know personally i'll never be in that position	2674	B
so but i don't i think it should be something that is	2674	B
that is a deterrent that's something that that	2674	B
that's	2674	B
scary and it's something that's going to make you make you be afraid to uh afraid of the consequences	2674	B
depends on the nature of the abuse and i really don't uh	2674	B
you know that that's it's something that's got to be evaluated on an individual case you know because	2674	B
there's there's really no excuse for abuse but then	2674	B
there are other options there are ways to get out	2674	B
yeah i mean there	2674	B
you would hope but i guess it's really a	2674	B
it's easy to say but uh you'd hope that someone in that situation would	2674	B
you know get out there are enough support groups enough	2674	B
you know over the century- over the last decade or so anyway there's been	2674	B
you know you don't have to kill your uh kill your husband because he's	2674	B
beating you up all the time you can can leave and have support it's not like you'd be stuck on the streets	2674	B
this is almost as much of a crime and i guess	2674	B
and i guess	2674	B
i don't know it's to me it's almost as much of a crime to just let it go	2674	B
and i think i guess it gets back to if if if a woman kills her husband because he's been brutalizing her or her children there's maybe more of a reason and it's not an irrational	2674	B
you know just a brutal crime for the sake of	2674	B
just i don't know without a conscience or something like like some of these	2674	B
that's kind of what i think what capital punishment should be for is you know somebody that's just	2674	B
you know missing something upstairs or just goes out and	2674	B
you know rapes and brutalizes a woman and	2674	B
turns around and does it again	2674	B
and it's like there's just no excuse you	2674	B
there's no reason i should pay for this person to spend the rest of his life in in prison	2674	B
no but i don't think uh i don't think it's right for somebody to uh for me to to uh pay for something i mean the way- the way it is right now the prisons are overcrowded	2674	B
and we're giving people that aren't going to change	2674	B
we're just we're just housing them until they die	2674	B
and if they've you know caused as much pain and suffering as they have for for no reason and they're going to do it again if they get the chance	2674	B
it just- just doesn't seem uh	2674	B
right	2674	B
uh it's just like uh back in California the Charles Manson thing	2674	B
and of course he'll never i don't think he'll ever get out on parole just because it was so well publicized	2674	B
but uh you know he comes up every so often	2674	B
right	2674	B
maybe they ought to have an island out in the middle of the ocean we can drop them all off	2674	B
yeah Australia might not care for that these days	2674	B
on an island so far away there's no chance they can ever get off	2674	B
yes	2674	B
{alrighty} bye	2674	B
i know uh that Texas laws are more	2674	A
uh what's the word i want more real- i think realistic because they do believe in capital punishment and they do every once in awhile exercise that	2674	A
uh we're as i said Indiana's very conservative and i cannot remember the last time anyone was electrocuted or	2674	A
whatever method they use nowadays to carry out a death sentence	2674	A
they have uh uh	2674	A
you know i'm just not even aware of what the law is it's uh been so long since anyone was executed that it might be legal but it's not done	2674	A
my husband would know whether it's legal or not but	2674	A
i am not very	2674	A
i believe in capital punishment for certain crimes do you	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
right	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
they uh i think- to me i think they have to come to that with	2674	A
uh as you say brutal crimes because of the prison system being so crowded that seems like just because you don't have a place to put someone doesn't seem like a very logical reason to kill someone else	2674	A
which of course is what it is but	2674	A
i think it would be a detriment to crime- or would be a deterrent to crime because	2674	A
i know someone who's mad isn't going to think well gosh i can't do this or they'll put me away but	2674	A
somehow i think if the punishment doesn't fit the crime the crime's more likely to happen	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
go with it huh	2674	A
you think they should go back to crucifixion then	2674	A
um	2674	A
well we certainly hope not	2674	A
do you think uh you know uh lately they've had oh in the last few years they've had some cases where women have killed abusive husbands do you think that they should be faced with the death penalty	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
it does happen though doesn't it	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
yeah even in our small town of five thousand we now have a crisis center and it's been in existence for five years so even in this area where you would think there might not be the help	2674	A
uh there is help for women who are abused or children who are abused or whatever uh i can't imagine uh	2674	A
a mother standing by and watching something destructive happen to her children	2674	A
but i have a friend who's is a school teacher and she has a nine year old girl in her room who is suffering abuse and the mother is aware of it and is not	2674	A
protecting the child which just makes your skin crawl to even think about it but	2674	A
yes yes she's as guilty as he is	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
so you think our our uh values have to come down to dollars and cents	2674	A
yes	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
i guess the most frightening thing to me uh you're probably young enough that you've not aware of the Richard Speck case uh it happened in	2674	A
uh the Chicago area but it was certainly broadcast nationwide he broke into this uh complex uh apartment complex and killed these seven nurses	2674	A
and every once in awhile	2674	A
you know one of them did survive she crawled under a bed and he missed her somehow	2674	A
and she did survive and she did identify him and there is no doubt that this is the man who did that and every once in awhile he comes up for parole	2674	A
and it's scary to think that some board is sitting there trying to decide whether he is	2674	A
rehabilitated to the point that he can go back out in society when these young twenty twenty two twenty three year old nurses are all dead it just doesn't seem	2674	A
he should i think have made that his life should have been sacrificed for what he took	2674	A
as you say the punishment has to fit the crime doesn't it	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
uh-huh	2674	A
or Sirhan Sirhan and	2674	A
yeah of course also believe in deportation but that's another subject isn't it	2674	A
take them back to Australia the way the English used to do	2674	A
i see they've gotten a little narrow-minded about things like that	2674	A
yeah nice talking to you	2674	A
bye-bye	2674	A
yeah matter of fact it's sort of interesting because_1 they do have uh drug testings at the company i work at	2681	B
yeah um-hum	2681	B
uh	2681	B
i don't know i was uh	2681	B
for the most part the people that it's effected have not exactly been the most valuable employees so i personally think that you know it doesn't hurt the business center the work atmosphere	2681	B
you know	2681	B
yeah it's basically new employees	2681	B
yeah um existing employees are too but they for some reason they don't uh uh do anything about it you know they don't uh exercise it	2681	B
they supposedly have it but i've never heard of anybody getting randomly tested	2681	B
um electrical engineer yeah hold on just a second	2681	B
my ninth month old just got hold of one of my three and a half inch diskettes	2681	B
i think uh that won't last very long write protection just doesn't uh doesn't have any eat protection on it	2681	B
um	2681	B
right	2681	B
yeah	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
yeah they they i think the way they figured out with us is basically just they can globally say if anybody comes for you know an application white black educated uneducated everyone has to take it	2681	B
and that way you know they're open um and i guess you know our company has a fairly good turnover so i guess they figure that they'll get the majority of employees that way	2681	B
now i do know of um two employees that were fired because they they couldn't pass	2681	B
and i don't know exactly why they were picked out to do the drug testing because_1 i know i wasn't	2681	B
but um	2681	B
that's right interesting	2681	B
yeah	2681	B
yeah	2681	B
oh yeah yeah ours is for security reasons we're government contractors and they don't want secrets like leaking out	2681	B
yeah	2681	B
right yeah there are requirements matter of fact i think levied upon the company to have some sort of drug testing	2681	B
but uh	2681	B
oh yeah there was a a big thing saying that it was you know invading people's rights and things like that	2681	B
you know and but then again it's against the law so it's like how can they you know	2681	B
how can they be invading your rights uh verifying that you've just been invading the law you know	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
well they you know they said that um i don't know if it's ever been proven for sure but they were saying that some prescription drugs could show up as being drugs but	2681	B
yeah	2681	B
as long as they give you another shot	2681	B
yeah	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
right	2681	B
um in Virginia	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
where are you calling from	2681	B
oh okay	2681	B
oh	2681	B
oh	2681	B
okay well up i'm um up near the capitol	2681	B
up near D C	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
oh yeah	2681	B
yeah	2681	B
yeah yeah i- i missed it this year	2681	B
but uh you know we've we've seen it a couple of times and it's really nice but didn't get to see it this year there are so many things you take for granted when you're in here you know year round DC	2681	B
you know	2681	B
yeah every now and then we've been down there haven't uh taken the kids down yet though we uh took them to the White House for Easter Egg roll	2681	B
and uh down in the mall for fireworks and things	2681	B
and my oldest is uh two so she's just getting to the age where you know she'd recognize the whale and everything like that but	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
um-hum	2681	B
yeah i did too thank you bye-bye	2681	B
they do all right	2681	A
how do you feel about it	2681	A
um-hum are all employees subject- subject- uh subject to it or just a certain	2681	A
new employees	2681	A
yeah what about random testing	2681	A
what what type of industry is it Wayne	2681	A
electrical okay sure	2681	A
oh	2681	A
so	2681	A
uh i've i've never been involved in a company that had the drug testing but have been involved in companies that have discussed it one of them very very hazardous type of uh operation	2681	A
drilling oil and gas wells	2681	A
and there's enough problem with injuries in that area anyway	2681	A
uh without contributing to it through drugs or alcohol	2681	A
and you know it it was encouraged it's just a matter of a lot of businesses today i don't believe know how to implement a drug program	2681	A
uh how to really really have a good one whether it's preemployment or ongoing either one	2681	A
um-hum	2681	A
eventually have everyone yeah it at least run a spot check	2681	A
and i think maybe the knowledge that they could have random testing uh may have an effect too	2681	A
um-hum	2681	A
yeah	2681	A
i personally don't it's easy to see in some industries you know you don't want uh bus drivers or or pilots to be under the influence of drugs and it's easy to see that type but	2681	A
it can effect uh almost every every office	2681	A
um-hum	2681	A
right and	2681	A
are if you're government contractor you probably fall under some	2681	A
type of government supervision on it uh	2681	A
um-hum	2681	A
yeah	2681	A
did uh was there much objection to it prior to implementation or	2681	A
um-hum	2681	A
which is which-	2681	A
and people are confused uh i think too by what is a test you we all know about the uh Olympics and the testing there and how some of them can be wrong and	2681	A
uh	2681	A
i- i think they're afraid of	2681	A
appropriate prescription medication showing up some of them are some of the innocent ones are and they	2681	A
i think they can and uh i think a lot of it uh that's that's why the type of type of test is important	2681	A
and we we tend not to know uh we tend to think theoretically	2681	A
but lots of times getting down to the actual method and and results	2681	A
uh being evaluated properly is where we have a short fall	2681	A
where are you located Wayne	2681	A
in Virginia okay uh	2681	A
North Carolina	2681	A
but i've been in in uh Oklahoma for about twenty years so	2681	A
just got kind of got back to this part of this country originally from Virginia	2681	A
oh okay yeah pretty pretty time of the year up there now isn't it	2681	A
uh the uh	2681	A
Cherry Blossom Festival apparently went all right	2681	A
did you	2681	A
oh yes do you get to the Smithsonian	2681	A
but	2681	A
oh good good but i think	2681	A
that's one of the areas uh i've found several areas in the government	2681	A
that i really enjoy seeing money spent and the Smithsonian complex is one of them i think it's great to go through there and see	2681	A
kids of all all sizes and ages going through those buildings there	2681	A
um-hum and it'll be a great memory for her later too i think	2681	A
well the uh	2681	A
time limit i think is is about up but i enjoyed talking to you Wayne	2681	A
all right thank you bye	2681	A
let's see did i press one	2606	A
did i okay i didn't know whether you could hear because i- i have to take the phone away from my ear to do it	2606	A
did you hear it	2606	A
all right we're on uh hey Rick who's your favorite team	2606	A
oh okay and uh uh we're not to have much mutual interest there but i'm curious uh uh what class are they class A	2606	A
oh okay	2606	A
yeah do you go	2606	A
do you go see them very often	2606	A
well i imagine they're just starting	2606	A
do you you know what's exciting about watching- i never watched minor league teams until i came to Texas because i was raised one near Boston following the Red Sox and then i went to graduate school in Pittsburgh so i became a Pirate fan	2606	A
and i was never in a minor league city until i came Dallas- we were a minor league city when i came here in fifty nine and i immediately bought season tickets uh to the class triple A uh uh Dallas Rangers	2606	A
and then the class uh double A Dallas Fort Worth Spurs we later uh they went to the Texas league	2606	A
and uh i just really enjoy it i guess i enjoy watching guys when they were very first starting out playing here and then seeing them a year or two later as as stars in the majors	2606	A
uh and i- i think that's probably the fun of watching minor league baseball and the other thing is watching guys on the other end uh guys that i had seen play for both the Red Sox and Pittsburgh	2606	A
uh they get to the other end of their career and now they come up and talk to you between innings of games i- i think that was exciting too uh have you seen any minor leaguers come through uh any guys come through Raleigh that are now in the big time	2606	A
not yet okay well of course you're at the class A level you're a few years away from that	2606	A
uh hang on a second Rick i got to see who that is	2606	A
you still there Rick	2606	A
yeah uh uh do you follow any major league teams at all	2606	A
uh which ones	2606	A
oh okay okay well how do you think they're going to do this year	2606	A
fair huh	2606	A
yeah yeah	2606	A
well i think the Phillies picked up some good players in the free agent market didn't they	2606	A
and and the Dodgers i guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was letting uh Valenzuela go	2606	A
yeah i think they probably did he probably- i was reading the other day that what may have happened to him is he pitched too many innings too young	2606	A
they say that if a guy's pitching that that his arm is still developing until he's twenty five and if he pitches a whole lot of innings before that it may take its toll later in life	2606	A
of course i've been watching Nolan Ryan this afternoon and uh it doesn't seem to bother him	2606	A
uh he he has to be an outstanding physical specimen to to do what he's done	2606	A
uh well Palmer tried a comeback	2606	A
and uh got sore arm early and they uh the Rangers are playing Baltimore this game that i'm watching and just the last inning they put the camera over on he and Brooks Robinson they are the broadcast team for the Orioles now	2606	A
and apparently- apparently his uh his come back just didn't make it and that he got he got hurt early in the uh in the uh uh in the spring training uh	2606	A
oh the the Dodgers the Dodgers have got an interesting thing they've got this uh rookie pitcher what's it Martinez his name	2606	A
that uh that pitched a bunch of innings last year as a nineteen or twenty year old- year old and they were using what happened to Valenzuela as an example that they should be careful and not over work him this early of course i was really uh	2606	A
uh a Dodger fan a couple of years ago when they won the World- World Series and Hershiser won all those games in the World Series that was that was really a	2606	A
uh yeah the year they beat the As i was really and boy i can still remember that Kirk Gibson home run	2606	A
yeah they were because everybody thought the As were the greatest things in the world and uh we've got we're the only ones around here that got cable and that particular game was some reason or another was on a cable channel and uh my son's in high school and all his friends were here	2606	A
we're all sitting around we must have had ten people in our living room watching it gosh gosh everybody just erupted when that happened and uh that was uh uh strictly an outstanding game uh the uh	2606	A
uh the Dodgers the Phillies i'm not uh you know the National League we have an American League team here so i don't get that much into the National League stuff here i see them on the game of the week occasionally and i haven't seen the the Phillies	2606	A
that much i know that Mike Smith retiring a couple of years ago left a big hole offensively who do the Phillies look to to drive in a lot of runs	2606	A
well who do they	2606	A
of course you know Mike Marshall was the big guy the year that uh	2606	A
uh they won the World Series and Kirk Gibson Who who are are the Dodgers big RBI guys now	2606	A
yeah well i'm a i'm a Texas Ranger fan	2606	A
and uh you you know they are O and four but i think they're going to be one and four at the end of today they're sitting here with two out in the ninth with a uh fifteen to three lead	2606	A
that looks that that was fairly comfortable yeah and it was why and Nolan Ryan pitched the first seven innings today and he gave up three runs in the first inning and i said oh my God here we go again you know you know with two outs walk walk home run bang we're down three to nothing	2606	A
but they got four in their half of the first and then Nolan was invincible	2606	A
he went out after the seventh and had he had only give up those uh that one hit in the first inning and another hit so he went out after the seventh inning with a uh at the time he had a uh i think uh a nine to three ten to three lead and uh	2606	A
uh he had only given up two hits and uh two walks and nine strike outs so he's he's back in the groove and a a guy his age this this afternoon here it's about seventy nine degrees	2606	A
a little bit humid clear blue sky and the sunshine	2606	A
and the Rangers don't play many afternoon games because of the heat we have here in the summer	2606	A
but uh they try to play Sunday afternoons in April May and in September	2606	A
and uh uh with the bright sky like this where you've got a real bright day when he's out there throwing ninety four ninety five miles an hour he's almost invincible	2606	A
and uh that's just a exciting uh is really exciting sitting here watching him on TV this afternoon	2606	A
and	2606	A
uh well it different times different years because-	2606	A
because	2606	A
because my uh	2606	A
uh my job takes me out of the country a lot and it always seems to be during the summer uh last year we got to go out maybe about a dozen times which is the most we've ever gone out and we had about uh the Rangers	2606	A
won uh eighty three games last year which was just four more than they lost but we had an exciting time and that at one time in about the June July and August period we went to about eight straight wins	2606	A
and we happen to go out there on win night and uh uh they and they got hot then and i'm not sure they put the prices up a dollar a ticket this year we may have to go less but	2606	A
what we like to do the uh the stands have got three tiers to them and we like to be in the third tier behind home plate about the second row	2606	A
and uh the the park holds about forty thousand people and uh i never go on a night when they think there's going to be forty thousand there's just too big crowds i i pick the games where they don't	2606	A
expect to have a high attendance and uh what what about your your ball park in in Raleigh uh the minor league ball in Durham	2606	A
yeah	2606	A
four thousand	2606	A
oh that is great when i got here in the class triple A Rangers we used to	2606	A
pay two and if you bought a season ticket it was only one dollar a game	2606	A
and uh uh that is fine and not only that but you probably get some pretty good seats too	2606	A
yeah yeah what do they do they have times of the year where they have promotions and you get gigantic crowds like maybe four thousand where they actually sell the place out	2606	A
yes	2606	A
yeah	2606	A
oh yeah	2606	A
yeah i love that movie i absolutely love that and i guess the players uh you know the class A salaries are are really uh not anything a guy can live on too much so i guess they've got to go out and find rooming houses and	2606	A
things like the guy in Bull Durham did With fairly economical accommodations	2606	A
yeah and uh uh the other thing is that that's really hard but of course you recognize the minor league team exists for the purpose of the major league team and the problem we always had in triple A is you want to see the guys go good but then when they go good you know you're going to lose them_1	2606	A
you know during the season	2606	A
and i guess at at your level uh you lose them to the next level if if they decide to recall the the parent team the Braves decide to call to recall a guy from triple A then a double A guy goes up to replace him and a single A guy goes up to replace him	2606	A
and and and you've immediately uh now you got a your you go out to the ball park and your favorite player is not there anymore and you say you've got you've got to learn his his replacement but do you get any local uh do do they broadcast the games locally or televise them_1 locally	2606	A
no so you've you've got to uh	2606	A
yeah okay so	2606	A
so you you got you've got a pretty much go to the ball park uh uh to figure out but	2606	A
yeah but yeah yeah uh uh there's probably that's pretty neat because i don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other	2606	A
yes	2606	B
i guess that was one	2606	B
i heard the beep	2606	B
uh i guess the Durham Bulls	2606	B
yeah they're i think a farm league of the Braves	2606	B
but uh they're they're the closest by team to Raleigh North Carolina	2606	B
yeah actually uh we went a couple of times last year i haven't gone they started i guess about a week ago	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
um-hum	2606	B
um-hum	2606	B
okay	2606	B
um-hum	2606	B
okay	2606	B
um	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
um	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
uh not not yet i mean i	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
okay	2606	B
yes	2606	B
sure	2606	B
uh i like the Phillies and the Dodgers	2606	B
um fair	2606	B
i don't know the Phillies are so uh unpredictable	2606	B
but i think the Dodgers will do well	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah i don't know he's getting old i think they got their money- their money's worth out of him though	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
um	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
um	2606	B
yeah well have you heard anything about Jim Palmer	2606	B
right right	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
um	2606	B
right	2606	B
the the year they beat the As	2606	B
yeah that was really dramatic they were	2606	B
they were such under dogs	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
um	2606	B
um	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yes	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
i don't even know anymore i i- i follow the Dodgers more than the Phillies but uh i- i grew up in Philadelphia i guess that's why	2606	B
um-hum	2606	B
i think i um	2606	B
i don't know i thought i don't know	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
uh i think that's pretty-	2606	B
pretty good guess	2606	B
huh-uh	2606	B
hum	2606	B
hum	2606	B
oh	2606	B
hum	2606	B
um-hum	2606	B
right	2606	B
right	2606	B
um	2606	B
um	2606	B
wow often- how often do you go out to the baseball park	2606	B
um	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
um	2606	B
wow	2606	B
um	2606	B
um	2606	B
right	2606	B
um	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
it's uh it it's actually in Durham they're they're thinking about moving it to Raleigh	2606	B
but it's it holds maybe four thousand and it's like three dollars to get in	2606	B
so	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
oh yeah we're in the pretty much wherever you want to sit	2606	B
yeah they they give out stuff and it's have you ever seen the movie Bull Durham or is it it's just like that exactly	2606	B
well a little more modern day but not much	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
yeah	2606	B
no	2606	B
there's actually there may be an AM station that does it i'm not there may be an AM station that does it but i'm not i'm not really sure	2606	B
yeah but it's i mean you could you the game could be at seven thirty at seven fifteen and you could say hey let's go to the game and you'll get a seat	2606	B
no i mean it's it's actually there's an interstate	2606	B
okay do i still can't- still can feel that the Soviet Union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world absolutely	2602	B
and my reasons are based upon not only from what i read in the newspapers what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the	2602	B
fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group	2602	B
well that's what makes it a powder keg	2602	B
the um	2602	B
i'll go back in time a little bit to about eighty one	2602	B
when my first real involvement with the military started	2602	B
um	2602	B
naturally we were at the time the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got lots quite a bit of	2602	B
information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons	2602	B
i went to Lebanon in eighty three before the marines ever got there with the UN Peace Keeping Force	2602	B
and with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against	2602	B
these weren't these weren't Chinese made copies these were Soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box AK-47s	2602	B
as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into	2602	B
in Granada in October twenty fifth eighty three we invaded the place	2602	B
sure there were Cuban soldiers there but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots	2602	B
the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of of the island down on Point Salinas	2602	B
and for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors	2602	B
and they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons	2602	B
in eighty four	2602	B
i was down in Central America as an advisor to the Honduran army	2602	B
again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit plus Soviet advisors	2602	B
and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate Soviet made material	2602	B
do i consider them a threat absolutely	2602	B
they have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University	2602	B
about like A and M or UT where they're teachings subjects like that they're teaching terrorism	2602	B
some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against	2602	B
i'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more	2602	B
incidents than they did	2602	B
these guys are top of the line	2602	B
when they when they graduate from there	2602	B
they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world	2602	B
and they are very very good at what they do	2602	B
so until i see the entire	2602	B
quote old guard	2602	B
of the Soviet military of the Soviet government	2602	B
completely roll over and disappear preferably buried	2602	B
i still consider them a threat	2602	B
their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals- generals that actually control tens and thousands	2602	B
of troops	2602	B
that irregardless of what Soviet policy is they're going to do what the general tells them	2602	B
well it's interesting- interesting watching the different Soviet states Albania Lithuania	2602	B
doing their little revolts down there	2602	B
each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there	2602	B
so far they hadn't run into the real psychos yet	2602	B
there's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these Soviet states	2602	B
if uprisings happen- happen in their sectors	2602	B
it is it's going to be a total blood bath	2602	B
actually they're showing remarkable restraint	2602	B
they get real nasty the Hyundee helicopters come out and they	2602	B
would level entire areas	2602	B
okay you're from the Dallas area right	2602	B
okay you know basically the size of uh the area around Richardson	2602	B
you put five Soviet Hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive	2602	B
and they can do that in about four minutes	2602	B
and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by	2602	B
they used them in Afghanistan did remarkably- remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in	2602	B
but on a highly populated area like some of the Soviet cities would be	2602	B
with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide	2602	B
if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the then the nerve gas definitely will get you	2602	B
the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time	2602	B
they drink that much fuel	2602	B
were you have you i take it you haven't spent any time in the military	2602	B
as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military	2602	B
i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in never did make the newspapers but	2602	B
during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that i mean they're getting all these weapons and stuff	2602	B
didn't it	2602	B
it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff	2602	B
in any of them since eighty one	2602	B
it all boils down to whether it's our side their side it's a matter of money to a certain extent	2602	B
the deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil	2602	B
uh the ones to the south are more regional conflict	2602	B
they're not really that worried about	2602	B
invading north	2602	B
they're more interested in they've got a screwed up situation i'll give them that	2602	B
from Mexico all the way down into Central- Central and South America the situation down there is weird and it's very screwed up	2602	B
inflation is out of this world and the governments which	2602	B
our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out	2602	B
and generally the people are getting screwed and they're tired of it and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism	2602	B
unfortunately Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard	2602	B
that's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing Gorbachev has made his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself	2602	B
Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard	2602	B
so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point	2602	B
you mean i understand when they pulled the troops out of uh	2602	B
or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down i thought that was great	2602	B
but by no means do i	2602	B
endorse or approve pulling everybody out	2602	B
it may be	2602	B
a much reduced force than what we used to have over there	2602	B
but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict	2602	B
if	2602	B
United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is	2602	B
not only does it it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying	2602	B
if you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground	2602	B
go ahead	2602	A
um	2602	A
okay	2602	A
i guess i don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be but i think just the instability of the country right now uh-huh	2602	A
so scary	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
um uh-huh	2602	A
huh	2602	A
huh	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
yeah i guess that's what concerns me the most is they're they're so unstable that somebody like that could make uh decisions that would	2602	A
jeopardize a lot of people	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
yeah it looks like it's come close to that as it is	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
yeah	2602	A
huh	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
no i haven't	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
you mean in the in the most recent conflict	2602	A
oh yeah definitely i i'm i'm a little bit shocked to what the US has done in terms of selling to Iraq	2602	A
in the past ten to fifteen years	2602	A
yeah i think we we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too it's bad enough that the Soviets do it	2602	A
um uh-huh	2602	A
yeah it's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons	2602	A
especially when it's to the south of us	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
yeah	2602	A
well i think Russia is getting to the point where they're they're about to do something to get out of communism i guess i'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin	2602	A
to get more power i think Gorbachev has about had his day	2602	A
yeah	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
uh-huh true	2602	A
i don't know i sure wouldn't turn my back on them	2602	A
uh-huh	2602	A
at least they're learning a little bit from history i mean uh	2602	A
well about the only thing i know is uh one of my um friends at work uh has um one little boy and she's about to have a second baby and i hear some of her um	2633	B
tales about trying to get uh child care now she doesn't like to use some of the places like um Kinder Care La Petite Academy she likes to just find individuals you know who take children into their home	2633	B
and uh you know sometimes they have found somebody by word of mouth other times she has to go through the newspaper and see what she can find	2633	B
there are some um like um oh Chamber of Commerce you can kind of call there are some places like that that will give you some referrals at least	2633	B
but she just kind of goes and uh meets people that she sees advertise and and interviews with them and ask them their	2633	B
ways	2633	B
oh	2633	B
ah	2633	B
yeah there's been a few people that have kind of used the same person kind of like word of mouth one person in the department had them and	2633	B
then um you know other people had followed and had the same one as their child grows like some people only want little infants you know and when they get to two years old	2633	B
they don't want you know a whole lot of two years old because they're a little more active so they you know a lot people in the department seem to have used like the same couple of woman as their their children uh grow but	2633	B
i really keep thinking that T I ought to come up with something like through Texins to have you know some kind of facilities there at work because it really is uh a lot of extra pressure on our working parents	2633	B
no i think it should be done through Texans i mean i understand that	2633	B
that that TI wouldn't want to have liability for that and i can understand that i work in the legal department i don't want anymore lawsuits than what we got	2633	B
but but you know i think that they could work out something with Texans something that would be close to work	2633	B
because i think that would help ease things too if you've got your child somewhere close because i see these people you know dashing out the door	2633	B
um have to be out by a certain time because they have to go pick up their child if they don't pick up the child by a certain time then they run extra money you know to uh have late charges	2633	B
and uh you know Texins is is not uh well i don't think it's	2633	B
really directly supported by TI i think it has it's own kind of funding but something like that that you know you would have to be a TI or a Texins kind of um does it	2633	B
well how would i do that	2633	B
well uh again i know from the person who um you know is a friend ever mine at work	2633	B
she and i i've talked to her after she's interviewed some people just really sound i mean bizarre i mean you can't imagine that these people are putting in for um you know minding others' children um like if you could go to the house and	2633	B
it seems to be in a disarray and the woman really isn't even dressed and it's afternoon and and you ask her about you know previous children and she won't talk about it	2633	B
kind of go okay um	2633	B
others if they have some way of handling like i kind of wonder about these women who take in children there are times that you're going to have to do you know for the women they're going to have to do some personal things themselves i mean	2633	B
every single day they may have you know every once in a while they may have some kind of um personal doctor appointment or got to get the car fixed or something like that how do they do that	2633	B
so you ask them do you have a fall back you know for those times are you going to put me in a bind or do you have somebody else who can take care of the kids or do those things for you on the times that you need to you know have personal time off and do those items	2633	B
and ask them you know who else uh have they you know uh baby sat for in the past and can you talk to them look at the facilities and ask them what kind of things they do to you know during the day with the child that kind of thing i guess	2633	B
uh-huh	2633	B
hm	2633	B
hm	2633	B
uh-huh	2633	B
hm oh do you know one time i um we just got married a couple of years ago and there was people that were coming you know into town with uh children	2633	B
and i wanted you know babysitters for uh the service and and available to them if they didn't want to bring their children or you know get away and stuff and i just called in the from the Yellow Pages you know uh babysitter uh outfits that are	2633	B
um again must have some kind of licensing or whatnot and uh just had them i mean	2633	B
uh i	2633	B
thought i checked into it one time just pre planning	2633	B
and it can run like a hundred dollars a week i think my friend who now has a uh a two and a half year old she spends about fifty to sixty dollars per week for him so i think it's anywhere from like fifty to a hundred depending on the place you take	2633	B
yeah yeah it gets to be kind of expensive and i think you know some of the woman do uh weigh that um	2633	B
we've had some that have had their children and not come back so it just depends i think uh well we have one now who um is is part time she works uh half days actually we have two one paralegal and one secretary	2633	B
and one attorney each have very young children and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these people work part time	2633	B
uh depending on the responsibilities that we're giving them and to see how that will workout because they all want to you know still have a little income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their children so they're part timers	2633	B
and it for the one that's working with me it's working uh very well i don't have any problem with that i have one that's um helping me out at um for the litigation we're doing	2633	B
and she's there uh three days a week and this that seems to be fine i can handle that very well with her being there only half time	2633	B
oh	2633	B
yeah well it's whatever they feel comfortable with you know basically whatever they feel best and there's probably some women who	2633	B
may not do their child any good being there all the time because you know they they they can't uh quite see themselves you know dedicated that much	2633	B
maybe they want to work a little bit whatever it is maybe they should think about do you really want a child or not	2633	B
and maybe again you know their their you know their ideas change once the baby is there they go oh well you know now i like this a lot more than i thought i would	2633	B
but uh Cathlene the part timer she says you know she just doesn't she she's always one of these workaholic kind of people and she just really can't sit still enough	2633	B
to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else she's always been one who's put in	2633	B
you know like the fifty to sixty hour work week and after she had the baby she was coming back in to check her office and to check her in box you know like ten days later she was back in and we were like Cathlene you got two months off you know you don't have to be back in there she's just	2633	B
always back in there and she's a she she just finds it very hard to um you know tone that down even though she's a part timer she still will put in time on Saturday	2633	B
do you have any uh personal experience involving child care services	2633	A
right	2633	A
uh-huh	2633	A
i have a friend at work yeah whose whose wife does that she takes in kids and- i think they're regulated by the state as to how many they can take in at one time	2633	A
so i'm not sure how anybody checks up on that but um i think there's a maximum number of kids that they can take care of at any one time	2633	A
yeah	2633	A
well- do you think it ought to be subsidized by the company	2633	A
something you can sign up for and pay	2633	A
sure	2633	A
right no i don't think that the company should be subsidizing services like that	2633	A
sure	2633	A
yeah i think that would take care of any questions about competency for people running the show	2633	A
uh if say if you were in the in a situation having to locate a uh child care center how old you go about determining whether somebody was competent or not take care of your kids	2633	A
i think that's a big question	2633	A
yeah you um pretty much by word of mouth uh somebody recommends somebody else but if you didn't know anybody uh how how lengthy an interview would you conduct with the person taking care of your kids to determine whether they're fit to uh handle it	2633	A
yeah uh-huh	2633	A
yeah	2633	A
yeah- there there are some services that uh	2633	A
that are very expensive uh for uh typically subsidized by uh large companies for some of their uh uh important employees	2633	A
where if they can't get there regular uh sitter or a child care service to take there kids if they reserve slots with these other um companies um very expensive rates but they can drop their kid off uh at uh one of these places for	2633	A
so it i don't know what it cost but it's extremely expensive and the companies uh have to uh reserve X number of slots uh per year they can't send anymore it's it's pretty much for for their	2633	A
for their uh uh some some of their employees uh lawyers do that a lot um i've heard about this type of service in uh places like New York City where people are uh real busy but if uh	2633	A
if they can't find the regular sitter they- they if- if the company has uh slots available in this uh service uh these employees can drop their kids off there	2633	A
yeah	2633	A
great	2633	A
uh-huh do you have any idea what uh what the regular uh uh services cost like La Petite or Kinder Care	2633	A
i guess you have to weigh the financial benefit of having somebody else take care of your kids if uh the working wife can uh make uh more than enough to handle that expense i guess it's worthwhile	2633	A
uh-huh	2633	A
yeah	2633	A
uh-huh i know some woman who are very career minded as soon as they have their kids they're back at work the next week but	2633	A
yeah pretty much so but other other than that i know some also who's claim that uh after they have their kids or started having kids they're going to quit their job and uh dedicate their time to raising the kids right	2633	A
according in in putting it in their words	2633	A
and staying at home so i don't know i guess each way has it's advantages	2633	A
uh-huh	2633	A
yeah good question	2633	A
uh-huh	2633	A
uh-huh	2633	A
okay	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
uh	2699	A
right now i have a Nissan Sentra and it's my first car and so i'm really i really have grand designs on on my next car	2699	A
uh just the about two years now yeah yeah so	2699	A
oh probably another year another year or so i'm i'm working in Waco and so i probably won't buy another one until i get another job	2699	A
so but this one i mean i like this one a lot um if i were to get a new car i it may be a Nissan- a another uh Nissan	2699	A
something	2699	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right	2699	A
i've always heard that the foreign cars are are the you know foreign cars or the Toyota and Nissan they have good mileage it's better and they last and last my mother has a Toyota and she's she's going on about a hundred and fifty thousand miles	2699	A
on it and it's still trucking so i she's sticking with it	2699	A
um i think i probably want uh a kind of a sportier car the one i have now is gray and i like black	2699	A
and probably like tinted windows and a nice stereo system tape player i don't have a tape player in mine which is really killing me	2699	A
uh yeah	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right	2699	A
right	2699	A
right the problem with that in Waco is there's not many stations and so you pretty much depend on tapes and CDs etcetera and so on because there's not a whole lot of stations to listen to um	2699	A
what	2699	A
pretty much yeah i not in my own personal car i drive a lot in my uh company car	2699	A
um my personal car i usually just drive to work and back or to the mall or something but not a whole lot i do drive back and forth to Dallas a lot in that car	2699	A
and that's probably wearing it down quite a bit	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right	2699	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2699	A
if you were to get another kind of car what would it be	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right	2699	A
right	2699	A
i do tend to like riding in American cars i've just never had one so i i can't really compare	2699	A
right	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
the big problem with a foreign car my father he drove or he always forever and ever he's had Audis and those German cars and they're so expensive to get fixed	2699	A
and that that's a big	2699	A
big uh minus sign for the foreign cars	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
yes	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
yeah	2699	A
i think i've got my eye on a Maxima when my price range is in reach	2699	A
so	2699	A
what do you think about the about all the new vans that are out	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
yeah	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right up uh-huh	2699	A
but it it it would seem to me as if i was sitting in a bullet	2699	A
of some sort and i'm right in the front you know it's	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
right	2699	A
uh	2699	A
i don't know i think i'll probably be hanging on to my Nissan for a while i guess here	2699	A
move up as i move up	2699	A
so	2699	A
i haven't had to put any tires on it and they're they're still they still have tread on them and everything i probably will have to change them here soon but	2699	A
right right	2699	A
uh-huh	2699	A
yeah this car i haven't had any problem at all except for uh a couple of weeks ago the it completely like shut down and it really shouldn't have done this because it's it's relatively new car	2699	A
and it completely shut down it wouldn't it just started going it went in drive and just kept driving i would put it in rear it kept going straight so i just drove it to the Nissan place and they said that it looked like i'd bumped something underneath the car	2699	A
and i knew i hadn't bumped anything but i had taken it to Sears for an oil change a couple of days before and i'm thinking they did took a screw out or bumped something or something and	2699	A
exactly that's what i was thinking because i know i haven't done anything to it and so i really haven't had any other problems except for that which i don't think would have been a problem	2699	A
had i taken it somewhere else or something	2699	A
but yeah i haven't had any problems at all	2699	A
yes yep	2699	A
oh yeah it's been good talking to you too okay thank you bye-bye	2699	A
all right so uh automobiles huh yeah what uh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
uh-huh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah huh uh-huh	2699	B
yeah uh is it a how long have you had it	2699	B
about_1 two years yeah i see how long it be before you're ready to buy another one	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
i see well	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah that's you uh you like driving that uh that particular brand of foreign car huh yeah yeah we we drive uh American cars right now our our daughter drives a uh	2699	B
a Toyota but we both drive my wife drives a Cadillac and i drive a Chevrolet	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
right yeah	2699	B
uh-huh	2699	B
yeah but	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
uh-huh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
oh yeah yeah that that makes a makes it a little different i i i would- i thought it would make a difference when i got my car it has a tape player in it but i don't use it a lot	2699	B
but i do listen to the radio all the time i like having that stereo radio with the it's got the equalizer in it	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
right	2699	B
uh-huh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
do you do a lot of driving or just- just-	2699	B
uh-huh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
well our	2699	B
i guess we could say my wife's car is the family car and we don't you know she drives it to and from work it's about it's you know what the most of its driving is my car is my business car and i drive quite a bit you know in my for my business role	2699	B
well i probably will stick with an American car American made car i i like the size you know the little bit larger car	2699	B
and uh we do tend to travel a bit and it's we just enjoy the you know the ride better for for longer trips	2699	B
and uh so	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
so yeah i've had i haven't had a a foreign car myself you know for my own personal- personal use in a long time i had a little Volkswagen Beetle one time	2699	B
um-hum	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
right yeah	2699	B
yeah yeah i have some uh i have some business acquaintances that drive Jaguars and uh you know i really like the looks of those but	2699	B
uh and i rode in one of them uh not too long ago and it it has a pretty good ride at least riding in the backseat was pretty good you know so	2699	B
and uh so it you know its when i when i move up a little bit in uh in price range that you know that's what i've kind of got my eye on is you know is maybe looking at one of those but	2699	B
uh-huh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
well i i'm not uh really not too interested in a van myself i have seen you know seen them running around town	2699	B
uh i'm not too crazy about the looks of them and they look like some of them look like they might be dangerous you're so you'd be sitting right up on the front with a lot of glass	2699	B
that	2699	B
right	2699	B
yeah yeah but then you know there's a i think one of them does have a a little more of a front end on it	2699	B
but then uh then some of them i like the looks of that better you know to have have a little more vehicle in front of you between you and the oncoming traffic seems to me it'd be a little safer	2699	B
yeah so	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah have you how- how about uh how do the tires last on that car have you had to put tires on i	2699	B
yeah i think that's	2699	B
yeah i think that is one of the things that you find on the foreign cars is that you know that some of the things that might cost you a little more but they last longer you know tires brakes and things like that might	2699	B
might last a little	2699	B
uh-huh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
huh	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah they might have let it let the the uh lift down with something underneath it so you know so	2699	B
yeah	2699	B
yeah so	2699	B
well it sounds like you you- you it sounds like you've got your plans all made though anyway to stick-	2699	B
stick with that car	2699	B
well it's been uh been interesting- interesting talking to you and uh uh well okay thanks uh-huh bye-bye	2699	B
oh no	2650	B
oh i bet	2650	B
oh i guess so have you lost him before	2650	B
uh-huh	2650	B
uh-huh	2650	B
what kind of a dog is he	2650	B
yeah	2650	B
oh boy he's a big one then huh	2650	B
yeah oh well i i hope he comes back that's too bad how long have you had him	2650	B
oh that's tough	2650	B
yeah you get very attached to animals don't you	2650	B
yes well you know they're always there for you and they don't talk back to you and uh it's kind of pleasant yeah sure sure	2650	B
yes we have a little- a dog a little white Lhasa	2650	B
and her name is Angel and we have a cat who a white cat he's he's just a Tabby just a and his name is Dominique we call him Neek but	2650	B
pretty good uh we've we had the the dog first and um	2650	B
she's kind of a wimp and and the cat kind of rules but uh uh she she likes him all right he we had another cat uh	2650	B
about two years ago it got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep and uh then we got this new cat so i	2650	B
i have two children and they really enjoy the animals and then my mother who is very elderly lives with us and she's really good friends with the dog they're very good buddies	2650	B
that's right	2650	B
that's right they don't care what you look like or what you act like they just love you unconditionally it's wonderful	2650	B
it's oh i know it has to be	2650	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2650	B
oh	2650	B
yeah	2650	B
oh that's really too bad that's awful well	2650	B
well i i'll i hope you'll find him you most likely will	2650	B
well have you put any posters up or anything like that	2650	B
um-hum	2650	B
uh-huh yeah	2650	B
um-hum um-hum yeah	2650	B
no you sure can't oh dear	2650	B
well that's good	2650	B
they can keep their eyes open yeah that will help well	2650	B
yeah	2650	B
yeah yeah he will i bet he does i know that it's hard on you i know that i'd be worried too	2650	B
yeah isn't it though that is that's	2650	B
yeah i know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night and	2650	B
when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him and and uh and if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared but he's always come back eventually so	2650	B
yeah	2650	B
yeah they can	2650	B
yeah	2650	B
yeah well but he's a real feisty guy he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them_1 on our property it's	2650	B
he's cats are really almost	2650	B
more territorial than than dogs are they just really do not want other animals on their property they're very very he he just any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't he won't	2650	B
jump at them_1 or anything but he'll sit and he'll watch and it and he i think maybe he would if it came real close but he's very protective of our property	2650	B
so	2650	B
uh-huh yeah	2650	B
well they're uh really a lot different than dogs because_1 they're not they're very independent and	2650	B
uh they're very he's- he's very affectionate when he wants to be but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll just he'll you know either scratch you or or run away um but when he wants to be	2650	B
uh he's really affectionate he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and	2650	B
and and snuggle up to you and but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him so but dogs seem to be always in the mood they're always you know right there and like like you to pet them_1 and loving and so	2650	B
yeah yeah oh	2650	B
yeah they do	2650	B
hm	2650	B
they sure do	2650	B
yeah	2650	B
is now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outside-	2650	B
and you have a fenced yard or uh-huh	2650	B
yeah	2650	B
well how did he get out	2650	B
oh boy	2650	B
um-hum	2650	B
um-hum	2650	B
um-hum	2650	B
right right	2650	B
um-hum	2650	B
oh	2650	B
yeah yeah	2650	B
well you know that animals are like that they like to roam and investigate and	2650	B
and see what's going on	2650	B
no no i'm sure that yeah	2650	B
yeah how are your kids handling it	2650	B
uh-huh	2650	B
uh-huh	2650	B
what's his name did you call Buddy we that's what's our cat's name that that that died oh yeah we named him uh uh we named him Buddy after uh Buddy Bell uh uh	2650	B
the Ranger baseball player that used to be here and we used to we were really into that when we got him	2650	B
going to the Ranger games and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason but Buddy after Buddy Bell so but he was he was a good cat too we miss him a lot and i feel- feel- i feel real guilty because	2650	B
we had him like for six years and one year i forgot to get his leukemia booster and he got it	2650	B
and i just felt so bad- i it's real contagious and it's and the vet said it runs rampant in this area and if they don't have their booster	2650	B
any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically like they get it if the other cat has it so	2650	B
oh oh it was terrible- i just felt terrible and i knew something was wrong with him because_1 his appetite was he was just real- getting real skinny	2650	B
okay this is really ironic that this would	2650	A
i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away and it's just	2650	A
been tearing me up all day because_1 we have just been looking all over for him we've been to the pound we've been to the humane society we've been to the adoption	2650	A
center we've just been all over the neighborhood we've been calling neighbors so this is just really strange that	2650	A
no this is the first time um he's gotten out before but he's always stayed right here you know he's never gone away and so this is just really strange you know because um	2650	A
he's part golden lab and part uh let's see Alaskan no not Alaskan i always forget uh Australian shepherd	2650	A
and yeah he's pretty big that's why it- it really surprises me you know that	2650	A
he hasn't come back because like i said he's never gone away like this before and	2650	A
i would think you know he might i mean he might could get hurt by a car or something i don't know that he could really get killed that easily because_1 he is so big you know but i don't know	2650	A
thanks i do too	2650	A
oh about two years so he's yeah it's really gosh	2650	A
that isn't that funny how we do i mean we just really	2650	A
yeah well they're companions you know they're really well do you have any pets-	2650	A
um how do they get along together	2650	A
um	2650	A
oh yeah that's what are so neat about animals i mean they are you know like i said they're they're really companions you know and they're friends you know i mean they	2650	A
you can love them_1 all you want and they love you right back and they don't yeah no i know it's just so neat you know it's	2650	A
that's i don't know this is just so hard it's just like i said we've had him for two years and he's never i mean he's he's gotten out	2650	A
but he's always been right there he's never been gone from at all you know he's just always been right there when he gets out you know it's the first time he's ever been gone like this	2650	A
uh i i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and	2650	A
and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were going to find him you know and when we didn't it was like oh no so i don't know	2650	A
yeah we keep you know they they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know and then	2650	A
well not yet we were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we	2650	A
we were trying to find some pictures of him recently we've got so many when he was a puppy	2650	A
you know but we just don't have a whole lot we have him on film you know on the video camera you know but you can't put that on the you know so	2650	A
so i don't know i we will probably will put some things up some posters and stuff up	2650	A
and hopefully that will help you know and maybe around the neighborhood but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood so that helps too you know if they can keep yeah	2650	A
so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that uh if he gets out he'll come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so	2650	A
nope	2650	A
well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to worry about them_1 you know if they're not right there	2650	A
is that right	2650	A
huh that's really i i guess i really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them so i never had them_1 growing up so you know i never really had them_1 around me you know so i've never owned one you know but	2650	A
huh	2650	A
huh	2650	A
yeah that's true i i like the way they come up and they'll	2650	A
well no well well he's outside during the day and then when we get home at night we do bring him in	2650	A
but	2650	A
he dug a hole under the fence well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and you know we we filled it back up	2650	A
put him back in there he did it again so we chained him up you know but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because_1 you know we feel like that's just too restricting for him so um	2650	A
we got we we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it	2650	A
you know so that he couldn't get out well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire so i can't i i i just have not	2650	A
i don't understand you know because_1 it's like uh he's got a good home you know he's got i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot you know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know we just couldn't	2650	A
yeah i guess that's yeah i guess that's probably true i don't think it's anything we did least i would hope not no i i know i mean he's always you know he really does have a good home i think that's what really	2650	A
well	2650	A
i don't know if it's really quite hit him hit them uh i have two girls and they they just been real um	2650	A
i don't know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now it's like um	2650	A
well if he doesn't come home can we get another dog it's like wait a minute you know	2650	A
poor Buddy you know i said he's only been gone a day and you already want to replace him Buddy um-hum	2650	A
is that right	2650	A
oh	2650	A
that's funny	2650	A
yeah it just-	2650	A
oh	2650	A
i didn't know that	2650	A
i had no- i had no idea i did not know that	2650	A
so tell me about Silence of the Lambs is it great	2670	A
right	2670	A
is it really that scary	2670	A
i i i uh i plan on probably renting it at some point in my life	2670	A
yeah i've got small children i don't get out to many movies	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
and that doesn't really happen it's only pretend	2670	A
oh	2670	A
uh-huh	2670	A
wow	2670	A
maybe i should go see it in a theatre and plan to go out to dinner afterwards so we could sit and talk about it	2670	A
oh	2670	A
yeah that's one of the best films i've seen in a long time	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
what	2670	A
what's your heritage	2670	A
oh	2670	A
yeah i've i've got quite a bit of Indian blood in me so	2670	A
some of it was um things that i had heard well both of i had two great grandparents that were full blood	2670	A
and but they were on opposite sides	2670	A
no one was uh Blackfoot and one was Cherokee	2670	A
and um so i knew	2670	A
a lot about just um	2670	A
oh the kind of respect they had for the earth	2670	A
that it was real it wasn't something i'd just read in books it was something i was taught	2670	A
and um	2670	A
and so you know like the the scene with the buffalo	2670	A
oh i cried that was horrible	2670	A
i i just i mean it- you know it that because_1 i know it happened over and over and over again	2670	A
and i mean it's just like we're raping our land now but	2670	A
um you know it was i i just thought that was one of the movies- best movies i've seen in so long because_1 it made me laugh i mean i was you know parts of it i was just almost in the aisles laughing over it and	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
yeah i think that it yeah	2670	A
tried to make people realize that um we can't close our mind to another culture simply because it's not ours	2670	A
and uh and it was so there was so much the Indians did teach us and there was so much more they could have taught us had we only listened	2670	A
yeah	2670	A
well i i think of the uh you know the the gang wars and the racial wars that we have now in so many of our cities and in our high schools	2670	A
that are basically the same thing acted out by a younger generation over	2670	A
uh you know they're fighting over things that	2670	A
are- to them are important enough to possibly die for	2670	A
and yet they just don't matter	2670	A
and you know i mean it comes down to that the land or the the territory or the you know the bathroom or whatever is there for everyone	2670	A
and it can be enjoyed by all if shared	2670	A
i mean but but that's what we did to the Indians we said	2670	A
you know we're afraid of you you don't you don't look like we do you don't talk like we do so we're going to move you out	2670	A
and and we offered reservations	2670	A
as	2670	A
you know consolation prize and they were a joke	2670	A
yeah	2670	A
yeah they	2670	A
yeah	2670	A
yeah but he who has the biggest stick is still going to win	2670	A
that's right	2670	A
hey all that counts in Monopoly is who has Boardwalk and Pork Park Place	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
yeah	2670	A
yeah i definitely ought to get in on a rental then because people would look at me in the theatre going what is this woman doing	2670	A
really	2670	A
man-	2670	A
goodness	2670	A
yeah this is going to roll right off my side-	2670	A
oh that's great	2670	A
i'm going to have a hard time waiting for it to come out on video now	2670	A
yeah	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
yeah	2670	A
it's very scary	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
um-hum	2670	A
yeah	2670	A
yeah yeah i do too oh yeah	2670	A
oh what was it um	2670	A
the ones about um Von Bulows	2670	A
um	2670	A
oh the something about Portuguese-	2670	A
i liked it i really did actually i saw it twice my roommate- ex-roommate and i were	2670	B
i mean you know real psychotic people so we were dying to see it so we went and saw it and i had to see it the second time to get it all because i kept my eyes closed through so much of the first part	2670	B
well it's it's not that it's that scary it's that it's so graphic	2670	B
because uh how well are you going to see it i don't want to tell you how it ends	2670	B
okay so some time later much later huh	2670	B
okay well it's uh what is so weird about it is that it it's a real it's based on real people	2670	B
and i read the story in People magazine about where they got the characters in the movie and they're a combination of a lot of different serial killers in real life	2670	B
and so a lot of things that happen in the movie the only thing really scary about it is that it could happen to you	2670	B
it really does happen in real life you know normally- normally in movies you can look at it and say well it's a movie	2670	B
right	2670	B
right but in this you're going i i would have done that i can see where that would happen	2670	B
and it's it gets really scary but it's it's a real interesting movie very thought provoking there are so many things to discuss when the movie's over	2670	B
if you're one of those people that likes to discuss things and and think about why it happened	2670	B
i i still talk about it with we'll call each other every now and then and go remember when in the movie this happened well i was just reading today and and things just keep relating back to it i thought it was fascinating	2670	B
maybe just go out for a soda or something	2670	B
i don't think you want to eat	2670	B
it it is real good though it's- it's uh i liked it i liked Dances with Wolves too though that was a real good movie	2670	B
yeah	2670	B
i didn't think i'd like it i don't normally like the uh the old West type movies things like that the	2670	B
they don't normally interest me but that one i really really liked because_1 it it i didn't know so much about the Indians and all that	2670	B
that happened in that part of the war	2670	B
i had never heard anything really about that before and this was a whole new idea to me anyway i thought it was real good	2670	B
um	2670	B
i'm about a quarter Italian and my grandmother on my mother's side is a little bit of everything	2670	B
typical American little bit of Indian little bit of this little bit of that	2670	B
and that's about it	2670	B
what	2670	B
do you	2670	B
oh really	2670	B
which	2670	B
which one- were they Sioux Indians or what were they	2670	B
oh neat	2670	B
right	2670	B
right	2670	B
uh-huh	2670	B
that was awesome	2670	B
oh i did too i did too	2670	B
yeah	2670	B
um-hum	2670	B
it makes you realize how really ignorant some white people are people who have no ethnic background no heritage anything other than just typical Americans a little bit of everything and they don't really know	2670	B
they don't know anything about the Indian people they don't know anything about the Europeans that came over	2670	B
you know it it really made it seem like we are so in the dark on so many things	2670	B
right exactly	2670	B
uh-huh	2670	B
and i still really other than just basic ignorance of prejudice i don't understand why we didn't	2670	B
why them why did we not listen to them	2670	B
i've never	2670	B
yeah- well yeah but isn't isn't it sad to think that that much- that greed can do that much to you or to a person	2670	B
i mean they we wanted the land and we didn't want them to have it so just screw everything they're going to think and teach us and tell us and and we could just like wipe out an entire	2670	B
people like that	2670	B
that's that's sad	2670	B
right	2670	B
uh-huh	2670	B
right	2670	B
right	2670	B
right	2670	B
right	2670	B
right	2670	B
right	2670	B
right	2670	B
right that is that's a good way to look at it a consolation prize that's about all it was	2670	B
that's really sad that things like that can still happen today after all this time	2670	B
you would think we'd a learned something by now	2670	B
yeah that's true	2670	B
he with the most toys	2670	B
i guess	2670	B
i really did like Silence of the Lambs though that was really an interesting movie i	2670	B
i liked Dances with Wolves but it was a more- an emotional like you get real involved and you cried and you feel real sorry for the people you know and all this but in Silence of the Lambs it was kind of that Fatal Attraction did you see that	2670	B
it was kind of that feeling through the whole thing on the edge of your seat wanting to tell the people what to do next	2670	B
you know you're like no don't go in there don't give him your name you you just- you start acting it out for them	2670	B
no believe it or not the whole theatre got involved i mean yes in fact i'm trying to i can't remember which scene it was but at one point everyone in the theatre clapped	2670	B
they were so happy it was it was- and i thought i was just there and i heard other people crying when i was crying	2670	B
there were certain parts in there that were real sad and you hear people when you know the the actors are doing things that you know are about to reap some bad thing and	2670	B
it was- i i think everybody felt that way through it it was very- real involved	2670	B
and all the girls were crying when they walked out and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that didn't bother me and you know it did	2670	B
i	2670	B
right i remember the first time i saw it was with my boyfriend	2670	B
and he was joking with me about how i wasn't going to watch half of it i was going to close my eyes	2670	B
and there were quite a few scenes where i did but this one scene i knew something bad was coming i could tell so i ducked my head	2670	B
and about that time i heard the audience go and my boyfriend jumped	2670	B
he literally jumped and he swears he didn't do it and i felt him jump	2670	B
and	2670	B
it really was to this day i tell him he was scared and he says no no you you just didn't watch it you should have watched it it wasn't that bad	2670	B
i'm like yeah right that's why you jumped	2670	B
yeah really it is a great movie you got to see it	2670	B
it's so fascinating to think that there are people that are so	2670	B
so smart they're such geniuses that they've cross that line and they're they're psychotic and it's amazing	2670	B
it really is i mean to think that it could be anybody we know i mean you could be	2670	B
walking right next to one of them_1 and not even know it because they look perfectly normal i mean this man was a doctor	2670	B
and he had patients in fact they were the people he killed you know and you think right now your doctor could be wacko	2670	B
he could be some psychotic killer and no one would ever know	2670	B
it's just strange but that that was what was that was what made the movie because it's so real	2670	B
i like movies that are based on on things that are real	2670	B
oh what was that	2670	B
well pretty much uh the thing i'm into mostly is new age uh like Yanni um oh uh Peter Barden uh	2656	B
gosh there's just so many of them i can't even can't even name them all Enya i just got a catalog just now as a matter of fact uh actually my husband got it uh Lady Slipper Catalog and it's it has music from a lot of women	2656	B
and it's got uh Enya in it and Carol Nessin have you ever heard of her	2656	B
well actually most of the music that i listen to there's no theme it's it's instrumental	2656	B
um and i tend to like instrumental better because there isn't that underlying theme there's no message to be get to be gotten there um it's just enjoying the melody	2656	B
that's that's what i like about music	2656	B
well um i guess you could tend to categorize some of the stuff like i like in into jazz uh Jean Luc Ponty	2656	B
is he's kinds of a he's he's jazz but he's kind of more of a contemporary type jazz he's got the um the electric violin	2656	B
um	2656	B
um my husband just said before i switched to this other phone he said so you like the Dixie Dregs and that's is another one of my favorite groups	2656	B
but it's they're kind of in a group by themselves really	2656	B
they're more they're more like progressive	2656	B
um no progressive music is more like they have real complex um uh rhythms and key uh key changes	2656	B
um	2656	B
it's it's a more complex it's it's not your your typical top forty type that has um it'll it'll be in a particular key or whatever and it- it doesn't change	2656	B
um progressive has a lot of different um	2656	B
i don't know it's it's a lot more complex	2656	B
no no uh that's really	2656	B
a lot of groups don't like to be called new age because it's kind of a a label that it it kind of kind of connotates the out of body experience like the	2656	B
um Shirley MacLaine type thing and that's not it at all	2656	B
it's it's just	2656	B
a different type of music and i guess	2656	B
um i guess you would really call it contemporary jazz	2656	B
i think so um do you ever listen to one oh six	2656	B
um	2656	B
um they play some of the stuff that i like although they've gotten them- they've gotten to a lot more into the saxophone stuff and i don't really care a whole lot for saxophone like um Kenny G	2656	B
he's okay but um i like more of a variety and it seems like they are playing all of this saxophone type music that enough is enough you can only handle so much of it	2656	B
well yeah he's kind of a new age	2656	B
kind of a jazz new age	2656	B
it kind of kind of depends on how you look at it	2656	B
uh-huh	2656	B
what did you think of it	2656	B
uh-huh	2656	B
yeah	2656	B
i saw him in concert several years ago and he is puts on a really good show	2656	B
he really is incredibly talented	2656	B
what what what kind of music do you like to listen to mostly	2656	B
uh-huh	2656	B
yeah	2656	B
yeah i i like top i liked Tom Petty until he got to be kind of top fortyish	2656	B
like his first two albums were really good they're real real you know nitty gritty down to the i mean real roots of rock and roll and i really liked that	2656	B
when he got to doing his um um didn't he do a he did an album with who was it Stevie Nicks i think	2656	B
and that was okay but i liked his early stuff a lot better	2656	B
yeah	2656	B
uh-huh	2656	B
uh-huh	2656	B
i like some classical except that i have a really hard time going to buy it because	2656	B
some of it is just really awful	2656	B
and some of it is really good and i don't know the good from the bad	2656	B
excuse me	2656	B
yeah	2656	B
yeah the one one classical piece that i really do like is Vivaldi's Four Seasons	2656	B
i really like that and i like i like some Beethoven	2656	B
um	2656	B
and that's really	2656	B
all that i've really sampled that i	2656	B
why i should say i i have listened to some others that i like that i can't remember their names offhand my husband makes all these tapes of all different artists and i never know what i'm listening to	2656	B
i just know that i like it	2656	B
i'd i'd probably put a CD on and i would i would probably probably most likely go to something new age i would probably Carol Nessin or	2656	B
um or Suzanne or somebody like that um once in a while i'll put on some classical	2656	B
um	2656	B
sometimes my husband has a whole variety of music so i really have pretty much anything to choose from	2656	B
um i do like a lot of the older stuff too but we don't really have a lot of the older stuff on CD	2656	B
um	2656	B
and that's pretty much all i listen to	2656	B
i i hardly ever listen to the radio anymore	2656	B
yeah	2656	B
yeah	2656	B
i live in Carrolton	2656	B
oh okay	2656	B
okay	2656	B
yeah	2656	B
okay great thank you	2656	B
okay	2656	B
bye-bye	2656	B
okay um what type of music do you like	2656	A
uh-huh	2656	A
no i have not what what is the the message what is the underlying theme of new if heard of new age music but i don't i wouldn't know how to identify it	2656	A
oh really	2656	A
what	2656	A
okay what separates that from something such as jazz music or you know	2656	A
uh-huh	2656	A
so	2656	A
okay they're progressive in that it's just the same- up beat tempo type or instruments they use	2656	A
uh-huh	2656	A
uh-huh	2656	A
okay what does this type of music have to do like when i go to the book store and i see new age books does this have anything to do with that	2656	A
uh-huh	2656	A
yeah	2656	A
okay	2656	A
okay	2656	A
that's that's good and is this becoming more widely available	2656	A
no	2656	A
yeah	2656	A
yeah so	2656	A
so you could label Kenny G as a new age	2656	A
okay i was wondering	2656	A
all right	2656	A
okay	2656	A
i i've listened to one of his disks probably about a month ago and and	2656	A
i thought it was talented i thought you know he's a	2656	A
you know has definitely a lot of talent and i i wouldn't buy it for myself but i was glad to listen to it you know i'd	2656	A
seems like he does	2656	A
yeah well that's cool	2656	A
um	2656	A
i'm very um open i listen to a little bit of anything i've got	2656	A
i listened to rock and roll a lot when i was growing up so a lot of the groups that have been well established for a long time such as you know like Tom Petty or you know the Eagles	2656	A
i know most of their stuff and i continue to purchase you know their latest releases as long as they you know they don't sell out and still stick within their you know their certain style	2656	A
yeah	2656	A
yeah	2656	A
yeah yeah he sang a couple of tracks on one of her albums	2656	A
yeah i was really i'm really impressed with his latest	2656	A
the what was the name of the latest album i have it it's um	2656	A
i like it you know it's you've got some top forty hits and i'm sure you know he's geared to that but there are some songs that are pretty cool on that and you know with the videos and stuff now coming out	2656	A
he may be softening up little bit but you know i still like his voice and you know he's not you know it's not that bad um i also like Christian music a lot	2656	A
i like um	2656	A
i like orchestra i like symphonies classical music	2656	A
because	2656	A
right you don't know until you listen to it	2656	A
so	2656	A
yeah unless you have someone that can loan it to you or you go to the library and listen to it	2656	A
it's kind of hard just to	2656	A
yeah	2656	A
yeah	2656	A
so	2656	A
so if you walk into your home then you stick something in you're you're not sure what what would you stick in if you come home and just could you turn on a station or stick in an album or disc	2656	A
uh-huh	2656	A
well	2656	A
did you	2656	A
did you say one oh six	2656	A
has the new age station- now are you from- where do you live	2656	A
okay we live i live in Sherman so i'm not sure if i'll i can receive that station or not but i will try and i'll you know listen for a while	2656	A
and see what it sounds like Stephanie was it	2656	A
well uh thank you very much for talking and uh maybe we'll get hooked up again sometime	2656	A
all right talk to you later	2656	A
bye	2656	A
okay um yeah one year public service for everybody	2604	A
is that that was it right	2604	A
i don't know i've been i've been sitting here thinking here because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this um	2604	A
uh i mean the first thing is the oh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but	2604	A
you know senators' sons and all that stuff too i mean everybody's got to do it um	2604	A
i don't know it'd probably be it'd probably be good i just don't know if you know if i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
yeah is um	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
well i guess it's going to depend on how i mean if if you're talking about any if you're talking about something that's like a full time	2604	A
you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know you're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean	2604	A
i you know i don't know	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
well and- and also you know you you you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something in it	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh definitely	2604	A
right	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
oh uh that would be a nightmare	2604	A
and just i mean just getting getting it going	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
no- uh no	2604	A
not yet	2604	A
about_1 six months we will	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
yeah they have that here um they've got um in most of the states around here i think uh	2604	A
you know down in North Carolina there was a big controversy for a while because_1 the uh the local chapter of the KKK wanted to uh	2604	A
um to participate in it and uh there was a	2604	A
yeah well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know should these people be allowed to or not i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed	2604	A
yeah i think Virginia's got it and i know Maryland does and we just we went to Indianapolis last weekend and back and um i'm pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in Ohio and Indiana- Indiana about it and Pennsylvania maybe Pennsylvania	2604	A
i don't remember for sure now	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
yeah and but then they lost too much business	2604	A
uh-huh well the thing about that is though it's got a i mean because it was i mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that and	2604	A
you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue and i i'm worried that it it might you know it'll it the same thing will happen it's like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years and then people like well	2604	A
you know i'd rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know and even if it's not environmentally safe who cares you know	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
well	2604	A
yeah uh uh well wouldn't	2604	A
it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out	2604	A
of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are in Texas	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
right	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
right well my dad's in the in the solar energy business	2604	A
so um you know we're acutely aware of a lot of this but you know on the other hand he voted for George Bush so um you know i i wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing	2604	A
uh-huh	2604	A
yeah	2604	A
well the the thing with Bush	2604	A
right uh	2604	B
who wants to start this one	2604	B
right right	2604	B
i'm not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision uh i mean uh that that doesn't sound right	2604	B
um i guess i see overall beneficial if we're if we're just going from that point of view	2604	B
um i- you know in the past i don't know i don't know how old you are but when i was uh in high school was uh beginning of Vietnam and so forth and many of my peers were being drafted	2604	B
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever	2604	B
but i i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that that they could help the country in other ways	2604	B
be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available	2604	B
and i guess i see that as as not so much a a demand but but a privilege it's it's kind of uh uh	2604	B
it's something it's- it's since since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea i wouldn't mind doing it at forty four	2604	B
uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others uh and i i guess i i can't see that as being something to really object to	2604	B
i could see a a full a run a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that would- that could be done in an hour or two	2604	B
uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that in addition to what one does	2604	B
uh besides that i i can't imagine what kind of uh	2604	B
uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um	2604	B
back in the Depression the CCC the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but	2604	B
um i don't see that as being necessary now i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule	2604	B
uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps	2604	B
uh i i guess i see all of us benefiting and i i don't see it just relegated to the young	2604	B
but i see i i see so much going on that that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something that they turn back	2604	B
that's right you take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself	2604	B
and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county	2604	B
because then you're you're coming in contact with it it's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that i'll never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there	2604	B
it's so it almost needs to be something that has more	2604	B
impact for the individual on going	2604	B
but as far as putting that into work i don't want to i don't want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics	2604	B
yeah	2604	B
i i see a lot of things like uh scouting uh	2604	B
Boys Clubs Girls Clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and and i guess i don't see	2604	B
uh this being that different	2604	B
but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in	2604	B
do you have kids	2604	B
oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i- i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many kids- so many kids that were at loose ends	2604	B
and that didn't really have a purpose and i can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it	2604	B
i know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have but that's uh	2604	B
that- that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major PR campaign in each community each county	2604	B
uh parish or however the state was divided up	2604	B
hum i may well i don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for	2604	B
Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and keep- and i i've seen it in other states too i don't know	2604	B
um	2604	B
and there were those that said no you can't do that i'm sure	2604	B
yeah	2604	B
oh and i hadn't even thought about that uh the other- the other end of that that that's an interesting uh situation i hadn't thought of that	2604	B
we had visited relatives in Virginia not too long ago and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and	2604	B
and i don't know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last year- oh year plus i it was last- beginning with last year's Earth Day	2604	B
there's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and even- i work for Texas Instruments and they they've started some recycling campaigns that	2604	B
a year before that had been turned down because_1 they said well it's not feasible it's not a good idea	2604	B
and i see that as being	2604	B
i i see that as being a a a change um it for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing it's just thing	2604	B
a part of everyone's consciousness	2604	B
yeah	2604	B
i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life	2604	B
and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up but	2604	B
it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's	2604	B
burning out of control in in the Persian Gulf and and so forth just just every little bit does	2604	B
it makes me feel better it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth	2604	B
that's that's right because	2604	B
uh no no because if	2604	B
we what was it in seventy four when we had the the last last oil crisis and- and uh we started getting smart and and we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth	2604	B
and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way and we need those reminders	2604	B
uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology	2604	B
ah	2604	B
i'm sure you are	2604	B
well i this- you know just about anybody you could name whether i voted for them or not uh makes um uh	2604	B
decisions that i just can't go along with but uh that's why they're there and not me i don't want the i don't want the stress and the strain	2604	B
okay	2652	A
guess we can go ahead um well i guess you know it's you know since living in Dallas it's always so hot so in the summertime i just i wear lots of shorts so because i don't work during the day	2652	A
so do you work	2652	A
oh	2652	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah yeah and buying suits and stuff yeah because just being at home and i work at home so	2652	A
i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that i i don't go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know suits and stuff you know	2652	A
when i before i got married i you know i was working so i uh	2652	A
you know i i had more suits and stuff then but	2652	A
worry about all that kind of stuff	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
right	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
when you're training right yeah	2652	A
uh-huh moved somewhere i mean	2652	A
winter	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah because_1 i came from Wyoming and i had wool suits and wool skirts and	2652	A
you know i've got all these clothes that i never wear because_1 you just can't wear them_1 here and um	2652	A
the seasons are just so much different you have so much summer	2652	A
yeah	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah	2652	A
yeah	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah you hate to get rid of it because_1 you know how much you spent on them_1	2652	A
and it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff i know	2652	A
so	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
clothes yeah	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yes and they you take them out of the drier and they're wadded up in a ball	2652	A
oh i- i'm so glad to meet somebody that that their ironing board is their permanent fixture in their house	2652	A
you know i have very little furniture but my ironing board is part of my decor so	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah well yeah it is it is but it's like uh i just don't want to do it	2652	A
yeah	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah	2652	A
that's an idea oh yeah	2652	A
yeah i you know if i have if i know i'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room i will put it away but	2652	A
i iron our clothes as we go along so you know	2652	A
right no	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
uh-huh you can't iron it all and	2652	A
yeah and then with my kids they're always getting into you know they can't decide what they want to wear so they change their minds you know i know i mean my oldest is only four but she's	2652	A
changes her mind two or three times before she figures out what she's going to wear so	2652	A
and then they never put anything back	2652	A
so	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah that that that's called smart you know they don't we don't do that kind of stuff you know	2652	A
that's called too easy on mom	2652	A
our lot in life is to make her life miserable so	2652	A
um	2652	A
uh-huh	2652	A
yeah yeah i don't think i'd know what to do if it wasn't there you know my husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes	2652	A
you know	2652	A
yeah you know he wouldn't know where to put things so	2652	A
yeah so	2652	A
oh it was nice talking with you too	2652	A
take care bye-bye	2652	A
um-hum	2652	B
yes uh-huh yeah i do work um	2652	B
and but i work at a manufacturing plant so i wear a lot of blue jeans and T-shirts	2652	B
but normally i just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt very very comfortable i like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes	2652	B
um-hum	2652	B
um-hum um-hum	2652	B
right	2652	B
well i have plenty of suits and dress clothes because i- i'm like you when i first started working um	2652	B
i have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match and that kind of stuff	2652	B
but now that i you know work in the manufacturing plant then it's just it's so much more difficult for me to to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that	2652	B
than your normal garb but i'm like you too uh i moved from Ohio down to here	2652	B
and i had mostly polyesters and wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes and then of course you have to iron them all the time that's really that's been a problem for me	2652	B
right	2652	B
right	2652	B
um-hum	2652	B
that's true that's true	2652	B
well i know i was just now um uh putting away a lot of my winter clothes	2652	B
and i was going through here and i was thinking i haven't worn this in three years	2652	B
and because it's a wool skirt and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it and i have five or six wool skirts	2652	B
so i was thinking well maybe you know i need to think about getting rid of them but	2652	B
no i folded it up neatly and put it away maybe next year	2652	B
um-hum um-hum	2652	B
i know i agree with you	2652	B
well i know last year uh well this past winter it wasn't that cold	2652	B
but the previous winter we had more uh cold weather where i was able to actually wear your double and triple layerings of uh clothes yeah like you would when you're up north so	2652	B
that's really interesting	2652	B
yes yes yes and they're all one hundred percent cotton and	2652	B
yes yes i know so i uh i have my ironing board sitting out all the time i never put mine away	2652	B
it is it is	2652	B
that's true and and i've been looking at these um uh like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the um uh	2652	B
what the the the door and uh and then you can have- actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it permanently attached and that's what i'm thinking i'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom and it's just	2652	B
it's just an eyesore i think with all the	2652	B
hum-um hum-um no i've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet	2652	B
and and running you know a line in there for my iron so i could do it in there and i wouldn't have to have that eyesore	2652	B
yeah so i have a big closet	2652	B
um-hum yeah	2652	B
um-hum i no longer do that weekly thing because i have so many and i'm like you i the night before or that day i will iron whatever it is that we need and and that's it because_1 it's just too many hundred percent cotton	2652	B
um-hum	2652	B
um-hum	2652	B
um-hum	2652	B
right right oh i know i know	2652	B
no no of course not no that uh that would be too simple	2652	B
absolutely not	2652	B
that's right	2652	B
uh-huh absolutely absolutely	2652	B
oh	2652	B
that's right that's right you do you do so uh but yeah i uh i know several of my girlfriends though we uh we all keep our ironing boards out and just uh an ever present thing in our household so	2652	B
there you go things that need to be mended things that have to get ironed um-hum um-hum um-hum that's true	2652	B
oh well it was nice talking with you	2652	B
okay take care uh-huh bye-bye	2652	B
right	2646	B
um-hum	2646	B
right	2646	B
um-hum	2646	B
yeah funny how that happens after kids right	2646	B
um-hum	2646	B
yeah	2646	B
yes	2646	B
right	2646	B
right that's right	2646	B
right	2646	B
i imagine uh in in Texas there would be uh a lot of steak restaurants is that right	2646	B
yes	2646	B
um-hum and now on this area of course here in Maryland you're close to the Chesapeake there seems to there is some there are some steak restaurants but they lean more towards seafood here	2646	B
uh you probably have seafood a lot also	2646	B
oh is that right	2646	B
right well do you have crabs and lobster in that area that's	2646	B
yeah that's that's	2646	B
hum that's funny that they would	2646	B
right right right and you probably have crawfish- would you have crawfish	2646	B
yeah	2646	B
yeah	2646	B
well a lot of what you said uh sounds similar to us i remember that uh before- before we had children we have	2646	B
two boys that are like nine and six and actually the oldest one is just starting to	2646	B
definitely dine out more frequently probably several times a week and it didn't have to be	2646	B
necessarily anything fancy but it was more uh a matter of before children say we were both working we didn't feel like cooking we just went out	2646	B
and now you know as you said once you've children that's not always an option uh i worked off and on um you know because they were little and	2646	B
and and also you know once you're home and you have them um	2646	B
places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um	2646	B
when we do go out uh as you said you out on the town- now when we go out it's it's you want it to be more special	2646	B
you don't want to just uh necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us it's more when we do go out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends	2646	B
um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but	2646	B
um it definitely you know it definitely changes is changed we maybe eat in somewhat nicer places now but that's because when we do go	2646	B
and um but not as often we don't do it as often	2646	B
um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into going again with them	2646	B
and of course when you take them though you're going to go to something like a McDonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant	2646	B
uh	2646	B
but in this area there there are quite a few decent restaurants that are not too expensive and uh	2646	B
i- i- i tend to agree with you too we look for more um	2646	B
uh quiet type- more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in going to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise	2646	B
yelling and uh you know you look for different things and that crowd seems to change and you know you're not as much part of it	2646	B
um and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you don't necessarily have to go downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh	2646	B
there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's there's quite a selection in this area	2646	B
um-hum	2646	B
uh-huh	2646	B
um-hum	2646	B
oh i see	2646	B
yeah that's nice	2646	B
um-hum	2646	B
wow	2646	B
wow jeez well if i'm here also there's been such a growth in in housing uh not in the last year but before that it was just	2646	B
i don't know if you've been in this area in the last few years but it's just been incredible and and has it's gone crazy i mean where we are was basically a farm ten years ago and it's houses are stacked and what has happened really is that	2646	B
um some of the commercial um	2646	B
uh places have not caught up with the population here and so we do have a problem of the the half decent restaurants when you go on a Friday or Saturday night you're looking for quite a long wait	2646	B
and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time	2646	B
um the other thing that's changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that	2646	B
uh we haven't done it because i don't think it will work well with us having two boys but um some of the more expensive restaurants now i understand are catering	2646	B
um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in	2646	B
and they're doing this basically because they're so many working parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all these younger people were having children they weren't going to the restaurants	2646	B
dining out seems to be a uh uh something we do off and on	2646	A
through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and uh situations change uh we used to do	2646	A
quite a bit of dining out before the children and then as they came along and uh additional expenses sitting came into every dinner out um	2646	A
that that halted a lot of it as well as just the the uh oh i guess the lifestyle changes a little bit slows down a little bit and	2646	A
now even the atmosphere that that we would seek uh when we go out is often more quiet and uh	2646	A
a little bit more uh subdued uh not smoke filled or or bar uh dance floor type yeah so	2646	A
that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a a decent meal and	2646	A
and uh fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the immediate area that's totally really expensive you have to go a ways to get to a really	2646	A
high dollar uh hundred and fifty dollar dinner type deal which they're forty to fifty miles away and they're they're all around but they're just a ways so we can do a good um	2646	A
twenty twenty five dollar night out and have a decent steak and it comes out okay	2646	A
uh we look for i guess uh service uh you know i'm not i'm not in	2646	A
eating at McDonald's long enough the fastest the speed of it doesn't bother me you know i'm not looking for fast food at that night so the fact that it took them_1 twenty thirty minutes to get it there that's that's okay i'm	2646	A
that's twenty minutes away from the kids or however long you know you're out for the evening or it doesn't really matter that they not get it there right away but um	2646	A
have a little chime little hard time finding a place that'll cook the steak just right i have to remember how to ask for it for this given restaurant to get it just the way i like it without too much pink in there and uh get it cooked good	2646	A
yeah there seem to be quite a few quite a few	2646	A
um-hum steak and lobster type	2646	A
yeah they do oddly enough even being near- near the gulf uh they tend to advertise the the main	2646	A
the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're going to do to it you know like	2646	A
yeah- yeah yeah crab and lobster and and uh	2646	A
yeah they withdraw from that i guess you know you can ship stuff anywhere pretty much and uh	2646	A
uh probably i'm not a big fan of that so i wouldn't wouldn't be paying much attention to it um	2646	A
right	2646	A
um-hum	2646	A
right	2646	A
right	2646	A
uh-huh	2646	A
right	2646	A
there's a uh one place that	2646	A
really not sure if the marketing concept is is carried throughout it's chain but in this particular town um i live about two suburbs north of Dallas actually and in this particular town we're about two miles from this uh	2646	A
this steak house that has a	2646	A
oh i don't know a motif to the entire uh shopping center it's the anchor for this entire strip shopping center i guess and they'll the entire place is	2646	A
um has covered walkways all around to all the little shops that are they're not	2646	A
they're not even individual shops in some cases some cases are just kind of you they they put it all out in a little store shed out on to an area and then they put it all away at night um then there are there's one two whole rows actually of	2646	A
of just what we would call a stall of flat concrete place with little posts and they're all marked off with little lines and so if you want to rent this little spot though the farmers bring their stuff down and have a farmers market type	2646	A
so we went to this steak house once uh well several times but the most particular time that we were away from the kids and and had a a good length of time and it was on a Friday night and we knew the place would be really busy but we	2646	A
we got there about uh six or six thirty and put our names on the list of of the waiting list and then we walked around the uh the place that has	2646	A
there were still some farmers there at the time there was a lot of hand uh craft type stuff being sold uh there was a blacksmith and he's showing off his little traits and things that he could sell as well as uh	2646	A
uh the hallways between the places that were of of business the hallways were decorated with uh old pictures and history of the of the town as it were	2646	A
we killed about a an hour or so doing that because it was about an hour and a half wait to get into the restaurant and uh then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or so thirty or forty five minutes there and then	2646	A
uh came back out and walked around a little bit more and went home so it it's quite an interesting uh deal they don't even take reservations because they're so booked like that that uh	2646	A
hum	2646	A
right	2646	A
i haven't seen that yet i i i hear we	2662	B
a whole bunch of us were going to go see it the	2662	B
it's- it's playing at school actually in about- in about- in about two weeks i guess so we're going to go see that but you enjoyed that	2662	B
that's what i heard yeah	2662	B
yeah i've heard it it it's not one for the videos	2662	B
really	2662	B
um let's see well um this is almost sort of funny i was just at um	2662	B
friend and i went to see Out for Justice which is uh Steven Seagal	2662	B
because uh we're both big karate fans so we wanted to see what this is like and uh wasn't very impressed with actually	2662	B
yeah i wasn't i mean i've- i've seen his other movies and he i- i just think he's pretty good but uh this movie it's just i'm convinced now he can't act so	2662	B
oh his his- his- his karate's been pretty good i think in this one it wasn't so good i generally um movies like that scare me though i'd i'd be just fine without them because you know kids come running out wanting to beat each other up and you-	2662	B
fighting	2662	B
um-hum	2662	B
right	2662	B
yeah yeah well that that was number one for the week actually too so	2662	B
so it was a little bit uh i was thinking wow people must be	2662	B
into crime movies again	2662	B
but but in the middle of that conversation we sort of picked an um an an interesting point last year's number one movie for the year was Ghost	2662	B
i don't know if you saw Ghost or not	2662	B
except yeah and and and that was that that helped us sort of feel good about you know about ourselves and about that everyone around us in that	2662	B
in that um at least at least if everyone's- if if if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least they're still going to see the real good movies you know	2662	B
yeah	2662	B
yeah it was it was i was absolutely enthralled by it	2662	B
oh Patrick Swayze	2662	B
yeah he's- he's very good	2662	B
really i'm trying to think what else i've seen recently <b_aside> what else have we seen recently <e_aside> oh you know what's pretty cute actually	2662	B
um Defending Your Life	2662	B
have you have you heard of this	2662	B
yeah um i actually hadn't heard anything about it and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie	2662	B
and and they said it starred um Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks at first they told me and i thought what a strange combination Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep	2662	B
well actually it starred out that it that it's actually Albert Brooks	2662	B
so so it's lot better um Mel- Mel Brooks you you probably know is uh you know so it- it was a strange combination but it turned out to be a very cute movie i mean the whole premise is that they go out and they they die	2662	B
and and they have to	2662	B
right both of them are dead and they happen to meet in this this town um this this sort of city where you're set up such that you know they go and they decide if you can move up to the next level	2662	B
i don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull but it's something like that it's something like that they sort of move up to levels and and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough and as it turns out you know it's uh they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that	2662	B
so you can guess the rest of the plot it actually it's it's really funny because they run through you know they do it they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives	2662	B
and that's pretty good actually	2662	B
yeah and it oh that's that's what you do you actually have to go up there and you have a they have an attorney for you know attorney for you and attorney a a a defense and a prosecution and they have the	2662	B
you know the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level and the defense's job is to make sure that you you do you know and it's uh it's a neat little story actually	2662	B
i was i was- i was i i went- i went in thinking it'll be okay not great and then i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good so	2662	B
yeah	2662	B
hm	2662	B
the other world yeah	2662	B
well i'm i'm i'm sure because_1 it seems like it certainly would would- would explain the preoccupation with it lately i mean but i suspect there's always been a preoccupation with that sort of thing in movies	2662	B
right well	2662	B
well did you ever see um Flatliners	2662	B
that	2662	B
that that's probably one of those ones that you know	2662	B
it's- it's on video now i think and it's probably probably worth seeing on video um actually we really enjoyed it but it was it was it was also right along the same lines i mean they they would go ahead and kill themselves for a few three or four minutes to see what happens and	2662	B
almost yeah i i it's- it's- it's a little far fetched to find a bunch of medical students doing it but	2662	B
but it was um it was it was odd enough you know and the- and they didn't just sort of make it silly it was you know it was done fairly well i think so actually- i actually enjoyed that as well	2662	B
okay_1	2662	B
um-hum	2662	B
the story just sort of keeps going and going yeah	2662	B
yeah great well it was nice- nice talking to you {alrighty} bye-bye	2662	B
uh i don't go to movies a whole lot but uh i went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw Dances with Wolves which turned out to be an extremely- extremely good movie	2662	A
yeah it's it's something that uh my my brother lives over in Fort Worth and i was telling him about it couple of weeks ago and he said well i'll wait until it comes out on uh tape and and rent the the video and i said no this is not one that you want to do that with	2662	A
it's uh the the scenery and the the landscape and and the country that they're in needs a big screen it's just beautiful country in in the hills and the the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing it's just	2662	A
uh just an amazing amazing picture	2662	A
no it's it's one i think well you know every- every now and then you find one that you say yeah this is my favorite movie well this this is the one for me this time	2662	A
yeah what have you been to lately	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
uh-huh	2662	A
oh yeah	2662	A
is that right that was	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
uh how's his karate	2662	A
well they they do they get i remember when we used to go to uh see well i remember when Grand Prix came out when i was a kid and and some others movies like that we wanted to jump in the cars and and race	2662	A
and i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
is that right	2662	A
i did see Ghost yeah	2662	A
yeah i think that that Ghost was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good and it turned out to be an excellent movie	2662	A
i- i-	2662	A
i've forgotten the guy's name who was in it who had the lead role yeah and i especially like him uh	2662	A
he's a really- a really good guy	2662	A
other than that Dances with Wolves seems like to be the the only thing i've seen in the past several months to have any uh	2662	A
is that right i've i've seen the ads for it but i'm not really sure what it's about	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
that is a strange combination	2662	A
oh	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
oh yeah	2662	A
both of them	2662	A
uh-huh	2662	A
yeah years ago	2662	A
oh	2662	A
oh yeah and then defend it well i guess that's where the title comes from then	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
yeah it is it's	2662	A
yeah it's funny we've got a couple of movies out recently Ghost and Defending Your Life that have to do with	2662	A
uh after life i guess and it kind of makes you wonder i'm a also besides working at TI i'm a graduate student at here North Texas and working on a master's in communication	2662	A
it's the behavioral science part of communication and i i i think about these things and and people trying to define their own world view	2662	A
and uh what- what exactly do we you know do we see about this world or why are we so fascinated with the other world is it just supposed to be better	2662	A
yeah sometimes i think we we think it is and we like those things that way	2662	A
well it has all all the way through history there's uh i guess if you want to call it mysticism or the occult or whatever it's always fascinating- i guess because we don't know and there's no real way of finding out well there's only one way of finding out	2662	A
no i did uh did not the a girl next to me saw it and she really liked it	2662	A
yeah it is	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
yeah they say uh she said that this was uh almost believable that could really happen you know you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things and it you know you never know	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
i	2662	A
yeah i like it when they will- will do something and not get too silly i've been disappointed in some movies that	2662	A
um they don't know how to end it it seems like so then they get crazy and and it doesn't end like the story has been going	2662	A
yeah	2662	A
well i guess that covers our topic uh the	2662	A
nice talking to you bye	2662	A
okay	2629	A
yeah it is-	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
yeah that's what mine is	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
now i've got a portable cordless is that what you're using	2629	A

oh that's	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
yeah my daughter had one i wouldn't have one flying around my house	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
boy that's a shame	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
um-hum	2629	A
don't you miss them_1 now i mean	2629	A
because_1 they're they have such personalities	2629	A
um-hum	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
right	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
right right	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
yeah right	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
yeah you know you think you're you think that's what you want and i really gave it a good try	2629	A
and i had her spoiled i mean she was spoiled rotten but she was so	2629	A
and i have a new house and i and	2629	A
to walk in my house i'd have especially- uh especially on a rainy day i'd have to take a bucket of water out there and wash all four of her feet	2629	A
she still would come in so fast and so heavy that she'd dig her paws deep down into my carpet you know and just take out running to and she would	2629	A
oh she was ruining my carpet and i thought gosh i i love my new house more than i love her i think you know i just really have a big investment and i don't i just	2629	A
it was just more work than it was really- really i wasn't enjoying her that's what it was maybe if i'd a had a run for a dog run but i think that's cruel to put a dog in a run	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
but now see i have always felt that i could always smell cats	2629	A
cats to me always- i i i used to have some friends' house that i couldn't stand to go in their house i could smell their their litter box i thought oh my God i couldn't stand it and i don't know how they stood it i guess they didn't smell it	2629	A
oh do you	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
that's right	2629	A
well i wouldn't either	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
well i know is there're supposed to be is it Chihuahuas they're supposed to be good for asthma they say Chihuahua dogs are supposed to be good for people with asthma i always heard	2629	A
oh yeah and don't i think they're using you know they're using animals in old folks home now and make- and some hospitals because it's supposed to make people	2629	A
brings your blood pressure down you know dogs are always so happy to see you come home you know they always are just wagging i don't care how grumpy you are or what dogs are glad to see you	2629	A
cats are kind of independent like get in they're they let you live with them_1 you know so independent	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
oh	2629	A
oh	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
just to feed-	2629	A
oh	2629	A
uh-huh	2629	A
cost yeah	2629	A
i think i'll just go rent a horse if i want to ride one	2629	A
yeah i do too	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
no i mean well i do enjoy my dog uh she's such a	2629	A
oh she's my best friend and when when i lived in Orlando she uh got paralyzed from her waist down and uh waist	2629	A
and i thought it was uh	2629	A
uh we almost had to put her to sleep and i just cried for two days but i think what i- i- i ironically what happened was she got- had fleas	2629	A
and i think it was the stuff i was having- putting on her that that paralyzed her but	2629	A
the fleas i think's what brought her back is she had to scratch so bad that she started using her paralyzed- the the doctor was just amazed at a that she came back because	2629	A
he really was going to was going to do surgery for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep and i was going to have to opt to have to put her to sleep even as much- much as i loved her i wasn't going to spend fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment	2629	A
no but it was just uh that spot that they put on the back of a dog uh they used to use it on cattle and uh so i started using it on her and i'd take to her to the vet once a month and get that spot put on her	2629	A
and she wouldn't have any fleas never had any fleas hadn't never any then all of a sudden uh i took her	2629	A
i was living in Orlando and i put- i put her in the vet for- while i came home to Dallas for a while and i took and when i picked her up she had fleas again	2629	A
and so my daughter came down and visited me- me from Dallas and and while she was there the dog got paralyzed	2629	A
and so i took her back up to the doctor and	2629	A
anyway he he said it wasn't that but	2629	A
another doctor told me that there had been uh people the pet owners had been getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on them_1	2629	A
so i thought well and- so i can't find a vet that'll do that for me anymore put the spot on her anymore and i don't want it anymore anyway	2629	A
but i do fight fleas oh gosh	2629	A
yeah	2629	A
oh i moved back in eighty eight the December of eighty eight	2629	A
yeah i lived here before i'd worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Orlando uh with Mark and Marietta	2629	A
and let- let me talk about fleas we have nothing compared to fleas down they have down there	2629	A
and they have them_1 year round at least they die out kind of in the wintertime here in the yard down there they don't they're are just and they are big suckers i mean big	2629	A
and they are just almost impossible to get rid of it costs a fortune if you have a pet you're going to have fleas down there	2629	A
and i just had my house treated and treated and treated and treated and did- i did all the things you're supposed to and i couldn't get rid of	2629	A
what i was doing at- at home in fact i work at nights here so that's another long story we'll talk about	2629	B
it's funny that i got you though	2629	B
uh	2629	B
i asked my wife to hand me the other phone because_1 i was just i was busy and uh i had just gotten a call and i couldn't answer it and i said well i'll punch it on this one	2629	B
and uh it's a walk around phone but it's not a uh it's not the other kind you know	2629	B
so it didn't work	2629	B
okay	2629	B
no i'm using a regular phone now uh	2629	B
if if it's a what kind of phone do they talk- it's- not a dial but if it's a touchtone it's okay	2629	B
i realized that once i used i should have i was going to go in the kitchen and and punch one on the touchtone	2629	B
and i realized that i had screwed it up so it was my fault	2629	B
that's funny that we had gotten it	2629	B
uh i guess they want us to talk about dogs but dogs or cats	2629	B
i'll switch over to birds you know we we don't really have birds as pets but we sure because we have cats	2629	B
we always wind up with i haven't yet uh	2629	B
a bird or two in the Summer because the cat will catch one and usually we'll catch the cat because_1 the cat doesn't seem to kill the bird right away	2629	B
we wound up with a lot of birds over the years and	2629	B
there are organizations we drop ours off at Fort Worth if they're still alive and you keep it alive which is hard to do for a couple of weeks	2629	B
if you take it to an agency they'll send it back in the wild somehow and so we we wound up because of our cats with with many birds over the years uh again they're not pets exactly but uh	2629	B
yeah	2629	B
the lady next door across- from- across the street from us just lost	2629	B
is it a cockatoo what's that one that's white	2629	B
it got loose and i've forgotten what how she did it and she had it in a cage of some sort	2629	B
and what they were doing i don't know but it flew away you know and they called it and everything and rode- drove around the neighborhood looking for it but uh	2629	B
yeah it's free yeah	2629	B
i'm surprised that a bird uh i guess they can find their way back but i wonder exactly where a tame bird would go	2629	B
no no she never got it back i've heard stories like this before with parrots and all this uh because_1 people let them_1 out out in their house you know and fly around	2629	B
and	2629	B
no i know uh	2629	B
but uh i've forgotten she had it outside somehow and somehow they they mixed signals or something and uh it got loose of course again- again the animals are so much faster than we are in one way or the other	2629	B
uh you know i was telling you the story about fencing i do like dogs i i would i've always had dogs my whole life as a kid	2629	B
uh	2629	B
well yeah i do i	2629	B
yeah i do i think that all the animals have personality i'm not the cat person i my sister had cats when we were little	2629	B
we always seem to have a cat and a dog together which again when you bring them_1 up i do notice that	2629	B
they get along	2629	B
and my wife was the cat lover and when- when we started out as a young- young married couple we just had an apartment so you- it's kind of easier to have a cat	2629	B
and then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to Texas uh she's from Texas again and uh	2629	B
she- she had this thing with the fence and i i guess i have so many	2629	B
interests i don't really quite have the time with with two daughters and everything	2629	B
i- i i certainly saw your point with the Greyhound that there's there is a limit	2629	B
uh to a pet um	2629	B
um-hum	2629	B
yeah	2629	B
yeah	2629	B
yeah no i think so too uh my wife just she keeps convincing me because_1 my my parents uh my parents are dead now but my parents and my brothers and sisters always had dogs	2629	B
and when we would visit them she said you can smell dog over the house i said well you're really right	2629	B
and so i never she always had a good argument why not to get a dog and we haven't since we've been married	2629	B
yeah- oh yeah yeah	2629	B
uh no yeah- i think you're right uh people are surprisingly are allergic to cats too we do have some friends on and off that will	2629	B
i guess it's the hair- the cat the short fur on the cat is uh one of the allergic reaction things like uh	2629	B
cedar trees and all of the other stuff i guess the cat has a real fine not the that the real short hair dandruff or whatever they have that people do get allergic to cats uh	2629	B
in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats and they're crying	2629	B
and so some people unfortunately of course i wouldn't have an animal if i was allergic to it either	2629	B
uh my wife at one time said she was allergic to them_1 uh	2629	B
i was going to say a story-	2629	B
well i think the animal's good for you just because uh it gets you out and everything i uh	2629	B
oh yeah	2629	B
oh yeah	2629	B
right	2629	B
i have some friends uh uh that have horses you know	2629	B
and when my daughters were a little younger you know i thought well maybe that's a good maybe i'll get them_1 uh you know this is Texas and i'll get them_1 a horse	2629	B
well we went over and we rode their horses and everything but and and just listened to the stories and the money	2629	B
the horse was sick all the time	2629	B
you- i don't know if you if you have any friends with horses but they get all kinds of eating disorders if they don't if they don't eat the right grain or if you	2629	B
if you give him an orange or something you nearly kill it i mean it the the stories he would tell it must have cost him a couple hundred dollars a month	2629	B
of course he had several horses for shots and different things i thought my God and i just saw something interesting Consumer Reports they talked they had a animals- animals and they compared	2629	B
you know whether you should have a bird and and the pricing and it had a comment around a horse something to the effect of	2629	B
right i think the best thing in the world is to rent them i think that uh	2629	B
that- that and boats are probably the same way i'd love to have a boat too but i think uh i'm not too sure i i would get that much use out of it you know	2629	B
my goodness from what	2629	B
my goodness	2629	B
yeah	2629	B
oh yeah	2629	B
yeah plus i'm not too sure yeah i think they are experiments too and they don't know that much uh	2629	B
my sister spent a lot of go ahead	2629	B
huh	2629	B
hm	2629	B
my goodness	2629	B
yeah	2629	B
oh yeah they're they're a problem the the different rainy seasons here i don't how long you been here in in the area	2629	B
oh course you were here before	2629	B
yeah	2629	B
okay	2629	B
oh really	2629	B
yeah	2629	B
oh really	2629	B
oh	2629	B
oh yeah	2629	B
uh-huh i could never justify owning a personal computer at at home	2653	B
uh i mean that's quite an expense to look	2653	B
for uh well- well well who is this what do you do use yours at home for	2653	B
okay well now	2653	B
uh-huh	2653	B
oh	2653	B
uh-huh	2653	B
well	2653	B
excuse me	2653	B
i uh	2653	B
uh well i'm i'm a technician electronics tech and years ago TI sent me to their uh computer school down in Austin	2653	B
so uh i learned to repair one but you know i never really learned to operate one	2653	B
yes	2653	B
um-hum	2653	B
well uh space is a handicap with me i live in a motor home	2653	B
and i'm preparing for retirement	2653	B
hey i'm not too far from it another year and a half	2653	B
yes definitely the just like the computers	2653	B
uh remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars	2653	B
now	2653	B
i mean calculators- calculators i beg your pardon yeah	2653	B
you're kidding including a printer	2653	B
a hundred	2653	B
wholly smoke uh a respectable one	2653	B
well see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them_1 but i'm i'm that does amaze- amaze me	2653	B
um-hum	2653	B
hum	2653	B
well what what is a a a good brand a for- inexpensive	2653	B
huh huh	2653	B
oh wow	2653	B
um-hum	2653	B
hum	2653	B
i see how do you go about getting one of those uh catalogs	2653	B
um-hum	2653	B
um-hum	2653	B
well getting back to the PC's i'll tell you i uh first of all i don't like a machine that's smarter than me	2653	B
and secondly i learned- did learn this much about computers they're they're they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten	2653	B
in binary	2653	B
-well anyway that's one of my favorite jokes about that	2653	B
one and one equals ten	2653	B
course you- it's- it's kind of an inside joke you know	2653	B
you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary	2653	B
so what do you uh uh work with uh computers uh at TI	2653	B
uh-huh	2653	B
um-hum well i just recently started using one uh connection with my work	2653	B
uh i keep track of an inventory here and of course now that is where a computer is is very handy	2653	B
and	2653	B
well	2653	B
i it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated	2653	B
uh see i'm with the QRA lab	2653	B
qualification and evaluation so naturally our equipment has to be in in top condition and is constantly calibrated and they're dated	2653	B
so i have to keep up with them_1 uh and it's very handy doing it on the computer	2653	B
i just run a printout every week and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned	2653	B
so uh it it is handy	2653	B
and i must admit that up until i did start using one uh it was	2653	B
i had very little interest in computers	2653	B
but they are amazing	2653	B
well	2653	B
i think we did	2653	B
yeah Mike you take care now good luck to you	2653	B
so i own uh a PCAT at my home	2653	A
well that's actually a good question my wife works out of the home uh our home she has an office and it sits- actually sits in the office and she uses it to compose and print out letters	2653	A
so that's a a very regular use of it that she has	2653	A
and then in addition to that i tinker around with it i'm a computer scientist	2653	A
and so i write programs to do little things i'm actually working on a data base at home just just to keep track of things nothing special and also	2653	A
i'm interested in writing some programs that will you know kind of like remind me of things uh like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like	2653	A
although	2653	A
hum-um	2653	A
um-hum um-hum	2653	A
oh that's a key thing well actually there's- that's a there's really two issues to that that there's so many packages- software packages available today that just require no programming	2653	A
so that you- you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works	2653	A
but i think you- you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending out letters or if you don't	2653	A
want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage or whatever there your issue is then there really is	2653	A
oh i see wow	2653	A
i see well congratulations on that	2653	A
yeah well actually uh one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap that	2653	A
um-hum	2653	A
right oh the calculators you mean	2653	A
yeah uh-huh	2653	A
yeah they sure do	2653	A
yeah i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a whole- a whole brand new computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate one but a pretty good one	2653	A
for six hundred dollars	2653	A
no hm that-	2653	A
well actually- actually i wasn't including a printer but you- you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred	2653	A
yeah	2653	A
yes uh-huh um-hum	2653	A
yeah the prices have plummeted you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a a type of computer called an 8088 for about two hundred dollars	2653	A
and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty and	2653	A
well that's the that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs so there's uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one there's there's a magazine called Computer Shopper	2653	A
it's a it's a big magazine i mean it's it's twelve inches across- uh narrow the narrow side and and fifteen- fifteen- seventeen inches the tall side and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages but the book is the magazine is full	2653	A
of these mail order computer mail order houses and they're all competing with each so you just flip through there until you find a 8088 computer	2653	A
that's- that's called that's the original PC so it's be called a TI PC- i'm sorry an IBM PC compatible	2653	A
and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors for forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board- board for twenty five dollars which is amazing to me	2653	A
and just you mix and match and then you do it by mail order	2653	A
but there's no real brands there's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board	2653	A
they're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing	2653	A
you'll notice it in that it's it's a it's a very- it's although it's a magazine it's large and like i said it's about an inch thick	2653	A
that's right	2653	A
that's great	2653	A
oh yeah	2653	A
yeah that's great	2653	A
yeah	2653	A
i understand that's great that's a good joke	2653	A
well- what- i did for years and then i was was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing	2653	A
so i now i i type that one but i don't use it anymore	2653	A
i don't	2653	A
um-hum	2653	A
yes	2653	A
um-hum	2653	A
yes i agree	2653	A
oh yeah	2653	A
oh i see that's fascinating	2653	A
um-hum	2653	A
yeah	2653	A
um-hum	2653	A
right	2653	A
yes	2653	A
yeah they certainly are so let's see so i guess with respect to the question	2653	A
yeah i i guess we've we've kind of covered it	2653	A
great nice little conversation with you Jack good- good day thank you good- same to you	2653	A
why don't you start first and i'll think about it	2637	B
um-hum	2637	B
yeah um-hum	2637	B
um-hum	2637	B
yeah um-hum	2637	B
i would say our dinners are probably more casual than that with um having kids and that kind of stuff it may be inviting you know neighbors over for dinner or something like that but not really we haven't really tried a dinner party i guess	2637	B
yeah or a barbecue or something like that yeah	2637	B
um-hum	2637	B
right yeah	2637	B
yeah	2637	B
keeps the kids busy too gives the grown-ups a chance to well like you said play a game or just talk or something like that	2637	B
yeah	2637	B
that's true yeah	2637	B
well i guess we i- we lived in Kansas City for awhile and it was kind of fun to do Mexican food up there because a lot of people didn't really	2637	B
hadn't had it before and i know um we were going to make um fajitas one time and the grocery stores i mean the people knew when i asked for the beef skirt that you use to make it they said are you from Texas so it's fun	2637	B
yeah well it you can either use we've always used um beef skirt steak but you can also use flank steak and you marinate it	2637	B
the recipe i've used is you marinate it in a can of beer and a bottle of Italian dressing and then you can either grill- uh-huh	2637	B
and then you can either grill it or you can um	2637	B
broil it we usually grill it outside and then you cut it into real small real thin pieces and serve it on flour tortillas with like grated cheese and sour cream and guacamole and that type of thing	2637	B
um-hum	2637	B
i think i was reading- looking at this recipe we're going to have some guests in in a couple of weeks and they said- recommend a pound for four people i think three to four people yeah	2637	B
it it's kind of a thin steak	2637	B
and so it doesn't take very long to to grill	2637	B
yeah	2637	B
yeah um-hum	2637	B
well you just um well i usually just put it like in a Pyrex pan you know i have an eight by or a nine by thirteen pan i put it in there and i pour it over the top and then you just you know turn it leave it in there for overnight or something and turn it every once in awhile	2637	B
maybe i usually cover it with Saran wrap or something and then or start it in the morning and it's ready in the evening to cook	2637	B
um-hum	2637	B
oh yeah	2637	B
the whole yeah	2637	B
yeah	2637	B
that would make it nice and easy	2637	B
and some people like sour cream and then you like warm your um flour tortillas up in the oven	2637	B
i usually just wrap them_1 up in foil or something like that and stick them_1 in the oven for awhile	2637	B
in fact as a wedding gift we got a tortilla warmer but i don't think very many people have those and it doesn't hold very many tortillas so we don't use that often	2637	B
probably yeah	2637	B
because_1 once you get the meat in there it gets pretty filling	2637	B
oh you can yeah i i'm not into the hot hot food my my husband is but i'm not so	2637	B
um-hum	2637	B
the hottest yeah	2637	B
oh well good well it's nice talking to you where do you live in Indiana i have some relatives that live up um near Terre Haute oh okay	2637	B
yeah well i know when we flew up there we flew into Indianapolis and then had to drive down there so yeah	2637	B
yeah	2637	B
well thank you you too bye	2637	B
do you have a recipe that you would like to share	2637	A
okay uh we i find that the nicest party for dinner uh uh group for a dinner party is eight people uh they set at my dining room table easily	2637	A
and it just seems like you can decorate a table and and you can serve easily with eight people uh particularly if you're wanting to do the soup to nuts thing which uh with my	2637	A
dishes i have a really pretty soup tureen so i like to start out with you know some kind of soup that nobody's had lately like sauerkraut soup or minestrone depending upon what the menu theme is	2637	A
but one thing that i like to do um	2637	A
of course i always want to make it easy on the cook and uh the lady who is the manager of the country club gave me a really good recipe for ham loaf that it's something you can make up ahead and then stick in the oven you know	2637	A
after- after your guests are here and you've started cocktails really	2637	A
uh usually- course you have to have some kind of entertainment too and and we do play bridge my husband plays when i make him and uh	2637	A
well- usually our friends the women are the bridge players and the men are there because it's an excuse to get together	2637	A
but i do find that in- in order to have your party last beyond	2637	A
the dinner table there have- there does have to be something to go on to or you just kind of sit around and everybody goes to sleep and gets bored you know there's got to be a a silly game or a	2637	A
something fun to do afterwards	2637	A
um-hum	2637	A
you have more summer than we do though	2637	A
yeah we can do that well starting the end of this well starting now we can do that through October	2637	A
but that's about it for us and then we're basically inside you know even if it's really warm during the day at night it's going to cool off and by the time you would get ready to eat you're going to want to be in	2637	A
so our climate is not as conducive to the outdoor entertaining as yours are although it's certainly a lot more casual and a lot more fun	2637	A
yeah	2637	A
right i	2637	A
yeah and i think outside you can just kind of kick back and and visit after dinner but is seems like when you're inside the first thing you know someone has turned on a TV and that kind of is the end of your party i think	2637	A
what do you do uh for a barbecue when you cook out what's your favorite thing	2637	A
yeah	2637	A
oh i see you're- you're even labeled by your food how do you do fajitas	2637	A
eight ounce	2637	A
um-hum	2637	A
i've i've i love Mexican and i'm always doing the hot things and i make my own salsa and all that and it's really spicy but i just haven't had the nerve to try fajitas how large a steak would you need to serve eight people	2637	A
so i'd need two pounds wouldn't i one pound four people	2637	A
and then is that a fairly thick steak or	2637	A
oh	2637	A
uh-huh so when you when you get it you don't have your meat man cut it to a certain width you just take whatever you find okay flank or skirt	2637	A
okay okay_1 i'm i've been wanting to try that and i just haven't got the nerve up i do tacos and enchiladas and all that stuff but	2637	A
okay_1 a can- a sixteen ounce can of beer and then you mix eight ounces of Italian dressing with it do you let the beer get flat or	2637	A
um	2637	A
um-hum	2637	A
um-hum	2637	A
you know something i do when i marinate steak that you might think is interesting i have a tupperware uh sealed or any plastic sealed and then i just turn it over every once in awhile	2637	A
and it saves you know it's just easy just to turn the whole dish over the whole container over	2637	A
okay yeah so you do grated cheese and guacamole	2637	A
okay	2637	A
uh-huh okay	2637	A
where did i write the part about the tortillas warm the tortillas	2637	A
yeah	2637	A
okay	2637	A
i see	2637	A
uh-huh i'm sure you'd probably i mean the men would eat two and the women would eat one isn't that usually how that goes	2637	A
uh-huh	2637	A
yeah what about salsa you can or you can't- or you just don't usually put salsa on it you know	2637	A
i see	2637	A
well we have our children all three live here and our two married daughters have three children between them who range from eight to three and	2637	A
every time they and they always come here for every holiday it seems and birthdays and and every time we always have to start up with something really hot and spicy as an hors d'oeuvres and it gets to be	2637	A
both our son sons-in-law are good cooks and enjoy cooking and it kind of gets to be a contest to see who can come up with the	2637	A
well we're way up the other end of the state we're uh half way between Chicago and Indianapolis on i sixty five so and Terre Haute is you know it's like three hours south	2637	A
um-hum	2637	A
yeah this is a little town of five thousand just a perfect little town for us retired people and for raising children and	2637	A
you know you can go away for a week and you come home and say what happened and they say oh nothing so it's a pretty good spot well have a nice day bye bye	2637	A
okay	2647	A
i guess i'll start um one uh big thing that the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is	2647	A
to let their let their child experience college	2647	A
in a kind of general sense i like large colleges because i went to University of Texas at Austin they have fifty thousand students there and i feel like that now if i went	2647	A
if i had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that i wouldn't have have gotten as much exposure to different people and different uh	2647	A
i don't know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
uh-huh	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
hum	2647	A
hm	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
right	2647	A
um-hum yeah	2647	A
yeah- yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be i'm sure your classes were a lot smaller um because_1 like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number	2647	A
but um i i just i don't know i'm thinking in a sense of uh	2647	A
just being exposed to more	2647	A
it just seems like in a larger college you i don't know you're exposed to so many more people from all over the world and i'm sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that they're more	2647	A
of of the different cultures there not that it not that it's better but i'm just saying that i think that big	2647	A
uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um	2647	A
they or they're considering going to Baylor they're also considering going to UT Austin but one of the big	2647	A
no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like Waco- just like i live in Waco it's a large city i can still function in my own kind of	2647	A
area in my own group i have a job i have my friends and i'm really not as as concerned about the entire city so when you go to a big	2647	A
a big university you're not as concerned about the entire university but your group of friends your classes your interests your clubs and things like that	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum right	2647	A
right	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum um-hum	2647	A
right	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
uh-huh	2647	A
on paper um-hum exactly that's that's one important thing that i think about school i'm i'm not a kind a person that i didn't i i was kind of a B student i guess you'd say and i didn't really	2647	A
i was i strived- strived to be an A student but it wasn't like a real priority to my my priority was just	2647	A
being as worldly as i could possibly be getting into as many organizations as i could- possibly could and and one other point i was going to make was that i can understand- i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have	2647	A
more friends	2647	A
because you like you said you know	2647	A
you know everybody knows everybody and so you probably come out of it knowing and by friends i mean like contacts for when you get out of school	2647	A
um you know you just you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with more so at a small college then a large college you may have gone to school with them but you wouldn't you wouldn't know them_1 uh	2647	A
i guess let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college	2647	A
uh	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
wow	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
right	2647	A
wow	2647	A
that's great	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
right right	2647	A
that's great that's great yeah that's what i that's basically what i and when i first i've been out of college only two years now so it's still pretty fresh on my memory um	2647	A
but now that i'm out when i went into school my parents told	2647	A
well my father- okay let me let me go back to my my sister now is is in college and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that	2647	A
would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera and so forth and and i kept pushing her towards	2647	A
just kind of U UT or a larger school	2647	A
and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics and i wanted her to get	2647	A
the life experience out of it and so it was you know she went the academic way because she's a straight A student which is yeah- yeah yeah so she you know that's probably	2647	A
you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and	2647	A
right	2647	A
right	2647	A
and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be	2647	A
or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
right	2647	A
hum	2647	A
right um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
right well that was pretty courageous	2647	A
yeah	2647	A
oh yeah yeah i i'm	2647	A
i'm dealing with the loans right now so so oh yes very every every month that memory just shoots back in my mailbox	2647	A
so oh well i guess i'll get over it but oh yeah yeah okay	2647	A
uh-huh	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
um-hum	2647	A
right because when you when you do want when you do finally graduate	2647	A
that that's what you need the most i'm finding out now that what i'm needing the most now is not smarts not what i can do on paper it's stamina courage uh	2647	A
words it	2647	A
yes i'm needing you know myself- i'm needing to rely on myself and i think i learned a lot of that in school too	2647	A
that's interesting i went to a smaller school of probably three thousand thirty five hundred and i i- i thought that was the best experience in that	2647	B
we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and	2647	B
and backgrounds and so forth so i thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number um	2647	B
one of fifty thousand i was one of three thousand and and you know different perspectives i uh but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of sort of thing	2647	B
yeah	2647	B
uh-huh yeah	2647	B
that's one thing to definitely consider	2647	B
uh-huh	2647	B
yeah	2647	B
i think that's probably key to me is not so much the size of the school but what what are the particular needs of	2647	B
the students and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this um larger university setting some of the students um when i was when i was teaching school	2647	B
would not have been comfortable with that they needed uh at- at least at first	2647	B
they needed a smaller setting that that was more like family where they could get one-on-one from from teachers professors and so forth and then after a year or two move on to	2647	B
a little bit bigger pond where where when they had a little more self-confidence built up oh yes i can do this oh i've done this before it's just in a bigger setting and so maybe to me	2647	B
the key would be what- what are what are the child's- the the student's needs and what what school or schools can best meet those those needs besides education you- you- you can expect	2647	B
all of them with uh uh accreditation- accreditation to give the education	2647	B
but it's these other things that you and i are are keying off on that that are really more of an education that but they're the things that don't show up in	2647	B
that's right that's right	2647	B
right	2647	B
um	2647	B
yeah	2647	B
um-hum	2647	B
yeah	2647	B
i guess i guess now i've been out for i i'm i'm older than you i've been out for twenty one years and i was looking at an annual last night uh something had sparked- it sparked a question and i went to a	2647	B
and i realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here and i've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years	2647	B
where i go to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i and it it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same	2647	B
memories if not the same	2647	B
education- education in uh you know we- we weren't all out to be teachers or or whatever so we didn't have the same classes but we had a common thread something that still ties us together twenty odd years later	2647	B
and it's it's it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things	2647	B
those are what i carry beyond just that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at TI	2647	B
i have something more important to me than that	2647	B
uh-huh	2647	B
uh-huh	2647	B
uh-huh	2647	B
uh-huh	2647	B
i was going to ask who won	2647	B
in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her	2647	B
yeah	2647	B
i think it helps uh uh now my grandfather was going to pay if i went to uh what's now UT Arlington because it was there in my hometown i could live at home but i chose to go to another school	2647	B
and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money and- and i think i value my my education more because i had to work for it	2647	B
and because i knew all along that's what i wanted even- even though i had to buck the family in order to to do what i needed to do	2647	B
so um i- i guess i guess it was it was my mother's support that got me through it that and ten years of of uh loans after i got out	2647	B
sounds familiar huh your it's very fresh in your memory	2647	B
well-	2647	B
uh yeah	2647	B
yes well sorry about that Tanya	2647	B
i'm sure it was worth it though	2647	B
if if nothing else because_1 i work in training at TI now if nothing else just	2647	B
those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve whatever you set your mind on	2647	B
and the you you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted	2647	B
young lady you have gotten your education then that's that's right	2647	B
