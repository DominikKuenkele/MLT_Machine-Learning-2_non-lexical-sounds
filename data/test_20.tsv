well i they go from everywhere to just like halfway up the knee to uh mid calf	3701	B
not halfway not halfway up my leg halfway up my knee	3701	B
okay my half of my knee might	3701	B
uh and my	3701	B
really	3701	B
you mean you have fat days and thin days	3701	B
well right now i'm having a fat month i know half of my clothes don't fit me since the holiday season	3701	B
well we have to get all of this junk food out of the house from Christmas	3701	B
well	3701	B
yeah	3750	B
oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time	3750	B
except for what i call living now which is which is very close to camping yeah you know i i camped in the Boy Scouts and uh	3750	B
you know my dad and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because_1 i was in construction	3750	B
and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it	3750	B
and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous	3750	B
so my buddy and i we just camped and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it	3750	B
course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's a couple of years older than me and uh	3750	B
he graduated and went off to college and and during- during summer we'd camp out at the lake	3750	B
and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in the morning go skiing	3750	B
you know in in the afternoon you know it's still four o'clock you got four hours of day light good skiing left	3750	B
and uh it was great	3750	B
but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really	3750	B
oh yeah well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago we didn't have a phone	3750	B
and they didn't have phone lines i mean there was you just couldn't get a phone	3750	B
and uh we're on the we're third from the end on the electric string	3750	B
so uh and we're at the end of the mail route like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas	3750	B
but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home	3750	B
one of these twelve by forty eight's that got repaid	3750	B
and uh i swapped them_1 a Cadillac for it and uh put it out here on the land figuring i'd build a house some day you know i'm in construction and uh	3750	B
you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know	3750	B
and uh i came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was packed everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving	3750	B
and i said where she said out to the trailer and i said oh no she said yep i said okay	3750	B
so we've been uh roughing it out here about three years but it's not bad i we got color TV and microwave i mean you know it's not horrible but it's it's a lot like camping	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
sure	3750	B
became civilized	3750	B
yep my mom goes camping you know she she takes her uh motor home	3750	B
and but you know she has a lot of fun	3750	B
and mostly it's just a way to she she goes to dog shows see she shows dogs and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel	3750	B
and so she you know takes the motor home	3750	B
and she made a deal with my dad that she'd take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing and she but if he'd buy her a motor home so he did	3750	B
but as far as as camping my wife and i had plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the you know Highway One there in in California	3750	B
uh as soon as we get this house finished i'm gonna need a vacation	3750	B
okay so you enjoy camping	3750	A

uh-huh	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
uh-huh	3750	A
yeah well i grew up in California in southern uh central California right in the valley so it's forty five minute drive to the mountains and	3750	A
um so my dad loved fishing and camping so we'd go up first we went up just uh with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot dogs by the fire or whatever	3750	A
but then later my mom and dad got a camper so uh we've kind of moved up yeah a little bit in the world	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
no	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah oh that's a that'll be pretty that's really pretty out there	3750	A
so a lot of nice places	3750	A
Mark i was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time	3737	A
really have you had lessons guitar lessons	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band	3737	A
well and bad hours too	3737	A
huh well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i don't play very well but uh i wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as um	3737	A
i usually	3737	A
you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's Christmas time or a birthday or uh we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some	3737	A
um crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
that's true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
hum	3737	A
sounds like it	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
that's awful	3737	A
that's pretty funny well i uh since my kids started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a Pilgrim feast and things and so i've done some	3737	A
right so i've done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um	3737	A
it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at school and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest and read	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
hum	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
well and there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing	3737	A
hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um	3737	A
you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need	3737	A
uh-huh i like that	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
and it's	3737	A
right and it's functional so that you're always needing you know it's nice to do your Christmas cards	3737	A
yeah sounds good	3737	A
yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like um we've done a lot	3737	A
too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the garage a lot	3737	B
uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they weren't very good	3737	B
and uh so i didn't really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there	3737	B
yeah i was i was in several bands when i was	3737	B
some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because_1 they were all a little pig headed and	3737	B
self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves	3737	B
yeah yeah that too	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store	3737	B
so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself	3737	B
um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh	3737	B
if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that	3737	B
but uh	3737	B
it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything	3737	B
my my dad's gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh	3737	B
he didn't get it finished because_1 he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh	3737	B
he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over	3737	B
it's like Dad you're doing it wrong	3737	B
you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
and Halloween and	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah i i work- i work out of the i work at a Renaissance festival down in Waxahachie and uh	3737	B
i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh	3737	B
it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and	3737	B
kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it	3737	B
yeah like my mom sew has sewn for years and years and years and years and years	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah yeah	3737	B
one one one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy	3737	B
i i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and	3737	B
yeah you can do it yourself- do your Christmas cards and invitations and things like that	3737	B
or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall	3737	B
uh i i live in Richardson just outside of Dallas it snowed- snowed just-	3737	B
