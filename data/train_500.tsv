um-hum	3763	B
uh baseball	3763	B
well i've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers	3763	B
uh	3763	B
more so with uh	3763	B
uh their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that that closely	3763	B
but uh since- you know since i live here so close to Arlington uh	3763	B
that's the team that i've been kind of following	3763	B
um-hum	3763	B
right	3763	B
well i think that uh	3763	B
you know with uh	3763	B
so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um	3763	B
you know i think	3763	B
i'm not real sure about that- do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's uh	3763	B
yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit	3763	B
yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five million- that's a lot of money	3763	B
yeah they are	3763	B
um-hum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to	3763	B
i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh	3763	B
uh pay him what his salary's going to be	3763	B
uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent	3763	B
and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway	3763	B
but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the six- you know the six million dollars a year this year	3763	B
uh-huh	3763	B
oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him	3763	B
yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh	3763	B
Pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the Rangers are concerned i think	3763	B
i think they need some definitely need some pitching	3763	B
uh	3763	B
and so i you know i	3763	B
um the pitching coach	3763	B
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was going- was helping out uh	3763	B
his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh	3763	B
oh you don't like Howse huh	3763	B
oh Tom Grieve	3763	B
yeah i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet	3763	B
but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they	3763	B
that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and	3763	B
um	3763	B
you do huh	3763	B
that's contrary to uh popular belief you know	3763	B
oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know	3763	B
they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and	3763	B
and uh	3763	B
yeah	3763	B
are you there okay now tell me your favorite team	3763	A
yes	3763	A
okay i think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed	3763	A
so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers	3763	A
what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do	3763	A
well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his	3763	A
yes and the Rangers go up a little bit um-hum	3763	A
i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest	3763	A
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous	3763	A
no	3763	A
that's right	3763	A
what i saw on the news today that Buechele- Buechele was back just to visit	3763	A
i'm awful sorry he's not still	3763	A
oh i'm sure it was	3763	A
Pittsburgh yeah	3763	A
yes sir	3763	A
well what do you think of Howse	3763	A
who is the coach for the pitchers	3763	A
yes	3763	A
his assistant	3763	A
um-hum	3763	A
i really wish they could	3763	A
see fit to get rid of Howse	3763	A
no no i really don't	3763	A
and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of Howse and i'm not fond of Grieves	3763	A
yeah	3763	A
well i'm just gullible enough that i think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right	3763	A
and i'm sure well	3763	A
oh i know i know so but i would like so much	3763	A
for these Rangers to get their act together and give um	3763	A
oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs	3763	A
i understand	3763	A
well	3763	A
i just oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and let's us have-	3763	A
do work in a large organization now	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh	3724	A
oh yeah that's pretty big	3724	A
i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees	3724	A
i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um	3724	A
besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss	3724	A
yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one	3724	A
right everyone's so integral	3724	A
um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too	3724	A
well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know- in a larger	3724	A
really in health care uh-huh	3724	A
uh-huh vacation and	3724	A
and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits	3724	A
uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without	3724	A
um-hum um-hum	3724	A
right that really gets prohibitive	3724	A
yes i've heard that too	3724	A
it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um	3724	A
my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't	3724	A
he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the security of an organization's benefits	3724	A
it- it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand	3724	A
um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it	3724	A
the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical	3724	A
yeah	3724	A
you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh	3724	A
a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer	3724	A
so as as of this date my husband and my kids are free because_1 they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if	3724	A
exactly	3724	A
um well i- i work in a actually it's sort of an odd situation right now but uh	3724	B
i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization	3724	B
and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago	3724	B
but it's it's not really a large organization but uh nearly- nearly five hundred people	3724	B
yeah how about_1 yourself are you	3724	B
that's	3724	B
uh-huh	3724	B
hum	3724	B
yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh	3724	B
ooh yeah i i think it it's probably- the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah-	3724	B
yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's	3724	B
it's generally important	3724	B
but	3724	B
um um-hum	3724	B
what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things	3724	B
yeah	3724	B
yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent	3724	B
yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean- it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses	3724	B
and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations	3724	B
also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization	3724	B
and uh	3724	B
i you- you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them_1 i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um	3724	B
um typically let's see uh typically the myself i- i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in to- for them to be covered but it was pretty economical	3724	B
um especially relative to just buying your own health care package	3724	B
yeah and so you know- so that's that's handy uh you know i think that it- i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead	3724	B
uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary	3724	B
and which is which is pretty amazing	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
right are	3724	B
oh well um-hum yeah that's good- i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think	3724	B
um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking	3724	B
um-hum	3724	B
oh uh-huh copayment uh uh-huh	3724	B
right	3724	B
yeah i- i mean i	3724	B
typically- you- typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um	3724	B
you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping	3724	B
well how do you feel about um putting an elderly family family member in a nursing home	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah oh i agree i it's it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel um	3702	A
i- i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families	3702	A
and yet i understand um well we may be facing that with my grandmother she lives- is living near my parents out in California	3702	A
and they this year they moved her into a um retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care	3702	A
but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and	3702	A
it's it's difficult because i know my mother feels really um torn about it she doesn't want to	3702	A
to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the the place is like um	3702	A
i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and	3702	A
um and yet it's a real burden to her to have to to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
yeah i uh i was thinking you know it might	3702	A
i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there	3702	A
um because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's it's been negative where the	3702	A
and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time	3702	A
then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've i've been to other places where you know the people have told me um this is a really good place the people here really care about us so	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
yeah well no um but all the years that i've been alive she has um for the last thirty years or so	3702	A
it's Central California	3702	A
yeah	3702	A
uh-huh	3702	A
yeah well this is Fresno uh-huh	3702	A
um-hum	3702	A
i'm not too happy about the idea although	3702	B
i do realize that sometimes it becomes necessary to do that or to have round the clock kind of health- care available in the house	3702	B
which often is is not that um easy to to do sometimes it really is easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be given	3702	B
i'm very happy that in my life so far i have not had to do that kind of a thing um	3702	B
my own mother lived with us for some years and uh just died peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life and uh i never had to face that personally	3702	B
and uh what do you think you might do in such a situation	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
oh	3702	B
oh yes	3702	B
i see	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
uh-huh	3702	B
that's right um-hum	3702	B
yeah people are just not as home as much as they used to be um sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet and	3702	B
um and therefore uh they have to leave the older person all the by themselves or with the care of somebody else and some of the diseases that uh older people have uh do require more intensive surveillance	3702	B
so uh it it isn't easy i suppose one of the	3702	B
uh best things if you are considering a nursing home is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations i know i always trust the opinion of a	3702	B
close friend uh above just what i might read about a place if somebody i knew and cared about liked a place and said no this was good and	3702	B
we were happy about the personnel and the care et cetera and so forth i would it certainly would go up in my estimation	3702	B
and uh sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best uh place is um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
yeah	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
um-hum	3702	B
well there's hope i guess uh has uh your grandmother always lived in California	3702	B
oh	3702	B
i see yeah	3702	B
yeah what part of California is that	3702	B
oh i see we used to live out there in the San Jose area so uh you know i'm kind of familiar with the state of California and like it very much yeah	3702	B
but um uh it's uh it's a difficult situation uh sometimes also when you get involved in the	3702	B
in those residences for the elderly the retirement homes and and also uh maybe even the nursing division of a residence home	3702	B
um it's tremendously expensive and sometimes they ask you to uh	3702	B
um well where are some of the places you've been	3794	B
um-hum	3794	B
well i've been a lot of different places uh	3794	B
Hawaii Japan Europe	3794	B
and and-	3794	B
most of the fifty	3794	B
i haven't been to Alaska yet	3794	B
yeah i thought we might go up on the uh inland ferry that goes up there from uh from British-	3794	B
right	3794	B
yes	3794	B
oh yeah it's a long desolate stretch but well desolate in that it's all uh the same scenery after a while just like driving in the desert you know after a while it all looks the same	3794	B
huh	3794	B
no no	3794	B
well actually Hawaii is getting cheap too because uh	3794	B
with the economic uh	3794	B
situation- uh situation we're in they've lowered the prices uh quite a bit	3794	B
where do you stay when you go to Virginia on the beach	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
uh-huh	3794	B
yeah i bet	3794	B
well if he's a landscape architect he ought to like Washington DC in the daylight hours	3794	B
your dad's in the military	3794	B
retired- retired	3794	B
well being from uh living in Texas you probably like cool weather on your uh vacations at least we do	3794	B
uh	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
well usually vacation time July August September it's time to go somewhere else	3794	B
oh yeah	3794	B
um	3794	B
yeah	3794	B
no no i haven't	3794	B
yeah i saw the Sixty- Sixty Minutes also last year we went to uh the Oregon coast and- and that is really beautiful	3794	B
and it's also unlike California completely because it's cool enough that you don't have uh the surfers much because they need protective clothing you know	3794	B
and- and uh there's really uh several nice places to stay along the coast there	3794	B
we stayed at what was called the uh kite capital of the world what was the name of that city- place	3794	B
Lincoln City	3794	B
and it is really nice uh we a very nice place on the beach and very reasonably priced compared to California particularly	3794	B
so- in fact most of the	3794	B
that's right most of the Californians that uh want to stay on the coast apparently the families and so forth they come up to Oregon and Washington coast to stay because it's much uh more economical	3794	B
yeah we've we've been up that way and well this that trip we also went to uh Vancouver and out to uh Victoria which is very nice	3794	B
well you got you haven't been to California either then	3794	B
well if you go to California don't go to Los Angeles unless you really want to just see the movie stars set up and so forth	3794	B
but uh San Diego and San Francisco are both very nice right	3794	B
i don't know about you but i haven't had any trouble having any fun on vacation	3794	A
i can't think of any place i wouldn't want to go to take one	3794	A
oh i know a real good place is Virginia	3794	A
it's real nice	3794	A
it has mountains beach whatever you want	3794	A
have you been in any great places lately	3794	A
oh now i haven't been there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
you plan on going	3794	A
oh yeah now i'd like to go uh to Canada on the boat	3794	A
my parents went not long ago	3794	A
or to Key West have you ever been to Key West	3794	A
is it pretty	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
oh no	3794	A
no i've never been huh is it very expensive	3794	A
not compared to Hawaii huh	3794	A
really	3794	A
well that's nice to know	3794	A
well that's good	3794	A
um yeah i've been to Virginia Beach and i've been up to the uh homestead in hot springs in the mountains it's real nice	3794	A
and uh oh let's see i've been to Charlottesville through Monticello uh my husband's a a landscape architect and he uh he really liked that and to see Thomas Jefferson's home	3794	A
yeah now we we went there went there to stay at the Army Navy club with my dad and that was real nice that was real nice	3794	A
uh no he used to be he he's a retired attorney now uh but he was the uh he was uh uh	3794	A
in the reserves for quite a long time and uh he's active in something right now i forgot what it is	3794	A
but um i he's somehow connected still with it	3794	A
yeah sometimes- sometimes you know when it in when it's getting really hot in Texas you know you want to go someplace cool	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
have you ever been to Arkansas	3794	A
now i've i've been but not to way up at near Branson oh i hear it's just booming up there now	3794	A
up around Silver- Silver- Silver Dollar City have you been there	3794	A
i heard on uh what was it Sixty Minutes or something a lot of the country western um people are starting to build their nightclubs up there	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
oh really	3794	A
really	3794	A
how about population is it very uh crowded	3794	A
hum	3794	A
oh	3794	A
oh i bet	3794	A
really i bet but- but it's not as crowded either	3794	A
huh	3794	A
yeah i'd like to go up around Washington sometime to see	3794	A
yeah	3794	A
well i think the furthest west i've ever gotten is the Grand Canyon	3794	A
no huh-uh no	3794	A
oh i won't	3794	A
no no no	3794	A
really	3794	A
i know my grandparents have been to San Francisco years ago and they said it was real nice-	3794	A
well i could do with a lot less than that	3782	B
i live in Dallas	3782	B
oh good well i live in Plano in that case	3782	B
oh yeah i do yeah	3782	B
yes	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
i know	3782	B
and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i don't know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and that's how it started with uh four percent five percent	3782	B
and all of a sudden here we are now	3782	B
and it's horrible	3782	B
well	3782	B
it's true but they did without it all those years	3782	B
and they keep talking about the state tax and they'll probably put one in and they'll have this too so	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
well i hope it doesn't but you know how it goes so	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
raise them	3782	B
oh	3782	B
oh well it will	3782	B
probably the first season	3782	B
but they're funny about things like that here	3782	B
they really are when i came here you couldn't buy beer couldn't buy a drink nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know	3782	B
so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
oh that is	3782	B
oh	3782	B
hm	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
that is	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
hm	3782	B
oh yeah that is	3782	B
uh uh they well they do a little bit but um	3782	B
it's it's like next to nothing i've seen it it's on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
it costs what	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
uh-huh	3782	B
really	3782	B
God	3782	B
yeah so you haven't been here very long	3782	B
you haven't been here very long	3782	B
two years	3782	B
um-hum	3782	B
uh yeah	3782	B
yeah	3782	B
no i don't i'm a nurse i work down at Presbyterian	3782	B
yeah oh it is you know they're supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least that's what i heard that you could- could get to do ten calls	3782	B
and this is like the seventeenth	3782	B
yeah so it's great	3782	B
so what do you think about the uh income taxes	3782	A
where do you live	3782	A
okay i live in Dallas too	3782	A
okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i-	3782	A
yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax	3782	A
it i think it's like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there	3782	A
Washington DC was only six percent	3782	A
and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half	3782	A
it was only four percent	3782	A
really	3782	A
um-hum um-hum	3782	A
what	3782	A
since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because_1 Virginia does have a state tax	3782	A
um-hum hm	3782	A
yeah it	3782	A
if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset	3782	A
because_1 i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck	3782	A
uh every two weeks and uh if that comes back in	3782	A
i'll be pretty mad because_1 sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know	3782	A
so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax	3782	A
yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes	3782	A
and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing	3782	A
they're putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because_1 of that yeah they said uh to build okay	3782	A
apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds	3782	A
and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds	3782	A
well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes	3782	A
but it seems like it would pay itself off	3782	A
so you know what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know	3782	A
yeah so you know	3782	A
yeah things like that you know	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
no huh	3782	A
um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe	3782	A
but uh like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties	3782	A
and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh	3782	A
on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up	3782	A
you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year	3782	A
and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year	3782	A
but that gets real expensive	3782	A
do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know	3782	A
um	3782	A
um-hum	3782	A
well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks	3782	A
so it's only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your property- personal property tax	3782	A
for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess	3782	A
that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out	3782	A
what's that	3782	A
i've been here about two years now	3782	A
but uh in the two years i've i've been here i've been through i've had two cars	3782	A
so i've never really like you know	3782	A
i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax	3782	A
on the car other than what i paid when i registered- uh registered the car	3782	A
so that's the only thing i can really think of	3782	A
so so do you work for TI or you just doing this	3782	A
okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool	3782	A
oh do they really	3782	A
yeah i- i don't know how the thing works uh	3782	A
oh really all right you	3782	A
yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be	3759	B
i haven't had any real uh recent problems with that i've been a little bit leery i have mail ordered uh a uh video camera from New York	3759	B
and i was worried that that might uh cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
just can you hold on just one sec	3759	B
i got a six year old that's going out of off of his mind he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
do you buy um do you buy much mail order	3759	B
do you buy much mail order	3759	B
uh-huh have you had any problems with that at all	3759	B
oh uh-huh	3759	B
oh yeah	3759	B
well some some places are good about sending them_1 out by UPS or or other ways but	3759	B
i think most of the time i uh maybe it's just the kind of shopper i am i will uh decide on the kind of thing i want and	3759	B
try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and and generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but	3759	B
uh maybe it's the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i'm saying	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh well at least they're	3759	B
trying to uh give you some kind of concession there	3759	B
i'm trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back	3759	B
i bought some clothing i don't know if you get these Lands' End catalogs	3759	B
they uh make mail order clothing and most of it's very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years	3759	B
and um they've been very good with the exception of one that had the uh button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it	3759	B
and uh	3759	B
no they're real good in fact i've had the shirt for uh actually i probably had it for over a year	3759	B
and the only reason i called them_1 on it is because i'd had similar shirts that held up for several years	3759	B
and uh they said uh regardless that you've you know worn it for a year or over a year we'll uh take it back and give you a new one	3759	B
huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
right	3759	B
well i think that's uh that's really just good business you know	3759	B
if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do you've got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back	3759	B
you know that's like i've seen on this mail order if they were uh skin flints about it and wouldn't take it back	3759	B
i mean they they uh depend on that kind of a reputation so much	3759	B
you know	3759	B
oh yeah this they're sporting aren't they uh-huh	3759	B
yeah	3759	B
uh-huh you said you'd bought uh cars recently what kind of cars have you {boughten}	3759	B
oh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
uh-huh you haven't had any problems with it though huh	3759	B
uh-huh	3759	B
what's your feeling about American versus foreign and	3759	B
did you hear the topic Carol	3759	A
right	3759	A
oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been	3759	A
you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted	3759	A
you know for a good part	3759	A
yes	3759	A
oh	3759	A
i think i think the only problem i've had in the last two or three years is i was- i was in Germany a couple of years ago and	3759	A
bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didn't receive everything but you know that's you sort of take that chance you buy something like that	3759	A
pardon me	3759	A
oh a little bit	3759	A
no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands	3759	A
i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item	3759	A
you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and	3759	A
two days after i bought them i picked them_1 up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh	3759	A
get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over	3759	A
he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference	3759	A
which i thought was fair	3759	A
sure	3759	A
but overall i think i'm uh	3759	A
no	3759	A
right	3759	A
any trouble getting it back	3759	A
sure	3759	A
i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they don't have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything	3759	A
so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
you bet	3759	A
oh absolutely	3759	A
yeah mail- mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk	3759	A
right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if you're dissatisfied with it in anyway and they're very easy get along- get along with and they don't mind taking something back	3759	A
i bought a Lincoln	3759	A
and uh	3759	A
up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit	3759	A
it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now	3759	A
no not really you know it's like the old uh saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true	3759	A
but they don't build them like they used to but	3759	A
uh just about_1 um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last ten or twenty years	3704	B
and um i guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field	3704	B
that uh of course when i was growing up not very many women went to work at all most everyone was at home	3704	B
and some of my friends whose mothers were teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their mothers weren't at home	3704	B
yes and uh but nowadays it's just so common	3704	B
a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that i've had children i've stopped uh working	3704	B
that it's kind of embarrassing when i go to a store and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work number please and then i don't have a work number to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
yes	3704	B
that's true	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right	3704	B
right	3704	B
no and it wasn't like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it's it's pennies but for them it's just a socialized behavior	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
that's true that's probably true	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
right me too	3704	B
well that's good in in in our homes we all have a lot- uh much more high tech compared to the people ten twenty years ago	3704	B
right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and	3704	B
um-hum	3704	B
uh-huh	3704	B
right we	3704	B
load up on all of the conveniences and they're not special to us anymore just a	3704	B
necessity and there's the people who don't have televisions are	3704	B
are uh you know unusual in our society	3704	B
um-hum um-hum	3704	B
what was the topic	3704	A
i said uh	3704	A
right- right	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah	3704	A
yeah really	3704	A
uh oh	3704	A
there there was a stigma attached to it	3704	A
and- and a necessity	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
uh-huh	3704	A
yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i- i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work	3704	A
yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i- i thought well	3704	A
you know in a lot of different ways i- i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much it's changed i mean uh	3704	A
uh i live in Houston but i'm i'm in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami it's i mean honestly English is almost a second language now	3704	A
uh you know with all the uh influx of uh South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh	3704	A
i- i guess a majority in Miami you know of- course in Houston uh you've got the people from Mexico so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh	3704	A
the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh	3704	A
you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and- and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country	3704	A
plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh	3704	A
you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted	3704	A
uh you know thirty years ago uh a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event	3704	A
and- and- and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i i'm not sure of that	3704	A
oh yeah	3704	A
that's right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event	3704	A
and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month they'd have a stroke	3704	A
yeah	3704	A
oh well- and you know microwaves	3704	A
oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have three televisions you know and i really they're two well	3704	A
one of them_1 is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in six months i mean it's there you know	3704	A
and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones	3704	A
um	3704	A
that's right that's right	3704	A
yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh	3704	A
issue i've run across a few people before that- that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know people look at them_1 yeah like yeah you know but-	3704	A
and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not	3704	A
okay Carolyn what kind of dress do you have to wear when you go to work	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
uh well in my company we do have to dress up and they don't say that you have to um dress in a dress for women but they strongly urge it	3701	A
so it's it's kind of an unwritten law	3701	A
right	3701	A
exactly it's puts puts forth a better image it's uh my company doesn't usually have casual days we had our first one in four at least since i've been there which is four years not too long ago and	3701	A
i didn't feel comfortable dressing like many people came in like warm ups and no and i	3701	A
yeah and i don't feel i- i wore you know a nice pair of pants and and blouse but i- i- i just couldn't feel comfortable in my warm ups around everybody at work	3701	A
oh well it was just recently so i don't know if they'll do it again the way some people looked i would doubt it	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
i don't know i it just seems if you want to get ahead or even if you just want everybody to think of you you know as a a professionally you you don't just want to have the real casual look all the time	3701	A
well we've got two hundred people in our office but we're the corporate office so um it's it's relatively large but i mean i have a job very much longer so i- i don't want to say too much	3701	A
exactly we have to hold the image for everybody	3701	A
i would like to you know i dress as nicely as my budget allows	3701	A
and and you know i mean it's it's a lot better than some people there and it's not as nice because i don't have the money of others you know what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
so you don't work with many women	3701	A
and i work with all women	3701	A
and my husband does well not all but the majority and my husband he works in a bank and he works with all women	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
at least at the lower levels you know	3701	A
okay	3701	A
what about season to season do you change	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
um-hum	3701	A
exactly i- i do the same and that's what basically keeps my wardrobe i may wear a few really warm dresses in the winter but i don't i don't change a whole lot because it's it's we're environmentally controlled you know	3701	A
you end up wearing the same thing	3701	A
below the knee	3701	A
i- i- i don't have nice knees they're kind of knobby so	3701	A
on the knobby side i what about you	3701	A
uh-huh	3701	A
halfway up the knee	3701	A
you must have better	3701	A
oh okay-	3701	A
oh okay	3701	A
i- i- i'm thinking halfway between the knee and your say your hip	3701	A
well it that it is but i know a lot of women who who do wear those skirts and they have been reprimanded in our company before	3701	A
yeah	3701	A
also i was going to just mention that i wear what you know my my wardrobe- my wardrobe how should i say it i wear what i can fit into	3701	A
oh yeah fat months thin months you know	3701	A
exactly the same for me but i'm working on it but i'm not doing a very good job at this point	3701	A
i haven't gotten serious yet	3701	A
that's right that's right but i'm so used to eating now it's hard to get out of the habit	3701	A
uh i can actually wear anything i want to however i generally wear uh suits or dresses	3701	B
how about_1 you	3701	B
well the company that i work for uh we it's very casual we don't see any people there's a plant out in the back and then i'm in the office section	3701	B
and we always had casual day on Friday which meant you could wear jeans or whatever you wanted to which to me dressing down is you know like wearing pants and a jacket or something	3701	B
but uh	3701	B
even though i don't have to dress during the day you know in anything that dressy i still feel better i feel more professional when i'm dressed up	3701	B
you're kidding that's casual	3701	B
uh-huh	3701	B
would i assume that perhaps they did that one time and that was it	3701	B
well that's what i always thought actually uh the gals in our customer service department quite honestly came in every day in what i considered casual but	3701	B
um-hum do you work for a large company	3701	B
well and it and it affects uh you know being in the corporate office how you have to dress too do you	3701	B
do you tend to dress up toward your superiors as the books kind of	3701	B
i understand	3701	B
um-hum	3701	B
uh i have never i really have not worked for very many companies that i had a female role model	3701	B
um the we have some i'm sure in our corporate office but i've not met them yet but uh the last few jobs i've had well there was two jobs ago there was a girl in the office uh that i tended to try to emulate somewhat but uh	3701	B
no not too many	3701	B
i've	3701	B
do you really	3701	B
majority	3701	B
i'm sure that's true i used to be in banking and you're right the majority of the people there	3701	B
uh	3701	B
exactly-	3701	B
what oh someone never mind that's a call coming in but	3701	B
we'll pass that	3701	B
um i probably get a little bit more casual in summer	3701	B
in then in that i would wear a more casual top under some of my suits	3701	B
than i would wear in the winter	3701	B
but our offices are rather cold so i i'll tend to try to dress warmly too	3701	B
well tell me another thing	3701	B
uh how do you wear your skirt lengths	3701	B
well i they go from everywhere to just like halfway up the knee to uh mid calf	3701	B
not halfway not halfway up my leg halfway up my knee	3701	B
okay my half of my knee might	3701	B
uh and my	3701	B
really	3701	B
you mean you have fat days and thin days	3701	B
well right now i'm having a fat month i know half of my clothes don't fit me since the holiday season	3701	B
well we have to get all of this junk food out of the house from Christmas	3701	B
well	3701	B
yeah	3750	B
oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time	3750	B
except for what i call living now which is which is very close to camping yeah you know i i camped in the Boy Scouts and uh	3750	B
you know my dad and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because_1 i was in construction	3750	B
and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it	3750	B
and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous	3750	B
so my buddy and i we just camped and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it	3750	B
course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's a couple of years older than me and uh	3750	B
he graduated and went off to college and and during- during summer we'd camp out at the lake	3750	B
and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in the morning go skiing	3750	B
you know in in the afternoon you know it's still four o'clock you got four hours of day light good skiing left	3750	B
and uh it was great	3750	B
but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really	3750	B
oh yeah well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago we didn't have a phone	3750	B
and they didn't have phone lines i mean there was you just couldn't get a phone	3750	B
and uh we're on the we're third from the end on the electric string	3750	B
so uh and we're at the end of the mail route like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas	3750	B
but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home	3750	B
one of these twelve by forty eight's that got repaid	3750	B
and uh i swapped them_1 a Cadillac for it and uh put it out here on the land figuring i'd build a house some day you know i'm in construction and uh	3750	B
you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know	3750	B
and uh i came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was packed everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving	3750	B
and i said where she said out to the trailer and i said oh no she said yep i said okay	3750	B
so we've been uh roughing it out here about three years but it's not bad i we got color TV and microwave i mean you know it's not horrible but it's it's a lot like camping	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
uh-huh	3750	B
sure	3750	B
became civilized	3750	B
yep my mom goes camping you know she she takes her uh motor home	3750	B
and but you know she has a lot of fun	3750	B
and mostly it's just a way to she she goes to dog shows see she shows dogs and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel	3750	B
and so she you know takes the motor home	3750	B
and she made a deal with my dad that she'd take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing and she but if he'd buy her a motor home so he did	3750	B
but as far as as camping my wife and i had plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the you know Highway One there in in California	3750	B
uh as soon as we get this house finished i'm gonna need a vacation	3750	B
okay so you enjoy camping	3750	A
yeah uh-huh	3750	A
uh-huh	3750	A

um so my dad loved fishing and camping so we'd go up first we went up just uh with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot dogs by the fire or whatever	3750	A
but then later my mom and dad got a camper so uh we've kind of moved up yeah a little bit in the world	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
no	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah	3750	A
um-hum	3750	A
yeah oh that's a that'll be pretty that's really pretty out there	3750	A
so a lot of nice places	3750	A
Mark i was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time	3737	A
really have you had lessons guitar lessons	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band	3737	A
well and bad hours too	3737	A
huh well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i don't play very well but uh i wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as um	3737	A
i usually	3737	A
you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's Christmas time or a birthday or uh we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some	3737	A
um crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
that's true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
hum	3737	A
sounds like it	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
that's awful	3737	A
that's pretty funny well i uh since my kids started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a Pilgrim feast and things and so i've done some	3737	A
right so i've done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um	3737	A
it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at school and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest and read	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
hum	3737	A
uh-huh	3737	A
yeah	3737	A
well and there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing	3737	A
hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um	3737	A
you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need	3737	A
uh-huh i like that	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
and it's	3737	A
right and it's functional so that you're always needing you know it's nice to do your Christmas cards	3737	A
yeah sounds good	3737	A
yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like um we've done a lot	3737	A
too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are	3737	A
um-hum	3737	A
uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the garage a lot	3737	B
uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they weren't very good	3737	B
and uh so i didn't really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there	3737	B
yeah i was i was in several bands when i was	3737	B
some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because_1 they were all a little pig headed and	3737	B
self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves	3737	B
yeah yeah that too	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store	3737	B
so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself	3737	B
um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh	3737	B
if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that	3737	B
but uh	3737	B
it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything	3737	B
my my dad's gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh	3737	B
he didn't get it finished because_1 he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh	3737	B
he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over	3737	B
it's like Dad you're doing it wrong	3737	B
you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
and Halloween and	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah i i work- i work out of the i work at a Renaissance festival down in Waxahachie and uh	3737	B
i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh	3737	B
it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and	3737	B
kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it	3737	B
yeah like my mom sew has sewn for years and years and years and years and years	3737	B
yeah	3737	B
yeah yeah	3737	B
one one one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy	3737	B
i i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and	3737	B
yeah you can do it yourself- do your Christmas cards and invitations and things like that	3737	B
or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall	3737	B
uh i i live in Richardson just outside of Dallas it snowed- snowed just-	3737	B
are you Bob	3751	A
oh okay i am in Waco	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
right down the street	3751	A
oh credit cards my favorite subject	3751	A
oh do i uh	3751	A
yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them_1 a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off	3751	A
and so then you have no money so you use a credit card	3751	A
so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is	3751	A
do you use them a lot	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
oh	3751	A
yeah yeah well that is a good idea	3751	A
that through a Visa	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
huh	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
yeah that is my problem i don't try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know so i have got myself	3751	A
exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now	3751	A
but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them	3751	A
so it is kind of strange	3751	A
oh yeah exactly like the government in	3751	A
in debt for	3751	A
yeah yeah	3751	A
have they put the cap on the interest rates	3751	A
i didn't know if they actually did that or not i know they were i know they were considering it	3751	A
uh-huh yeah	3751	A
funny how that works isn't it	3751	A
i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety	3751	A
i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it	3751	A
because of the economy yeah	3751	A
exactly	3751	A
i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting	3751	A
yeah i have a credit union	3751	A
yeah they do uh-huh	3751	A
yes i do yes i do a matter of fact	3751	A
uh i work for Channel six	3751	A
it's it's an NBC affiliate down here	3751	A
oh really	3751	A
oh okay where do you work what is your	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
so you probably work with uh	3751	A
uh what is the boy from here	3751	A
you ever work with Davis	3751	A
Davis Iron Work yeah	3751	A
oh okay and uh what else	3751	A
yeah well i live actually in Hewett	3751	A
yeah right outside so that is where Davis Iron Works is	3751	A
uh	3751	A
i don't think i have seen that one i am sure i pass by it or something but i am not sure	3751	A
huh Prime Air	3751	A
oh okay	3751	A
okay	3751	A
have you ever been to Marlin	3751	A
i think it is Marlin or Mart they have uh	3751	A
uh a place i guess that would be similar to Prime Air it is called H G H or something like K G H or	3751	A
i can't think of i can't think of the name but	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
oh yeah	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
uh-huh	3751	A
yeah	3751	A
uh-huh oh i don't like that drive i make that drive sometimes we have stories out there but	3751	A
huh oh really i know	3751	A
oh goodness they they are bad at Hewett too on eighty four they are real bad that is where i got my last ticket	3751	A
so of course i couldn't pay that on a credit-	3751	A
i am in Plano where are you	3751	B
is that right oh okay	3751	B
you mean you use credit cards	3751	B
i bet you used them all up over Christmas	3751	B
and then your are in debt	3751	B
i understand that	3751	B
well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because_1 you get	3751	B
Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way	3751	B
so	3751	B
as long as you pay it off every month it doesn't cost you anything	3751	B
so	3751	B
that is what i	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
but uh	3751	B
i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh	3751	B
if i can get away with paying them_1 off every month it is alright if i don't then it gets expensive	3751	B
well you shouldn't do that you you- you- never- you- you- you never get out of the hole that way	3751	B
kind of like the federal government right	3751	B
never- never get out of debt	3751	B
and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right	3751	B
so	3751	B
no	3751	B
no	3751	B
just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so	3751	B
thou- thou who doesn't need credit gets cheap credit	3751	B
well i think so because the	3751	B
that's right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you	3751	B
we have a Master Card or Visa too	3751	B
you got that one	3751	B
who who do you work for	3751	B
oh	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
i do a lot of work down in Waco a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there	3751	B
yeah	3751	B
i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh	3751	B
Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there	3751	B
GNK	3751	B
Davis Iron yes yep matter of fact i just saw them last week yep	3751	B
are- are you in that part are you in the south part of town now	3751	B
oh yeah okay	3751	B
you know	3751	B
you know uh Parker Machine Tool down there	3751	B
Bobby Parker	3751	B
there is a place in Hewett called it is a new company called Prime Air	3751	B
that is in Hewett just around the corner from Davis Iron Works	3751	B
yeah they make uh	3751	B
humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for you know hospitals homes something like that it's a new kind-	3751	B
uh yeah	3751	B
oh really	3751	B
huh	3751	B
i will have to stop in there i went i have gone through there uh my oldest son goes to A&M and	3751	B
he is working on his Master's- the Navy sent him there for his Master's mostly in Engineering so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty five	3751	B
that is about the last time i have been through Marlin and Mart	3751	B
there is always a state trooper down there you have got to drive careful	3751	B
between Mart and Marlin they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour	3751	B
huh	3751	B
uh-huh	3751	B
okay_1	3713	A
uh do you cook quite a bit	3713	A
that's good practice though	3713	A
i know when i was single it was uh i wouldn't cook much of anything i think one night i sauteed a pound of mushrooms and that was dinner	3713	A
but uh well right now my husband and i live in uh uh subdivision that we have a dinner club {thingy}	3713	A
and what we do is once a month we'll meet at one house and the host will prepare the entree and provide the drinks and then every one else brings something	3713	A
and then it rotates from month to month you get together with four couples so you only host one time	3713	A
it is really nice but uh	3713	A
well	3713	A
we haven't but i think that'd be great you know do Mexican one time or Chinese the next time thinking the next one we get into that i'll do that	3713	A
but basically the host so far have just been picking you know what we have and then they'll let the people know and they'll uh uh ask people to bring something to compliment it but personally i like to prepare something that i could have done ahead of time	3713	A
because i can't talk and cook at the same time uh if i try you know i- i leave ingredients out but uh	3713	A
we're suppose to be hosting next time i'm thinking of about having beef stroganoff because i can do that ahead of time	3713	A
and	3713	A
really	3713	A
now- now is this one of the dishes that you cook	3713	A
it's really simple so don't don't let it uh	3713	A
what do you cook when you go home	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
no what is it	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
that doesn't bother me anyway so	3713	A
oh you sound like my husband he's a garlic freak too	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
do you uh stir fry	3713	A
do you have a wok	3713	A
well i'd call them up	3713	A
probably works just as well	3713	A
that's something you know we don't do all that often and every time we do it i think why don't we cook this way more often because it is healthy you get a lot of vegetables and everything	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
soy sauce	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
uh-huh	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
um-hum	3713	A
uh not really actually uh i live by myself and so most of my cooking is pretty basic you know just for myself but i cook when i go home my mom doesn't like to cook so	3713	B
i cook all my parents' meals when i go home and that's about_1 the only opportunity i like to but i just you know	3713	B
hard to get motivated to cook for yourself	3713	B
yeah	3713	B
oh	3713	B
oh	3713	B
that's pretty nice	3713	B
well what kind of things do you usually have i mean do you do you usually have like	3713	B
you know ethnic food do you try a different thing every time or	3713	B
oh sure	3713	B
oh yeah	3713	B
oh yeah my mom does that and freezes it a lot of times	3713	B
yeah	3713	B
huh-uh	3713	B
one of my mom's bailiwick	3713	B
i was going to say i kind of i do not know i do	3713	B
odd things i guess	3713	B
um i guess last time i was home was at Christmas and i cooked um	3713	B
i bought some really good beef tenderloin at um Ralph's in Snider Plaza	3713	B
and um i had i my parents have a deep freeze so i bought like oh God i want to say it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze and so i cooked one of them you know and	3713	B
basically have you ever used that DV sauce	3713	B
it's like um	3713	B
a meat a beef enhancer or something like that	3713	B
i mean it might not i- i haven't really looked at the ingredients and it may be one of those things where if if	3713	B
it may have MSG in it i really haven't really looked i do not think it does but it might but	3713	B
uh you know i kind of like sprinkle some of that on it and then take like	3713	B
you know pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them_1 down into the meat	3713	B
and then yeah and then bake it you know and it it always turns out really good i mean course you know the better the the the quality of the meat the better it turns out but	3713	B
you know and if you can leave it out on the counter for a little bit and you know to soak in the the garlic and everything you know that works pretty well but you know that's kind of that's kind of basic and i can do some Chinese and junk like that but	3713	B
some sometimes um i had one but i loaned it to somebody and they never gave it back	3713	B
so i kind of just use a skillet really	3713	B
oh yeah	3713	B
sure and the easy see now that would be an easy thing to do for the dinner party because you could do that in advance you know you i would just get like um	3713	B
you could use do chicken or beef either one and you know kind of chop it up into about inch cubes you know and the marinade i think that is like um	3713	B
oh like a cup of water and maybe three tablespoons of	3713	B
soy and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worcestershire- Worcestershire Worcestershire- or whatever sauce i can't pronounce it	3713	B
i always call it Lea and Perrins because_1 i can't say the name of it and uh garlic and chopped green onions and then you know chop up all of your meat like the night before and stick it in a tupperware dish with the	3713	B
you know with the stuff and let it marinade over night and then just strain out you know the juice and um	3713	B
you know then then you know stir fry the meat and um you can get the cans of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and	3713	B
you can put mushroom	3713	B
think of the job benefits you have	3789	A
the dental insurance	3789	A
um do you work for TI	3789	A
okay hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
hum	3789	A
yeah	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
hm that does sound pretty bogus	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
hm	3789	A
that sounds kind of strange	3789	A
who's your- who's your dental care through	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
um	3789	A
ours is through uh Cigna	3789	A
and it's not too bad i mean i haven't	3789	A
i haven't been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits	3789	A
and uh they haven't- been bad they haven't uh they've been pretty good how about_1 your uh do you have an HMO or	3789	A
you you went to like a regular plan	3789	A
oh okay	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
did it get expensive or	3789	A
um-hum um-hum	3789	A
um-hum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh i personally i- i think HMO's are {scammy} now just because_1 uh it's only five dollars a visit every time i go that's not bad okay and it's five dollars prescription	3789	A
every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway	3789	A
but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking	3789	A
you know and	3789	A
so if i go to make a like i- i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache- i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor	3789	A
and they wouldn't let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just- just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and i'm	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
well i was just really annoyed with them_1 because_1 i uh i- i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you don't give me an appointment i'm just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill	3789	A
before anything happens they're like well wait another day and call us back and i'm like i don't wanna wait another day i want an appointment now	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
yeah it's it's real handy once you're you know if you like my roommate broke his arm	3789	A
and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that	3789	A
and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like	3789	A
i don't know i'm i'm only twenty four years old you know i don't really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years i've only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical	3789	A
so you know for me	3789	A
you know i don't i don't see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know	3789	A
so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible	3789	A
i guess i could've done pretty good with the five dollar visit	3789	A
so	3789	A
wow that's a lot	3789	A
um-hum	3789	A
hum yeah Kaiser's- expensive i mean i think it's uh this year it's like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars	3789	A
yeah that works- that works out pretty handy	3789	A
uh-huh	3789	A
no yeah	3789	A
it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best	3789	A
well i- i think uh so far they've been pretty- pretty good except the medical uh	3789	B
not not the medical the dental insurance	3789	B
yeah i- yeah i think um	3789	B
i know i went to have a tooth pulled	3789	B
and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldn't uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing condition	3789	B
you know how you wait you wait as long as you can	3789	B
sometimes to- to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it really- i- i just thought that was that was pretty bad	3789	B
and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell- fell off and uh	3789	B
they paid for the the cap but they wouldn't pay for the build up	3789	B
and i didn't understand that either	3789	B
uh well uh it's it's a part of Aetna	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
well i had an HMO up to this year i switched	3789	B
yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh	3789	B
you know because	3789	B
yeah it's gotten expensive because_1 right now i'm i'm only- i only have myself so i don't have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
really	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
right	3789	B
right	3789	B
right	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah that was a problem that i had with them_1 toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and	3789	B
and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away	3789	B
and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them_1 i got okay but uh and i didn't go back	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah that's what i thought about later i would've probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
right	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah after i really thought about it some more the i- i really could've done that but um	3789	B
i was hospitalized uh	3789	B
uh about_1 three years ago i had some surgery	3789	B
and Kaiser was really good for that because_1 i didn't have to pay any of it at all	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
wow	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
well my uh my Kaiser premium	3789	B
would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year	3789	B
and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that	3789	B
yeah	3789	B
so i went back to Aetna because i- i won't have to pay anything	3789	B
and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick	3789	B
you know	3789	B
um-hum	3789	B
where in California you live	3708	B
okay i was down that way once but i don't think i remember that is it on the coast	3708	B
i went all the way down to Imperial Beach once that's far as i went	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yes i guess we're gonna talk about camping is that right	3708	B
okay	3708	B
well yeah my wife and i like to camp um usually just on short trips like a weekend or long weekend	3708	B
and we generally go to uh State or National parks	3708	B
uh-huh yeah well we don't really care for fishing anything that that resembles work uh so we just uh what we do is hike and take pictures that's about all	3708	B
well Texas has a pretty nice system of state parks we've got um state parks just all over the place on different kinds of terrain and most of them	3708	B
uh	3708	B
well Texas has every thing from desert to uh swamp so i don't think they have too many	3708	B
they don't have too many swamps in Arizona i don't think i don't think i've uh seen too many swamps in Arizona	3708	B
now we may do some camping- camping in Arizona though i've got uh my uh brother and sister and father all live in Sedonia now Sedonia yeah	3708	B
what is it	3708	B
Mayer	3708	B
oh yeah uh	3708	B
i- i think i remember going through there is that between Prescott and Jerome or over the other way	3708	B
uh-huh well it be	3708	B
yeah i think i do remember a little wide place in the road called Mayer well anyway they uh everybody there says that you know there are places you can camp uh right around Sedonia there are	3708	B
yeah	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yeah well we we do we like actually we like to get off uh where there aren't too many people around	3708	B
we did find a nice uh prospect uh down on the gulf	3708	B
um there's a uh national wildlife- wildlife refuge called Urandus i don't know if you've heard of it that's where the whooping cranes go in the winter or at least where a lot of them go	3708	B
and uh there's and island right off that called Matagorda and uh you can take a ferry boat out there and it's uh completely uh pretty much anyway complete wilderness island	3708	B
sort of like a big sand bar you know you wanna make sure there aren't any big storms coming	3708	B
but uh then you can uh take a uh take a little bus across the island to the to the gulf side rather than the bay side and uh	3708	B
it's really nice out there lots of sea birds	3708	B
all at once or all at once	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
yeah well i sort of like to feel less tied down rather than more tied down when i go camping and	3708	B
uh-huh	3708	B
well i really like Arizona i like uh uh couple times this last year i've made it up to Jerome just to enjoy the altitude and everything and it's really	3708	B
neat up there somehow	3708	B
i met the town historian	3708	B
uh it's near National- it's near uh San Diego it's called National City	3708	A
yeah it's just a little rinky-dink town but	3708	A
most people don't go there it's really not a good neighborhood	3708	A
yeah it's nicer down there	3708	A
unfortunately i need to be near near the naval base so	3708	A
my choice of living quarters is limited so um are you ready to begin	3708	A
right	3708	A
okay i'll push the button hang on	3708	A
{alrighty} there we go	3708	A
so do you go camping at all	3708	A
yeah my husband and i like going for the long weekends we usually like going up to one of the camping grounds that have a lake near it	3708	A
because_1 we like to fish and camp	3708	A
yeah i- i like hiking unfortunately around here there's not too many spots to do stuff like that	3708	A
yeah i'm from Arizona and they've got a lot of it there too	3708	A
they've also got desert desert uh i don't know what you call it but	3708	A
sites in the desert they have a special name for it	3708	A
i don't think i'd like the swamp but mountains and deserts	3708	A
huh	3708	A
no it's pretty much dry	3708	A
oh really do you know where Mayer's at	3708	A
Mayer outside Prescott	3708	A
yeah	3708	A
over the other way it's actually if you blinked you'd miss it	3708	A
oh there's a lot of beautiful camping places around Sedonia and they're getting they're getting more of them_1	3708	A
they're just doing it slowly but surely	3708	A
but um i like the rustic kind of camping	3708	A
yeah	3708	A
uh-huh	3708	A
oh that'd be neat	3708	A
really	3708	A
right	3708	A
that sounds like it'd be nice	3708	A
yeah unfortunately my husband and i haven't been able to go camping because_1 i just had two kids two- two boys and	3708	A
huh	3708	A
well no no i spaced them out about a year a part	3708	A
but until they get a little bit older we really don't want to take them_1 out camping with us	3708	A
yeah when i go camping i like to get out and hike and do things and when you have little kids you really can't do that very much	3708	A
right that's the object of it you know get out and feel free and do things you don't normally get to do	3708	A
but um yeah we haven't got to go lately but when we go we we're from Arizona so when we go back on vacation next year we'll get to go	3708	A
which should be nice	3708	A
it is actually	3708	A
well i suppose we both have credit cards	3781	B
yeah	3781	B
well i do use them um	3781	B
i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i- i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to	3781	B
um	3781	B
but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh	3781	B
they all can build up	3781	B
uh i think they're handy i just get	3781	B
uh i don't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks	3781	B
when you go shopping	3781	B
well do you use credit cards	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
your grandmother huh	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
that's good	3781	B
oh that's that's wonderful	3781	B
well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing it's really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building	3781	B
but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand	3781	B
um-hum	3781	B
um yeah	3781	B
well that's good i'm looking right now i'm kind- kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them_1 have gotten higher	3781	B
and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a	3781	B
Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didn't write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think it's eighteen percent or something so	3781	B
think i want to find something that has a lower rate	3781	B
no i haven't	3781	B
is is that the one from Sears	3781	B
okay	3781	B
okay	3781	B
uh-huh oh	3781	B
oh they give you money back for using your credit card	3781	B
oh i didn't know that	3781	B
hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards	3781	B
i worked with- at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take	3781	B
until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so	3781	B
you know now they'll take the Discover but i still don't know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard	3781	B
but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and	3781	B
American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two	3781	B
um-hum yeah i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldn't be able to use them	3781	B
but uh i- i do like my Dillard's i have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop	3781	B
and i do- do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores	3781	B
but	3781	B
well yes no not too much more about credit cards	3781	B
okay well	3781	B
good talking to you Beth	3781	B
good luck	3781	B
you too bye	3781	B
um-hum yeah they seem to be a part of life	3781	A
yeah how do you use them	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah i use a few i um	3781	A
i watched my grandmother go into debt on them and so i've and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so	3781	A
basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um	3781	A
i generally and my husband it turns out i've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month	3781	A
so that we don't pay any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
yeah yeah that's what i feel	3781	A
so	3781	A
um-hum it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them_1 in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come but sometimes i forget and	3781	A
so you know a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um	3781	A
yeah have you ever used Discover card	3781	A
yeah i'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off but you know	3781	A
um i think Sears originally put it out but it's um it's pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take Discover	3781	A
and there's no annual service fee which is good you know and then um	3781	A
they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back	3781	A
yeah basically that's it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but i'm not sure	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah i think it's best to keep the number down that you have	3781	A
so	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
uh-huh	3781	A
um-hum	3781	A
yeah	3781	A
well do you have anything else to say or	3781	A
okay i don't think i do either so well it was good talking to you	3781	A
okay have a good evening bye-bye	3781	A
do you	3707	B
how old is it	3707	B
uh you you're you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think	3707	B
well	3707	B
i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh i've had dogs through the years right now i've got two	3707	B
and three cats but	3707	B
uh and uh my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix and we watched it this summer for two to three months and it wasn't trained quite fully either	3707	B
and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog	3707	B
i don't know i i'm old fashioned and when i got my my dogs when they when they did something i hollered at them_1 and threw them_1 outside they say that's not the way to do it now but you're just supposed to	3707	B
no just just you- put them_1 outside i guess unless you catch- catch them_1 in the act	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
no you- no you don't wanna do that but uh	3707	B
does- does- does it just wanna sniff around and	3707	B
does it just wanna sniff around and play when it's outside	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
have- have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
that's nothing huh	3707	B
well it it it'll it'll catch on pretty soon i'll i'll i'll {betcha} i i have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever and she's gone the other way because she's so old she doesn't have much control	3707	B
so we're battling with that problem and she still feels good uh she can't hear worth a darn or see very well but she's got a great appetite and she knows we're there by smell	3707	B
she'll be sixteen in May	3707	B
and yeah but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years so we're putting up with all her accidents	3707	B
um-hum	3707	B
yeah	3707	B
does it oh	3707	B
uh-huh	3707	B
uh you know maybe you need- you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes	3707	B
oh	3707	B
well you know where we went we went to the junior college Richland	3707	B
and we took my my daughter was living at home then and she took our Golden Retriever or not the Golden Retriever the Norwegian Elk Hound over there and	3707	B
it it it's a pretty good class and they did pretty good except this dog is she's just pretty she's not smart so she didn't learn a lot but it i think it calmed her down a little bit and she's used to being around other dogs now	3707	B
i think it was like a six week program	3707	B
uh i think it was one night a week for like six weeks and uh you know it was a group class outside	3707	B
it was fairly reasonable too	3707	B
yeah they're pretty- they're usually a high strung dog aren't they	3707	B
um our our friend has a	3707	B
uh we have a Sheltie Collie a miniature Sheltie	3707	A
yeah it's about oh about_1 six months old	3707	A
and we're trying- we're we- we live in an apartment so we don't have a yard so it has to stay- stay- stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it	3707	A
it's about six months	3707	A
really	3707	A
but they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs but i guess every one one every one one of them_1 or or every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because_1 this one isn't	3707	A
um-hum	3707	A
yeah	3707	A
so how'd y'all how do you what's the best method	3707	A
right	3707	A
stand outside with them_1 until they	3707	A
well we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult and	3707	A
you know you don't wanna you don't wanna spank it or scare it or anything like that so	3707	A
yeah we we try to take it	3707	A
you know it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside and you know and then it runs right inside and it does it huh	3707	A
yeah a lot of times and you know it it won't it's whole job outside and it comes inside	3707	A
uh yeah we've tried that and uh	3707	A
you know there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go so and he chews on plants and all that but you know that's natural for a little puppy huh	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
oh that's sad	3707	A
huh	3707	A
how old is it	3707	A
man that's sad	3707	A
oh of course not	3707	A
i couldn't	3707	A
that is really sad what what's the deal we- we try to we're trying to take it on walks now you know	3707	A
and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash	3707	A
and so it i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it i mean it just goes like a mad dog i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and	3707	A
it's you know i mean it's not even close to even being trained on a leash	3707	A
um-hum well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they	3707	A
sometimes misuse- misuse their	3707	A
license or whatever you know and they treat them_1 bad	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
uh-huh	3707	A
how long did it take	3707	A
every what	3707	A
oh really	3707	A
well Sheltie Collies are you know timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and	3707	A
yeah yeah and uh if they're not accustomed to something they they're really scared so	3707	A
family with children or	3741	A
oh do you	3741	A
so what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them	3741	A
that's true and then you just get to spoil the grandkids and send them home right that's what my mom always says	3741	A
yeah i have one little daughter she's just a year and a half	3741	A
and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like	3741	A
she's not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing her attention span's only a couple of minutes i think and then its on to the new little mess	3741	A
i'm sure you remember those days	3741	A
but and we try and sit and read to her she's really good she'll bring us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff but	3741	A
i can't they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else	3741	A
or else she loses her loses a attention- the attention's not that interesting to her for very long	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
uh	3741	A
uh	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
oh yeah	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
uh-huh and it	3741	A
yeah i- i uh my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and	3741	A
i i've carried it through i love to read now and and uh that's why we've we've made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we don't you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that	3741	A
that uh it's something good to do but	3741	A
yeah it's it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and it's the same one over and over and over again it seems like but	3741	A
but i guess like you say she it's something so she at least she gets in the habit	3741	A
but	3741	A
yeah we uh my wife works at a day care part time and she's able to take her with her there but she she works with a lot of kids whose parents you know it's they drop them_1 off at six in the morning and then pick them_1 up at six at night and	3741	A
then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder	3741	A
you know there's	3741	A
there's a lot to be said with- with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids that's for sure	3741	A
other than just you know putting them in front of the TV or something like that	3741	A
i have a kind of a hard time with that but	3741	A
it's uh i think it's fair to say you get more of a there's a lot more love and they don't have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the parents are spending time doing stuff with them	3741	A
so	3741	A
how many children did you have- do you have	3741	A
three and how many grandchildren	3741	A
eight oh that's good	3741	A
yeah we uh my mom and dad just well they have three grandchildren now each of my brother and sister each we each have one but	3741	A
they're they're fond of like i say they like to keep them_1 for a couple of hours but boy when they send them home with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death	3741	A
they like them_1 but	3741	A
uh they they're looking forward they like i say they've been looking forward to the time when they could just send them_1 home with their with their parents as opposed to having to keep us all the time	3741	A
so	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
yeah well how do you do	3741	A
how did you do that i mean you know as far as having to tell them_1 no or slapping their hands or something like that that's that's what we struggle with	3741	A
uh-huh	3741	A
um-hum	3741	A
yeah well that's the important thing and they probably appreciate all you did for them_1 so	3741	A
yeah	3741	A
we're just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my mom is just you wait you know you'll get all that you ever gave so i could be in trouble but	3741	A
i say they they're a handful that's for sure we i just last night uh she	3741	A
uh yes in fact i'm i'm i've got grandchildren	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
uh spending uh	3741	B
oh just visiting back and forth fortunately when your children get up in their thirties	3741	B
they finally grow up you get to enjoy them	3741	B
right right right	3741	B
yeah do you have children	3741	B
oh	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
oh yeah	3741	B
oh yeah yeah	3741	B
um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah i- i think one of the very most important	3741	B
was i- i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to read to them	3741	B
uh and get them to love books	3741	B
before they ever start to preschool	3741	B
uh	3741	B
i was very fortunate in having an older sister who read to me constantly and uh so i was i went to school in the days before public kindergarten	3741	B
but uh uh i had practically all the fairy stories read to me before i started to school so	3741	B
uh i uh i made great strides and i i'm sure you'll experience the same thing	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
oh yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah yeah	3741	B
um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
i have three three yeah	3741	B
uh eight	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
um-hum	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah yeah yeah	3741	B
i i think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause some days when you're feeling pretty good you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder then on days when you don't feel well	3741	B
what do you mean you didn't do this	3741	B
oh oh gee i- i- i- i did a lot of the wrong things i'm sure	3741	B
but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if	3741	B
i i tried to keep as few rules but well really about the only rule i had was they couldn't play on the top bunk and they had to confine their eating to the kitchen	3741	B
so	3741	B
yeah yeah and uh so	3741	B
uh	3741	B
i don't know they all turned around- out okay so	3741	B
well i- i think so and um	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
yeah	3741	B
um well i have i have two kids in school and	3757	B
and in comparing it with people who live in other parts of the world one of the things that- things wrong is that our our schools our kids seem to go to school less	3757	B
of- of the year than than kids in other countries	3757	B
um it seems like uh the long summer break is something that	3757	B
only	3757	B
uh only occurs in the United States	3757	B
um do you have any kids in school	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
well some of the- some of the uh schools are trying to go to more of a year around system	3757	B
and uh i guess there's pros and cons to that too i know if if if it happened here i would hope that uh you know i have uh two children that are two years a part i would just hope they were in the same system so	3757	B
if you wanna take a vacation you could	3757	B
yeah	3757	B
it could it could one of the other um things is that um	3757	B
uh there's been a lot of talk about uh American schools uh getting behind in science compared to uh lot of European schools and and Japan also	3757	B
that their schools are teaching uh more of the science sciences and putting out better	3757	B
uh graduates when in math and science uh for the future you know technology in various countries	3757	B
and that's not a favorite subject for either of my my kids it's probably not	3757	B
for anyone but it just seems like uh those are the criticisms criticisms you hear over and over about the the the American public school system and this is probably why a lot people go to private schools instead	3757	B
some of the some of the people that i work with uh they're they're some from various parts of the of the world and and uh course everybody likes to think their system's the best but the the ones in	3757	B
England and and then Germany seem seem to uh have some logical points about	3757	B
you know why do why do kids need a three month break in the summer	3757	B
and i i think that dates back to	3757	B
when America was agricultural and nature and and children needed to help on farms and it's been quite a while since that's been the case for most part now	3757	B
and it seems though that's one of the things that ought to to change	3757	B
uh i'm not i'm not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and	3757	B
and uh Christmas time for the other you know the other one	3757	B
and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with uh families going on vacation	3757	B
tends to make some crowds	3757	B
did you go through the public school system	3757	B
uh uh uh yeah i did too and everyone else in my family but seems like uh	3757	B
uh if people can afford it the number of people go the private school route but that's of course not available to to the average person with	3757	B
yes uh-huh	3757	B
that i have mixed feelings about that too i guess whether or not they miss the social interaction a part of it	3757	B
yeah that that would help	3757	B
yeah uh-huh	3757	B
yeah the i i think that's why a lot of people go to the home schooling they they disagree with what they're exposed to either for religious reasons or or other reasons	3757	B
um	3757	B
the other thing that's happening now i guess is is	3757	B
well Tom what do you think about our public school systems today	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
no i don't	3757	A
so i'm a little bit out of it i can look back to my to when i was in school which is getting further and further away and also i have a niece and nephew that are in school out in California and i hear a little a bit about from my sister about	3757	A
things going on yeah	3757	A
yeah they're moving to that out there	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
uh-huh i hear that they that in at least in the system that's going out um in California where that i'm familiar with that they do put families on the same schedule	3757	A
so seems like that could get a little difficult to do that but	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah yeah	3757	A
yeah well i hadn't thought about those things but those are problems um	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
right	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah there's no need for it anymore	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
right yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah i did	3757	A
right i know a lot of people that are home schooling their children you know just teaching them at home and	3757	A
and for lots of different reasons you know	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
i know that a lot of them um they hook up with like a home schooling system and they get together the kids get together for lots of activities and outings and stuff like that	3757	A
yeah i think that helps yeah i wonder too i have mixed feelings about it but um	3757	A
i know that uh you know i spot when i thought of problems in the school system it's not really the fault of the school system but there's a lot of	3757	A
you know it's just uh	3757	A
i don't know kids are exposed to a lot that you can't shelter them eventually- eventually but it's hard at a young age some of the pressures and	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
um-hum	3757	A
yeah	3757	A
it was Lee right yeah Lee what-	3765	B
i'm Bob	3765	B
you know the Arabs world doesn't do a lot of the things i like but they don't have too many repeat offenders- offenders in drugs and murder and a few other things	3765	B
you steal they cut off the hand you steal again they cut off both hands it takes care of it quick	3765	B
it takes care of it quick	3765	B
uh two wrongs don't make a right	3765	B
yeah	3765	B
yeah in Texas uh some private enterprise built a few prisons or jails	3765	B
and with- with the hope that the over flow from the county or the state would kind of get to them_1	3765	B
but uh see the evidently the counties and the cities are too scared to use them_1 because_1 of the expense but uh they're having trouble now paying their bills because_1 they're not getting any customers	3765	B
i don't understand that	3765	B
years ago i sat on a rape trial and we let the guy off wasn't enough evidence although i'm sure he did it	3765	B
um-hum	3765	B
i think you need to get tough with them_1 and quit calling them_1 i don't think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor manual-	3765	B
and as tough as you can make it no coddling no kissing their and nothing- nothing just say hey you committed a wrong and you're going to serve some hard hard time	3765	B
and uh	3765	B
there in San Francisco you have a interesting place called the Delancy Street House have you heard of it	3765	B
hum	3765	B
we was talking to somebody the other day over there in Japan uh	3765	B
they have a very low crime problem	3765	B
and one of the things they do to them_1 in Japan is they publish the name and address	3765	B
and families of the person convicted of a crime and there is such embarrassment to the family that they have to move out of the neighborhood and move to another part of the country	3765	B
well- well our family sense of family has eroded i'm afraid in this country but	3765	B
i don't think it'll work here but over there the the way they're doing it it seems to be effective	3765	B
i've heard that i've heard that no i haven't	3765	B
uh	3765	B
terribly expensive yeah	3765	B
it's Lee	3765	A
uh and you're Bob	3765	A
uh	3765	A
i've been uh	3765	A
thinking about the topic and i think it's uh	3765	A
going to be interesting to see what happens as the criminal justice system	3765	A
responds to the tremendous	3765	A
i guess over load in	3765	A
uh cases they say that these drug cases	3765	A
alone are swamping the criminal justice system	3765	A
i've	3765	A
i've heard that i've heard that uh	3765	A
yeah i've even heard that the other end of the continuum some judges who are arguing that uh because the system is so over loaded that	3765	A
uh they recommend decriminalizing some of these things because the courts can't possibly handle all the cases	3765	A
i think its going to be very interesting because its uh	3765	A
it's really become a major expense for us as a society	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
well you know the other-	3765	A
the other thing that i think is interesting about this is that they've been experimenting for years in the civil justice system with alternatives to courts where you can rent a judge and i'm wondering whether we'll eventually go to renting a jury	3765	A
um and finding ways uh like The People's Court to try some of these cases	3765	A
i think uh the expense is is enormous have you ever sat on a jury	3765	A
yeah well it's uh	3765	A
it's it's a major undertaking i mean people have to give up their work and and a lot of their time	3765	A
and uh i- i just think it can overwhelm us pretty easily uh when i hear what people are saying about just the sheer volume of the cases	3765	A
well there are a lot of people who think that that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh	3765	A
it's push come to shove time as far as i can tell in terms of the sheer volume of this stuff	3765	A
yeah oh yeah it's well known and and it's consistent with what you're talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess	3765	A
you know we're going to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system	3765	A
um	3765	A
it's gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh	3765	A
the topic is an interesting one because of the um	3765	A
uh the price you pay for freedom i guess	3765	A
you know the the requirement that that people be given a trial and and	3765	A
and then then the issue becomes what do you do once somebody's found guilty i suppose	3765	A
yeah-	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
yeah	3765	A
yeah have you uh in Dallas uh seen the newspapers ever print the names of people who were uh uh uh picked up as johns uh in under cover operations	3765	A
they they they've done that in San Francisco and uh you know it's gonna be interesting to see how all these things change as as we look at the cost of it because	3765	A
um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybody's entitled to a lawyer but not everybody's entitled to a doctor and we must spend	3765	A
i don't know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we're talking about are going to contribute to change and i don't know uh	3765	A
okay what do you think	3719	A
right um-hum	3719	A
yeah the class sizes are too large and they don't pay the teachers enough	3719	A
like in Dallas they have too many administrators they're top-heavy	3719	A
and uh they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the	3719	A
the text	3719	A
having um mistakes in them_1	3719	A
and uh a lot of them_1 aren't like the history books aren't historically correct they they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened	3719	A
well i think they need to	3719	A
do whatever they can like um i think	3719	A
um Massachusetts put a priority on education and and um	3719	A
bringing in industry and recruiting	3719	A
and they made a lot of difference in that state and in Texas i think we're like twenty ninth in spending	3719	A
you know and they put through this Robin Hood bill but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly	3719	A
and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to um make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because_1 most of the time the teachers spend	3719	A
disciplining the the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now	3719	A
so	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
yeah	3719	A
and uh i i think they changed the way the ladder is now that it takes a longer time for- for you to qualify for a higher salary and uh it's it's um	3719	A
it's more subjective than it was before	3719	A
so	3719	A
i don't know you know i don't know what incentive teacher has to stay in teaching	3719	A
i just have uh one daughter she's six now she's going to Richardson Public Schools	3719	A
um-hum	3719	A
right	3719	A
right but the worst school districts are Dallas Garland Carrollton	3719	A
um Coppell really doesn't matter much it's it's is not at the bottom and the best is uh Highland Park Richardson and Plano	3719	A
she's six	3719	A
yeah	3719	A
and you know and she's learning to read so and she can do a little bit of math now so	3719	A
oh uh Valley View Mall	3719	A
oh yeah there's supposed to all- all the calls are supposed to be from a different phone so	3719	A
that's where i am and they have a lot of pay phones here so	3719	A
you know	3719	A
and i and i don't know uh uh they cut back on the since Mark White passed that bill about	3719	A
cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit	3719	A
because um	3719	A
i was talking to a lady the other day and that that's the first thing she said her her both her children were in band and they'd quit	3719	A
and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend- spend all of his time on band	3719	A
right and he he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the Lewisville School District	3719	A
and uh you know it's just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that	3719	A
everything should be equal you know and there's no reason you already spend all that time in band there's no reason that he should practice more than an hour a day outside of band if he if he even has the energy especially in marching season	3719	A
you know	3719	A
right and and what do you do when you are taking calculus and uh chemistry and physics two and	3719	A
something wrong with our school systems yes	3719	B
nobody wants to go to public schools um	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
just- what do you think can be done about that	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i agree	3719	B
i've got a friend who's uh a very talented teacher and has given it up	3719	B
uh in Carrollton uh just because_1 it's not i mean she just can't stand the paper work um	3719	B
you know it's uh	3719	B
and she's not paid enough she gets more as a filing claims for an insurance company which she's not even trained to do	3719	B
so	3719	B
i think it's real discouraging	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i don't either	3719	B
well do you have children	3719	B
out of the Dallas School District	3719	B
basically	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
i don't have any but if i did i don't know that i could i would want them to be in a Dallas School District	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
how old is your daughter	3719	B
so she's just started this year	3719	B
where are you speaking from i can hear a lot of background noise	3719	B
oh	3719	B
yeah	3719	B
wow that is funny	3719	B
well	3719	B
um-hum	3719	B
um-hum	3719	B
and demanded the children right	3719	B
uh-huh	3719	B
hm	3719	B
well that goes along with football though too you know uh	3719	B
all righty	3732	A
so how- what do you think of capital punishment	3732	A
oh does it	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
well i feel that way the only exception i think is qualifies for capital punishment is repeat offenders where the offender actually murders people repeatedly	3732	A
like serial killers or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge and then gotten out on parole i don't think they should be able to get out on parole and do it again	3732	A
that's the only time i think it's really	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
yeah exactly	3732	A
and i think i think those types of people deserve capital punishment	3732	A
but i think they should restrict it strictly for repeat offenders or like i said serial killers because i mean a lot of times- not a lot of times but quite- quite a few times they've convicted innocent people on the first time	3732	A
but you know if they've been convicted like three times you know there something's wrong	3732	A
so i think that's the only time it's really a necessary	3732	A
uh	3732	A
the guilty party	3732	A
right	3732	A
but that's really the only time when i agree with it	3732	A
most of the time i don't think it's a good idea because_1 like you said there have been cases where they've convicted the wrong people	3732	A
just because of circumstances	3732	A
but in Arizona which is where i'm originally from	3732	A
they had a big thing about capital punishment there because we had like two serial killers within six months caught	3732	A
and they had a big thing about whether they should you know go for capital punishment or not but it's not used in Arizona	3732	A
so they had a problem with it	3732	A
unfortunately all the people got was sent to jail for a couple of years until they get paroled	3732	A
unfortunately one of them_1 killed a friend of mine so i was very much involved	3732	A
and when he got out on parole i was like	3732	A
go ahead get out on parole	3732	A
and	3732	A
after that i had i had to tangle with him and the police caught him the second time and they still wouldn't do anything except send him to jail so	3732	A
i definitely believe if they're repeat offenders they should	3732	A
be	3732	A
something to be done with them_1 other than just sitting there for two years and then getting out and doing it again	3732	A
but a lot of states have outlawed capital punishment	3732	A
i don't know which states in general	3732	A
oh really	3732	A
hum	3732	A
huh i didn't know that	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
really	3732	A
hum i didn't know that	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
but	3732	A
i don't know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays it's like i think people have to be off the wall to do them_1 but	3732	A
i still don't believe capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders	3732	A
but	3732	A
i don't know i	3732	A
once i finish law school i'll have	3732	A
more probably more views on it	3732	A
i'll be able to do something about it then	3732	A
oh do they	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
that would be the more humane way of doing it	3732	A
yeah	3732	A
or stuck in a gas chamber until they finally pass on	3732	A
but i know a couple of states	3732	A
still believe in the hanging but	3732	A
i don't i don't go for that either	3732	A
well Texas has capital punishment	3732	B
yep and uh	3732	B
they go through a set of appeals that lasts seven years	3732	B
and uh	3732	B
there are so many cases here like Sixty Minutes is on right now here there are so many cases here where they proved that they've convicted the wrong person	3732	B
that i'm against it they should just give them_1 life in prison	3732	B
right	3732	B
yeah exactly	3732	B
right uh-huh	3732	B
well like in your state Charles Manson	3732	B
or the guy who killed all those children	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
right	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
something's going on right	3732	B
yeah i think so too after after it's gone that far then they pretty well have a	3732	B
enough proof that that person's	3732	B
they can't be rehabilitated- rehabilitated either so yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
right i never heard about those	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
yeah	3732	B
right	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
and that's that's the reason that Ted Bundy supposedly went to Florida	3732	B
that was his primary goal was to to have the death penalty	3732	B
because he started out in Washington and Oregon and traveled all the way across the country	3732	B
they had um	3732	B
Mark Harmon played him they had a movie about it a few years ago	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
and then of course there was a lot of publicity about it um the days before they killed him	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
so	3732	B
and he was really you know he was off the wall so	3732	B
right	3732	B
and-	3732	B
yeah and some of the ways i think that um the way that Texas um executes the prisoners is probably the most humane way they use- they do it by injection	3732	B
yeah instead of you know the electric chair the gas chamber that's	3732	B
you know	3732	B
yeah well they you know they just go to sleep and and then eventually they die	3732	B
instead of being you know fried or	3732	B
or	3732	B
yeah fighting fighting for breath right um-hum	3732	B
um-hum	3732	B
okay you ready to discuss the the topic	3738	A
okay the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago	3738	A
are you ready for that okay pardon me	3738	A
okay well uh there's uh it's kind of an interesting- interesting topic and one that i think is quite fascinating because	3738	A
uh couple of years ago i guess uh not very not many- not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the United States but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was	3738	A
basically in a	3738	A
you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing	3738	A
you know you had the the Russians against the Americans the Communists against the Free World	3738	A
and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where	3738	A
uh couple of years ago we had uh America uh was a one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned and now we're	3738	A
having a very tough time in a recessionary period we're also have a very humongous trade deficit and uh	3738	A
and that's kind of frightening also you know a couple of years ago ten fifteen- fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life	3738	A
and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every you know every couple years and possibly five- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime	3738	A
and so i think uh	3738	A
you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and a lot- and uh	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
true	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yes yes	3738	A
true true	3738	A
um-hum well do you do you think that's good or bad	3738	A
you think that's great	3738	A
that something- yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn	3738	A
and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and	3738	A
when that's over with that's that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular	3738	A
um education and and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to to expand ourselves also	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yes i agree with that i agree with that so i i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn	3738	A
learn how to adapt learn how to grow in the in their college or whatever education they might take so that that's good that's good	3738	A
um-hum	3738	A
yeah i i- i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress uh for those people that are laid off and also for those people	3738	A
that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place	3738	A
and it affects-	3738	A
what's the topic	3738	B
okay	3738	B
you bet i'll let you lead out	3738	B
i'll let you lead out	3738	B
i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also	3738	B
so if you look at Russia and what's happened over there i think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing	3738	B
i think was i look at the economic problems in the United States right now one of the things you wonder is what's that going to do to us	3738	B
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i mean i think it's great that you can have three or four different careers in your life i think it must've been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years	3738	B
so i think that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing	3738	B
and the uncertainty of whether you're gonna have a job is not as good but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs	3738	B
i think it's great	3738	B
oh yeah	3738	B
i think one of the problems with with education in as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education- education is prepared to help people make those changes	3738	B
it still seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession	3738	B
and not giving them_1 the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think's gonna be a hard thing for for people to face	3738	B
yeah	3738	B
there probably needs to be some training on how to to to to adjust to these changes as they come about	3738	B
i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them_1 even ideas of how to make those changes now	3738	B
so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them	3738	B
um-hum	3738	B
no i don't no	3785	B
not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
and do you have any children	3785	B
uh-huh	3785	B
yeah	3785	B
yeah yeah	3785	B
i think it's probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than it's realistic that that the school system can provide	3785	B
and in conjunction a lot of um school districts' funds have been cut because of at least in California that's the case it's probably the case elsewhere too	3785	B
i don't even know if it's just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it it's a matter of	3785	B
well it's kind of a philosophical- philosophical expectation about who's responsible for discipline you know it's	3785	B
it	3785	B
you know you- you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and	3785	B
in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for what's important in terms of values and i think that's probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess	3785	B
i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
maybe TV's a bigger um	3785	B
competitor for their time	3785	B
and when we were kids	3785	B
um-hum	3785	B
yeah	3785	B
that's a good point just learning the discipline to to to study	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to speak- speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home	3785	B
our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are	3785	B
well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um	3785	B
i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco	3785	B
in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um	3785	B
i have to really do the research to find out	3785	B
whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that	3785	B
it's really the the expense is a real issue when you think about	3785	B
um-hum um-hum	3785	B
well i don't know how it is in your community i know that um	3785	B
in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually it's not so much in the city actually it's outside more in the east- Oakland or east bay	3785	B
um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that they're getting getting what they want in the public schools so they're almost like public-	3785	B
school teacher or do you have anything to do with anything in schools or	3785	A
no huh	3785	A
no uh not a lot i've got a couple of friends that work uh as teachers or you know in in different school districts and different things but uh	3785	A
i	3785	A
i have a daughter that's only eighteen months though so we haven't got exposed too much to that but	3785	A
you can sure see where it seems like uh	3785	A
there's a lot of concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education i- i kind of wonder i don't know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or exactly what	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
for them to get	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
sure	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
well they've been cut yeah i just it seems like more and more with uh more families having to resort to you know to two incomes and stuff there's not the time that they spend and so they like you say they expect the the schools to do more of it but hell there's only so many in hours a day	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
oh you know i think that's a good point it's really a good point	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
yeah i uh you know it seems like i remember on school nights you know i was never outside past eight you know maybe nine o'clock at the very latest	3785	A
whether i was in doing homework or not you know i may not have been but yet there was that influence in the home to where i was at least you know getting prepared for the next day or whatever and and you're you know you're right in saying you don't see a lot of that there's out running around and uh doing a lot of different things that	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
TV and Nintendo	3785	A
yeah that's probably true there's a lot more uh	3785	A
yeah that's true i know you know i didn't appreciate i	3785	A
i was you know fortunate to where i could i kind of breezed through high school without too much problem stuff and and didn't really learn how to study that much until i hit college	3785	A
but boy i sure wish now that i had picked that up earlier because_1 you know took me a couple of years in college before i really started getting the grades going and	3785	A
you know it affects your whole life especially when you hit college if you don't you know do as well as you can it can it can follow you for quite a while so	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
to sit and study and i don't know it's it's you know i only have the the one daughter and she's quite young but it makes you a little nervous to	3785	A
know what they have to deal with you know in the future and get prepared for them_1 but	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
do you have any children at all or	3785	A
oh yeah	3785	A
same boat	3785	A
yeah have you uh have you ever considered private schools at all or	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
uh-huh	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
yeah	3785	A
yeah that's true that's true yeah i- i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh	3785	A
sometimes i wonder if they can get that same thing in a in a private high- school or	3785	A
or not	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3785	A
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
do you have gang problems	3772	B
well i'm a school principal	3772	B
um-hum elementary school	3772	B
well its elementary school	3772	B
elementary but i have gang problems	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
i'm in a part of Dallas where there's a lot of gang activity and my i have through the sixth grade	3772	B
but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old	3772	B
and they get recruited	3772	B
so uh	3772	B
we we have really very significant problems	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
yeah	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
its its surprising to me that it's that true there because the only time i've ever been to Utah	3772	B
i spent a week on the Brigham Young campus at a workshop	3772	B
and it was very uh	3772	B
dramatically different that the people you saw than what we see here because you had no minorities you know and	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
but of course you you have a lot of parents that are not really parenting much	3772	B
you have that in Utah	3772	B
you have that in Utah	3772	B
because i would think that big Mormon influence there would uh	3772	B
um-hum	3772	B
well i- i work in an an area of town like my school	3772	B
is about seventy five percent Anglo and that's very unusual in the in the Dallas Public Schools	3772	B
but it's very it's like the lowest socioeconomic Anglos	3772	B
yeah it's it's what in the South we call poor white trash	3772	B
and then the other uh significant percentage i have is Hispanic	3772	B
and course that's growing	3772	B
but the kids that i have	3772	B
the biggest discipline problems with are Anglo children	3772	B
and i i've got lots of Anglo children who are just	3772	B
not really wanted by anybody	3772	B
well and for example i have a boy now he checked out today	3772	B
he's fourteen he's in the sixth grade he lived with his mother in Mississippi he had been to he thought ten or twelve schools in Mississippi	3772	B
then his mother now his mother and father aren't divorced but they don't live together in a long time his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child support for his children	3772	B
that they couldn't afford to keep her children anymore so they sent them_1 here	3772	B
and here he was with his father and his father's pregnant girlfriend	3772	B
and they pawned all his personal belongings like he had a Nintendo and a VCR and some stuff they pawned that	3772	B
and he's just been tearing my school up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to Mississippi	3772	B
and today they checked him out to send him back to Mississippi	3772	B
now those kids	3772	B
yeah but	3772	B
yeah but those kids are	3772	B
ready fodder for gangs	3772	B
sure they belong gives them_1 something to belong to gives them_1 identity gives them_1 importance	3772	B
gives them_1 a certain security	3772	B
and um	3772	B
so i guess most of what happens happens in Salt Lake which is just about twenty miles south of us and that's quite a bit bigger and	3772	A
they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like LA a little bit but	3772	A
yeah it's there they- they say its getting a lot bigger uh	3772	A
oh are you so you're right familiar with all that i bet	3772	A
oh it's a what	3772	A
oh yeah	3772	A
oh at- that young huh you're kidding at which-	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah so they're getting started	3772	A
oh you're kidding	3772	A
i'll bet	3772	A
my wife was just uh talking to her mother and uh i guess they said they had an F B I come- guy come to there she she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know gang and stuff like that and	3772	A
and uh that you know it some day it'll eventually past but right now they say there's all kinds of kids getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street and that's get it's getting pretty darn scary i've got a little eighteen	3772	A
it	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
yeah that's true	3772	A
yeah i think we've probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldn't say we're anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but	3772	A
it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the the gang related things they put them_1 in jail and then they they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around L A or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but	3772	A
you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at ten eleven o'clock just roaming the streets and	3772	A
i just never remember that when you know it's been a while since i was in junior high or high school- or even elementary school but	3772	A
you just- i just you were never out past eight or nine o'clock on a school night you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and	3772	A
yeah that's true and you know and i think when it come	3772	A
pardon	3772	A
yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i	3772	A
yeah with with that with that Mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the two parent income or the two income families and and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the the values taught in the home that you used to get	3772	A
and and the kids are left to to to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i I really think that's what you're missing- we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught years ago to	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yo yeah	3772	A
i would think so yeah	3772	A
oh really	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
oh really	3772	A
huh not by their families or anything	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
sheesh	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
oh jeez	3772	A
uh-huh	3772	A
jeez	3772	A
huh	3772	A
you're kidding you know and that and it's so sad because_1 you i mean sure it's the kids doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah	3772	A
oh yeah	3772	A
the people show them_1 some interest show them_1 some love and	3772	A
yeah	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
um-hum	3772	A
okay now what is your favorite TV show	3766	A
well can't you find anything else to um to replace	3766	A
so you don't watch Northern Exposure	3766	A
oh okay you're having to be in reruns for that one have you seen Brooklyn Bridge	3766	A
that is one of it's so clean and so laid back and i'm awful tired of	3766	A
some of the things that they have on TV but this thirty minute story is i would certainly recommend that you try it	3766	A
it-	3766	A
oh okay	3766	A
well	3766	A
and i think it's a shame that our life has to be i mean so many of the tragedies that we have on the movies or on TV no we need something lighter than that have you seen um	3766	A
hm i'll Fly Away	3766	A
yes yeah	3766	A
well	3766	A
um it's not	3766	A
i don't know it it's clean it there again you don't have the violence	3766	A
and um i'm surprised it's even still on because coming at seven o'clock in the evening that's when the children want to watch	3766	A
and that is not part of it	3766	A
so um	3766	A
oh	3766	A
well i'm let's see i believe Texas lost last night is that correct	3766	A
well you don't have to	3766	A
well don't you ever forget that Oklahoma is not bad but Oklahoma	3766	A
Oklahoma State though is the better of the two so	3766	A
that's right um-hum i'm a transplanted Texan- Okie um-hum	3766	A
well we've from somewhere is correct so i hope you can find enough TV to keep you happy this winter	3766	A
well i have recently retired and i find that this is the most boring thing in the world is to sit and watch TV	3766	A
oh you don't well	3766	A
well	3766	A
it's	3766	A
oh it's nice to have the noise sometime it's nice that you don't need that noise	3766	A
do you work out of the home	3766	A
oh	3766	A
okay	3766	A
i was an accountant at the medical school here for the food service	3766	A
and it was a very heavy desk and a very busy desk and i'm awful sorry that i'm no longer gainfully employed but they're	3766	A
well it was Newhart and it's gone now and i miss it real bad	3766	B
uh yeah i think so i like the new Home Improvement sitcom i like any- i like most of the sitcoms if they keep me entertained for a half an hour	3766	B
i do watch Northern Exposure and also for for ever how many years it's been on TV i've been watching Knots Landing	3766	B
no i haven't seen that one yet	3766	B
uh	3766	B
i don't know my wife- i don't know but you know my wife watches all those Rescue 911 Unsolved Mystery things	3766	B
drives me nuts	3766	B
i just don't even like to be in the room when all of those are on it's like too much real life	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
i'll Fly Away i think i watched that that's where there there's a lawyer and he has a black nurse or a nanny	3766	B
i watched that once when it- i think when it the first episode and it just didn't grab my attention	3766	B
i felt like it was kind of they were trying to copy To Kill a Mockingbird without all the suspense or something	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
right	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
actually it's	3766	B
the best time of the year for me for watching TV is is starts around Christmas and will end in April and that's for the college basketball	3766	B
um really get involved in that my wife played basketball when she was in high school and college so that's something we can both watch and keep up with which is pretty interesting at time	3766	B
you know i'm not sure if Texas won or lost i can't i don't even keep up with them or either my uh son goes there i just don't keep up with them_1	3766	B
no my favorite teams are back east and they seem to be the best ones anyway so	3766	B
it's	3766	B
yeah well Oklahoma's doing good this year it	3766	B
yeah that where you are from Oklahoma yeah	3766	B
well aren't we all are from somewhere	3766	B
yeah	3766	B
well there's always actually i'll probably watch too much TV and and	3766	B
uh i think that probably effects me too from- just from watching too much	3766	B
so yeah well i'm at home all the time myself and uh i don't work	3766	B
and i never ever turn the TV on during the day	3766	B
uh just just something i i can't do i won't do and when someone else is here during the day and and like my son's been out of school for a month drives me nuts when he turns that thing on during the day	3766	B
well	3766	B
uh no- i have a medical problem and i don't haven't worked for three years so	3766	B
so that that just i just stay home and	3766	B
run errands do chores keep you know do the house work for my wife she still works and uh that sort of thing	3766	B
what kind of a job did you have when you were working	3766	B
yeah well	3766	B
Kathy you you know i'm i was thinking about basketball teams and um the funny thing is when i was in college at BYU i followed the school team and um	3718	A
and then when i graduated and we got married and everything i really kind of lost interest in following teams have you been following any	3718	A
oh no i know they're always having um i mean i can't believe the amount of money that the players make in the first place and i mean i know that they have a short um career and everything	3718	A
that's true it's really a lot but uh my sister always gets um season tickets to the Utah Jazz and um	3718	A
so she watches their games a lot and and everything but i don't believe we've ever been involved with any team that you know makes it to the play-offs	3718	A
too much	3718	A
uh-huh	3718	A
you did	3718	A
well i was at uh BYU when they made it to the play-offs and i think they played Notre Dame or something	3718	A
um for the big game i can't remember now that was so seems like it was eons ago it was like ten years ago i think and um i remember-	3718	A
um isn't that the one that was like the star player was Danny Ainge i think he started playing for the Boston- Boston Celtics after that	3718	A
and um and um and there was another the center	3718	A
it's been so long i can't think of anyone's name but um i i was there that year and enjoyed that game and uh but mostly like i say i haven't been following the teams and don't know who's got what record	3718	A
i haven't played uh since i broke my knee cap but um i did play in high school i was on our high school girls' team	3718	A
well i lived in Missouri and i went and i played for Parkview High School in Missouri- in Springfield Missouri and i played um a forward	3718	A
and um i enjoyed that then and that's i always loved sports do you play for your ward	3718	A
the problem that is a problem	3718	A
uh-huh	3718	A
no well i was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as opposed to professional because_1 i'd rather play than watch any thing	3718	A
and um so i'm you know like i	3718	A
well i um i have one i don't like his name- his last name was Sampson do you -remember him and he because_1 he came to Houston when i lived there and um to play for the Houston team and he was really	3718	A
i thought a bad sport and uh and i haven't followed like i say	3718	A
um-hum um-hum	3718	A
yeah that's really true but um	3718	A
well and i also don't want to spend so much of my time um memorizing statistics	3718	A
um-hum	3718	A
that's true and and you know i get i have interest in the games but i'm satisfied to watch a score in the newspaper or on you know the sports news report or something	3718	A
right rather than just like you say watch clips from the game	3718	A
no i my both my children are little they're just in kindergarten and first grade	3718	A
so no they don't play and um	3718	A
and my husband loves baseball which i don't really prefer but	3718	A
so we haven't uh haven't don't been into basketball too much but anyway	3718	A
now i can remember even what they were called um	3718	A
no i don't think so no it was the Astros the Astros were the baseball team and the Oilers Rockets yes that's it the Rockets	3718	A
yeah i uh you know we saw a game	3718	A
hi	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
not too much um who is it from the Mavericks that just wasn't there some controversy about one of their players that didn't get to play so now he doesn't he didn't get to play the whole game so now he doesn't want to play at all or something	3718	B
its crazy	3718	B
right but even so i mean i don't think i will make a million in or three million in a life time let alone a season	3718	B
yep	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah yeah we came from Oakland i went to BYU also	3718	B
yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really haven't done much with the Mavericks here	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
did you know let me think who was on that team there was a Dave Callus or a Gordon Breun remember those names	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
Celtics right right	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
right so do you play for your ward team	3718	B
oh oh	3718	B
uh-huh where did you go to high school	3718	B
oh	3718	B
uh-huh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
um i kind of stopped playing for my ward because_1 i didn't like the sportsmanship with the stake	3718	B
so i play for a Richardson City league now	3718	B
but as far as knowing anything about professional teams you know when they said to put	3718	B
right right	3718	B
right	3718	B
do you have any players that you like watching	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
it really only takes one player to really give any team a bad rap you know one that	3718	B
publicity bound you know that	3718	B
right	3718	B
yeah that's right	3718	B
you know once it gets into the finals then i i kind of root for one or the other but up until then you know	3718	B
yeah the highlights	3718	B
do you have kids that play	3718	B
yeah yeah	3718	B
oh	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
oh did you stay with now what team is it from Houston	3718	B
i wanna say Spurs but is that right	3718	B
yeah	3718	B
Rockets	3718	B
yeah	3718	B

um-hum um-hum well my i have also have a four bedroom house	3775	A
uh we have three bathrooms two upstairs and one downstairs	3775	A
which makes it nice because um it's right off the garage so when Gene's working on his cars he can come in and take a shower without going through the rest of the house	3775	A
and then um	3775	A
i have a it's in a small city of like um eight thousand people	3775	A
and i don't know if you've heard of Modesto that's the closest big city	3775	A
yeah yeah and it's on a cul-de-sac um	3775	A
which makes it nice because there's no through traffic you know about all the cars that come in here are people that just live right in here	3775	A
and uh	3775	A
yeah it makes a lot nicer space i say- i imagine you have little kids right	3775	A
oh okay well i have one also but he's he'll be thirty seven in uh February	3775	A
so but anyhow i have lots of little neighbor kids and they all love me and i just just worship them they can come in my house i have candy for them_1 and cookies for them_1	3775	A
you know so i'm just like their aunt Rosy	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
oh yeah it's	3775	A
but anyhow as far as decorating my house and everything too i've uh stenciled uh practically	3775	A
in every room in my house	3775	A
which um it looked like it would be very hard to do but it ended up being really easy and it just really just makes the rooms	3775	A
you know i stenciled right above the right below the ceiling line on the walls like- it looks something like a wallpaper border but it's actually is a stencil	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
uh-huh um-hum	3775	A
um-hum um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
well you can't afford to have it done you know plus it's fun i enjoy you know going out and working in the yard and	3775	A
you know just doing everything decorating the house up and changing it in fact i just bought a	3775	A
a large bird cage i had seen in magazines how they were decorating them that not that i want a bird i don't want a bird	3775	A
but i have decorated it up with flowers	3775	A
and i got a little nest in there that looks like it's got two little birds in there and i've got some dolls sitting in there	3775	A
it looks really really cute	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum um-hum	3775	A
yeah it's kind of fun to change too isn't it	3775	A
fudgesicle color no	3775	A
yeah it probably goes with a lot of different colors too	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
well you are the first man that i've talked to	3775	A
um-hum	3775	A
yes	3775	B
okay_1	3775	B
well it's four bedroom two bath a brick ranch house uh on a kind of a quiet dead end street next to a big wide open field	3775	B
but we're two blocks from everything you need including a small mall	3775	B
and lots of businesses within walking distance but uh	3775	B
Austin's about a million people	3775	B
so it's it's it's it's it's a nice town it's real kind of a laid back place and uh kind of an environmentally conscious city	3775	B
i've heard of it i've never been there	3775	B
yeah i like that feature about where we live that was one of the reasons we bought this house is because_1 there's only six street six houses on the on the street so	3775	B
no no not at all i have uh one kid and he's twenty- almost twenty one	3775	B
uh we still have	3775	B
there are actually no kids right in the immediate neighborhood but uh we just moved here about two years ago and we still have kids from the old neighborhood which is only a few blocks they come to visit they expect brownies	3775	B
yeah they'll they'll stay till you bake a bunch but uh	3775	B
yeah	3775	B
right	3775	B
my wife and i've never tried any stenciling uh we've always thought we she wanted to anyway	3775	B
uh somehow i feel like this particular house doesn't call for stenciling we've done some wallpapering and	3775	B
uh my wife really likes to paint different colors and things so	3775	B
do all of our own uh decorating work and repair work around the house and yard work	3775	B
sometimes it's	3775	B
oh yeah	3775	B
yeah my wife just remodeled since Christmas she's remodeled our bedroom	3775	B
with all new sheets comforters things like that and paint and she did a wallpaper border	3775	B
new drapes uh looks it's just a whole different- different atmosphere in there looks kind of like i like to hang out in there now during the daytime	3775	B
it's just	3775	B
yeah she picked a for the walls she picked a fudgesicle color	3775	B
yeah	3775	B
which well i thought well i don't know if this'll work but when she finished	3775	B
it really looked good	3775	B
yeah i don't think she meant for it to go with anything other than just fudgesicle walls and the ends the white trim	3775	B
um just to give it a little bit different look than what it's always been or been lately anyway so	3775	B
really yeah	3775	B
um i would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this category	3740	A
oh you'll talk about anything right	3740	A
uh me too what kind of books do you read	3740	A
i see	3740	A
we're gonna get along well well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as Stephen King and such	3740	A
well thank goodness believe me	3740	A
have you read The Firm	3740	A
oh that was one of the best books i've read for a long time	3740	A
and um see another one i just read that i thought was really excellent was uh Jurassic Park	3740	A
Michael Crichton or something like that have you read that one	3740	A
no it's about um this multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start a theme park and it's about dinosaurs	3740	A
well they've taken DNA material from dinosaurs and and	3740	A
really recreated dinosaurs	3740	A
and well it's a little far fetched also but um it was really an excellent book it held my interest have you read any of his other things	3740	A
Terminal Man yeah i've seen seems like i've seen the movie	3740	A
i've read a couple of Robin Cook's	3740	A
um-hum	3740	A
well i noticed he had a couple i don't know how recent they are but i think Sphere was one and something else uh another one word title and i thought i might pick up one of those books because	3740	A
Sphere S P H E R E	3740	A
well how about did you read Silence of the Lambs	3740	A
yes i did	3740	A
they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was i- i could not put the book down i	3740	A
you're kidding	3740	A
oh yes	3740	A
i see	3740	A
the movie was wonderful you didn't see it	3740	A
well true it didn't have the impact but i thought that they stayed- uh they stayed very faithful to the book	3740	A
well	3740	A
it's hard to top that book	3740	A
oh really what's it about have you another serial killer	3740	A
oh	3740	A
Two Minute Warning	3740	A
you know i think you're right i think i	3740	A
i'll have to look back and see what else he's written because he	3740	A
really	3740	A
okay	3740	B
but i- i also picked gardening and i mean i tried to talk about that for five minutes i don't really garden very much but books i could talk about you know forever i	3740	B
well mostly fiction and um i- i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories	3740	B
see and um	3740	B
oh you too	3740	B
i	3740	B
yeah well i like uh i- i like a book i could	3740	B
in some way relate to and and that's i don't know it's so off the wall most of that stuff you know you really- i you can't really believe it- i mean you it's hard to to to read it and and really think that this could really happen it's it's i don't know it's not	3740	B
believable to me at all	3740	B
well well that's true i mean you don't have to read a book and believe that you know stuff can happen but i don't know i guess i just go more for realism	3740	B
oh yeah it's very good	3740	B
yeah	3740	B
yeah that was good i read that oh quite a while ago	3740	B
oh by um oh Crichton right Crichton now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing	3740	B
oh	3740	B
uh-huh	3740	B
yeah yeah	3740	B
yes i have but i Terminal Man was that- was that one of his	3740	B
he- he writes stuff his writing- books are similar to Robin Cook's have you read any Robin Cook	3740	B
yeah and they're sort of similar you know the in the you know he deals a lot in you know scientific stuff or you know stuff that um	3740	B
you don't know whether could it could happen or not you know it's just um	3740	B
you know but i mean most of it is good i uh haven't uh i haven't read anything by him in a long time	3740	B
Fear is that what you said Fear	3740	B
oh oh no i don't know i'm not familiar with that no	3740	B
oh oh yes oh yes- you- did you read his other one The Red Dragon yes now uh both of them were terrific	3740	B
well see now i couldn't either now i uh a friend of mine started to read it because_1 you know i told her it's terrific and everybody she'd spoke to said it was terrific she couldn't get into it	3740	B
well she's sort of a lightweight anyway you know her her uh her reading consists of uh have you ever heard of V C Andrews	3740	B
yeah you know stuff like that you know Danielle Steele you know you know stuff like that so she really she couldn't get into this but she i think she said she saw the movie she liked the movie i don't you know	3740	B
yeah the movie was good but i well you know compared to the book right no	3740	B
well they did but um i don't think it was as scary as i expected it to be i- i really you know	3740	B
i- i don't know i just didn't think it was as suspenseful as as	3740	B
i expected it to be i don't know but it was a good it was a good movie	3740	B
yeah well that's true and i'm waiting his new one comes out sometime in the spring i think	3740	B
yes	3740	B
uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well this- this'll be i think his fourth or fifth book	3740	B
and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black Sunday which was a about the uh bombing in the in the Superdome oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that	3740	B
um gee i don't know i think it was called Black Sunday it was about fifteen- well no about ten years ago i guess it uh you know	3740	B
but um	3740	B
that's all he's written Red Dragon that one and uh Silence of the	3740	B
um well i'm glad i got a male because i'm gonna need some help um i haven't really given any dinner parties but um	3715	A
so um maybe you could help me out here in this sense and i keep i keep asking him you know what what what do you think we ought to have you know but i was thinking of like you one of those subway sandwiches those long subway sandwiches and maybe uh	3715	A
um a pasta salad and some chips and some beer and some Coke and um i thought a cake and he said no and so we're just going back and forth so	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
yeah yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah he's i don't really think men care do they	3715	A
yeah that's what he said	3715	A
right	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah yeah so that oh okay i'll guess i'll do something like that but um	3715	A
oh really	3715	A
okay what is that	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
uh-huh	3715	A
oh really is this an artichoke dip because_1 a friend of mine had that at at one of her parties and it was really good but when she told me it was artichoke dip i was going oh no	3715	A
as i'm not much of a fan for artichoke-	3715	A
that one see i thought that was something else	3715	A
huh	3715	A
huh	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
yeah that's a party- it sounds like the same thing my friend served and it was really good but when she told me it had artichokes in i thought oh God	3715	A
yeah uh-huh it was	3715	A
well my husband loved it yeah he really did	3715	A
oh really huh	3715	A
yeah okay yeah and he wanted uh uh some uh chili dip that i usually make too so	3715	A
oh yeah	3715	A
yeah	3715	A
and no women and children allowed and i	3715	A
yeah i guess so well um let me see we went to a Christmas party and uh a friend of mine had this and it was she had the she was the one that had that dip	3715	A
and another thing that my husband really liked that i and i liked too that i would have never thought of serving and it was really easy	3715	A
um and it sounds- it doesn't sound good but when you all put when you put it together and you taste it it's real- excellent it's um the Mexicorn and	3715	A
and corn chips you mix all that together with a bottle of the Catalina dressing and you and you just mix it all together and you serve it like that and it is really good	3715	A
well i	3715	B
you you could probably probably get uh the sub might work	3715	B
uh the beer will definitely work a lot of that	3715	B
and uh chips and dips will probably work	3715	B
uh not really to be honest with you i mean i i've never i've never really cared i just like little munchies and stuff basically you know just dip chips and dip usually do it if there's enough of it	3715	B
but	3715	B
males usually aren't into meals you know like more than- and not as much as women you know like just sitting around and eat the finger sandwiches and stuff	3715	B
and but uh i've always- i've always you know just had chips dip and beer and just gone for it from there	3715	B
i got a i got a good dip	3715	B
yeah i- i stole it from a restaurant	3715	B
it is uh you get a can of can of uh chopped spinach	3715	B
and you get uh fresh Parmesan Cheese	3715	B
and you get uh uh artichoke hearts	3715	B
okay you get uh a whole can of artichoke hearts	3715	B
you take about out of the i tell you out of the it's about a four ounce can of spinach out of that you take about an ounce and a half to two ounces of spinach	3715	B
okay you stick all of it in a food processor	3715	B
okay you need to get uh	3715	B
and you grind- mix it up real good it's almost pureed	3715	B
to a degree and you heat that up	3715	B
and you take uh i'd say approximately eight ounces of the fresh Parmesan Cheese and you uh put it in there while it's heating up	3715	B
and you mix it up	3715	B
and this is a recipe from Houston's restaurant	3715	B
that i stole yeah	3715	B
yeah	3715	B
yeah this is artichokes spinach and parmesan cheese and that's all that's in there	3715	B
oh i'm sorry and heavy it has heavy cream in it too	3715	B
i forgot forgot about that	3715	B
it has heavy cream in there i- i- i just i fling it every time i do it i	3715	B
mean i don't have anything written down i just kind of know it from i just go by taste and texture	3715	B
i've never really written it down but they never give me any specs on it i've just kind of	3715	B
had a variance of it you know every time i go in and it gets pretty close you've just got to watch how much spinach you put in there you've got to put it a little bit at a time it should be a uh	3715	B
uh uh like- about a guacamole- lighter than a guacamole color	3715	B
yeah and it's served	3715	B
yeah and it's served hot	3715	B
it's served hot	3715	B
it yeah and it's real good i don't know if they'd go for that or not but it's just a real good dip	3715	B
yeah it's a fancy- i think in Houston's it's called a Chicago dip	3715	B
yeah	3715	B
if you ever go there try it that's the stuff	3715	B
chili is usually guys usually go for chili now that you now that you mention it	3715	B
probably go for chili and beer that's always a good gas burner	3715	B
that's right	3715	B
plenty- plenty of ceiling fans going	3715	B
uh-huh	3715	B
right	3715	B
huh	3715	B
so national health care i don't know about you but for me i am voting for the next democrat for the president uh that says he's going to do something about a national health care program	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
yeah i myself uh	3748	A
i haven't worked for three years because of some medical problems and uh if i had not had insurance	3748	A
with the company i worked with at the time i believe i would have died and that worries me thinking cause i know a lot of people that don't have any coverage at all	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
well i i think that paying for it on your own it is like in my case i am up to about two hundred thousand dollars worth of health care i don't think that would have been possible for the majority of the people in this world	3748	A
so but then again there is uh the high cost of medical care is out unreal	3748	A
uh-huh	3748	A
well i think somewhere along the line whatever plan they come up with it is going to have to keep the doctors in a high paying field	3748	A
uh i myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more years and uh he is doing it for the money	3748	A
so	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked out for the people that can't afford it	3748	A
right	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
i found out yeah i uh my mother is on Medicare Medicaid whatever and uh i know it doesn't pay all of her medical- hospital bills and so forth	3748	A
and i think it is kind of a shame that at this point in her life she still has to pay quite a bit whenever she is in the hospital several thousand for you know for a weeks stay if she ends up having to pay	3748	A
uh-huh	3748	A
i know one uh not this Christmas but the Christmas before she was out here and we were out at Smithville which is a little town out east of here and	3748	A
we had to take her to the hospital on a Sunday afternoon for a back problem uh fairly minor she just strained it sprained it but	3748	A
when the bills starting coming in she had already gone home so i got a chance to look at them and i was shocked i mean i had been through a lot	3748	A
i mean with medical bills but when i saw what they did to her that day and it cost about three thousand dollars just to uh get a prescription for some pain pills basically	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
well that doesn't happen i	3748	A
it is weird i was in the hospital for like eight days back in October uh so many mistakes were made during my time there that i uh literally left the hospital in a taxi cab	3748	A
just to get away from the place i was scared as to what they were going to do to me next	3748	A
and when i got the bill it was outrageous uh pills that i had never heard of that i had taken which i know that i didn't i mean i wasn't ill i was just in for some routine stuff and it goes on and on	3748	A
yeah	3748	A
right	3748	A
i think Kerrey is and i think also Jerry Brown from California are interested uh actually the way Bush has been going the last few weeks i think he may be interested uh he he seem to be	3748	A
yeah uh	3748	A
yeah up until just recently i i would have thought Bush would uh you know i still he has done a pretty good job	3748	A
yeah i uh i basically agree uh i have	3748	B
mixed feelings i guess there are some uh	3748	B
somehow there needs to be some controls on the rising costs of of health care	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah if you if you don't have a very good paying job or you are not with a company that provides it it is uh pretty much unaffordable uh to pay for it on your own	3748	B
yeah that is right	3748	B
yeah i have a friend who uh uh is from uh lived at lived in London or lived in London and he lives here now where they do have medical- uh health care uh there and i guess	3748	B
i guess there is some disadvantages too i guess uh uh because of that they there has been a great uh	3748	B
migration of of doctors from there over to more lucrative practices and sometimes i guess it does effect the quality of health care somewhat so	3748	B
i-	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah yeah they don't have i think they don't get into it for any other reason	3748	B
um	3748	B
yes uh i uh agree too and also the uh the elderly a lot of times when they uh reach retirement uh	3748	B
they can't afford any any supplemental insurance beyond what is provided through Medicare and Medicaid and sometimes that is not enough to to cover the costs	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah particularly for people who are on uh on on just living mostly on social security or something like that they don't have enough extra money to pay for that	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah yeah	3748	B
uh in i guess in addition to uh uh national health care policy there uh there has to be some sort of	3748	B
monitoring i guess too of the overall medical field and hospital costs and and	3748	B
uh	3748	B
yeah yeah	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
yeah i am afraid right now there is a lot of i guess you would have to call it just basic fraud in the in in the business cause they know they can turn a lot of these things in and they are not uh questioned at all	3748	B
uh i don't know which one of the uh democratic candidates either either Kerrey or Clinton i guess one of those two i can't remember which is pretty much in favor of some sort of	3748	B
yeah	3748	B
well he's he's probably campaigning i don't know how serious he is but	3748	B
well Nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um yeah i agree i also think that there are more um the people are women stay single longer it seems like	3743	A
yeah i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty two so	3743	A
you know um i know that	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
yeah yeah seems like there uh-huh go ahead	3743	A
oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too i mean that's there're a lot of	3743	A
either divorced or um	3743	A
you know never been married so	3743	A
yeah i agree	3743	A
well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
uh-huh	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah and it really it's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um	3743	A
i mean i i don't blame anybody when they have to work because_1 um yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah well what do you think's gonna happen in the next generation you think it'll continue yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah	3743	A
um-hum	3743	A
yeah it is i think some	3743	A
i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children i guess i see that happening already	3743	A
some choosing it and and they get you know there're people chide them_1 for it you know why aren't you out	3743	A
well of course working	3743	B
including me well what do you think it is	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yes they do yeah they do	3743	B
right	3743	B
uh-huh yeah	3743	B
yeah that's true it's a big change i'm an OB nurse and so i really do see what you're saying there	3743	B
it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients' ages	3743	B
and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young so yeah you're right there's a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties	3743	B
so that's true but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers	3743	B
if they didn't have if they weren't out there working and having their careers	3743	B
they probably would be married and having their children so i guess it's a combination	3743	B
no go on	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of mixed up families that's for sure yeah	3743	B
well just that i think the families	3743	B
the the role in the family and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children	3743	B
um we do it all i really think that and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers	3743	B
have the major role i really do i think they're just	3743	B
they're not doing very much less i don't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides	3743	B
i think that we're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves	3743	B
oh it is	3743	B
yeah	3743	B
yeah it's it's difficult and i think that i live in Plano actually so	3743	B
it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better	3743	B
and i really hate that you know i hate to see that and- and i've been here for a very long time	3743	B
but um	3743	B
i don't know now i'm a single parent and i don't have a choice anymore but	3743	B
i used to just work occasionally for extra money but now i have to work all the time and that's really hard and and i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and	3743	B
and leave the kids in a way it's good it's very good to get out with adults and i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and	3743	B
and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's	3743	B
not very smart i think that's difficult on them_1 so	3743	B
well it's gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but i'm not sure how it's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford	3743	B
to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it	3743	B
and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards	3743	B
but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it	3743	B
and they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families it's hard to say	3743	B
uh-huh	3743	B
uh so what do you like best about golf	3779	A
really	3779	A
really	3779	A
yeah i play uh i play probably four or five times a week my my wife and kids	3779	A
don't like it too much but	3779	A
it's such a great game i- i- i play three- you know thirty six holes after work	3779	A
and then uh	3779	A
yeah it does in the summertime in the winter it's too you know but uh you know i go to the indoor driving range all all winter and uh	3779	A
and uh i practice putting and it's it's a fun game	3779	A
oh really	3779	A
that sounds great	3779	A
well i have to do that because i love golf and	3779	A
well	3779	A
Cathy is that your name Cathy um	3779	A
do you-	3779	A
do you uh	3779	A
do you have a favorite golfer	3779	A
professional golfer excuse me my wife is making fun of me	3779	A
yeah she hates it when i you know she thinks it's funny that i got golf as a topic because_1 you know she dislikes it so much so	3779	A
yeah	3779	A
Greg Norman why	3779	A
are you sure you're not attracted to him or anything	3779	A
uh-huh	3779	A
yeah yeah i like Tom he's good	3779	A
yeah i'll agree with you there Cathy	3779	A
yeah he does	3779	A
uh i'd have to say uh	3779	A
i- i still like the Golden Bear you know	3779	A
oh yeah i- i like the senior tour i- i think it's got more personality	3779	A
you know and the names don't change every week you know	3779	A
so	3779	A
sure	3779	A
sure	3779	A
really	3779	A
my kids	3779	A
do you have kids Cathy	3779	A
i'm starting them off young i'm gonna get them oh you got a boy good	3779	A
he does has he got a pretty good stance	3779	A
huh	3779	A
oh	3779	A
huh	3779	A
well that's true	3779	A
that's true he's out getting some sunshine anyway	3779	A
i like to watch golf my husband plays golf and i've i've really become	3779	B
fairly acquainted with the game it's pretty interesting to watch i think my favorite part of the game is the putting part	3779	B
uh-huh do you play	3779	B
oh my	3779	B
well i've already	3779	B
good heavens	3779	B
it must stay light out there pretty well	3779	B
in the summer- well yeah in the summer uh-huh	3779	B
um-hum	3779	B
there's a place here in Dallas it's called Dave and Buster's	3779	B
and they have a laser well it's like lasers golf game	3779	B
where there's three beams and you take your clubs and you hit the ball and they give you a screen of what you would be seeing from where you lie	3779	B
it's really a lot of fun and it's it's fairly comparable to some of the nicer golf courses around here the nicer public courses the price of it is	3779	B
if you're ever in Dallas you'd have to go to Dave and Buster's	3779	B
it is a very fine game i think it teaches a lot of goodness- a lot of good um	3779	B
attributes	3779	B
to people	3779	B
yeah you got it right	3779	B
do i have a favorite golfer	3779	B
oh talking about golf on the T I thing	3779	B
uh when you start up on golf	3779	B
well you probably picked it though on your list of of topics to speak about	3779	B
um i would say that my favorite golfer is Greg Norman	3779	B
there's just something about the way he plays golf he just approaches the ball	3779	B
so confidently	3779	B
and the way he hits he's just really he's got kind of a funny swing but beyond that he's really he seems a very confident player and he does	3779	B
he does play fairly well	3779	B
what about yourself-	3779	B
well that may be too he's he's not the most attractive guy on the on the tour i'll say that but uh	3779	B
i guess after watching	3779	B
for so long for so long i've been i've been watching and hearing about golf from my husband for	3779	B
six years six and a half years or a little more	3779	B
and after a while you get to where yeah you start watching who plays well and who doesn't i think Tom Kite is another good player	3779	B
he's got a real ugly stance but	3779	B
he does he he does play real well and he he seems to almost always win	3779	B
so he's so that's got to say a lot for him right there that he just wins quite often	3779	B
what about yourself who is your favorite player	3779	B
even on the even on the senior tour	3779	B
well yeah well the guys have	3779	B
the there's one thing that's true yeah you can always count on Lee and Chichi and Don January and	3779	B
and uh oh yeah the Golden Bear out there hitting them_1 up	3779	B
putting them_1 in	3779	B
uh-huh yeah i have a young boy	3779	B
uh-huh oh he already plays golf he's not eighteen months and he golfs around the house	3779	B
uh-huh	3779	B
no he's horrible but but he loves	3779	B
to he's got a a set of three little plastic clubs and little plastic balls and he takes his club and he whacks the ball around the house and he whacks the cat and then he'll get a big play ball and bounce it around with his club	3779	B
but he really enjoys taking them out and he likes to watch his daddy practice swing and putt around the house so	3779	B
yeah i'm i'm already a golf widow and i don't mind it i mean i know where my husband is when he's out	3779	B
and he's in a very wholesome environment while he's out there so	3779	B
yeah	3779	B
it's	3779	B
yeah i've been with i was with uh TI for uh thirty four years so obviously i found something worth worth doing there and have prejudices about uh what i want	3786	B
yeah uh where do you work	3786	B
oh	3786	B
yeah they uh	3786	B
i'm not sure what the category's supposed to be uh but it was what	3786	B
something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company	3786	B
uh	3786	B
other other than salary didn't it say yeah	3786	B
well i'm i thought it said other than salary but yeah	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with Chance-Vought before i joined uh	3786	B
there and ironically i left Chance-Vought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some	3786	B
thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company	3786	B
and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh	3786	B
then it became Dallas County's largest employer oh	3786	B
but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh	3786	B
wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job	3786	B
yeah	3786	B
well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh	3786	B
heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time	3786	B
and it's amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them	3786	B
uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing	3786	B
and power and they they just couldn't understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others	3786	B
uh including IBM's that in the technical community salary was never first it was usually about third and yeah	3786	B
right	3786	B
right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort	3786	B
uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes was the salary	3786	B
and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the	3786	B
oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you know because- because_1 they just couldn't believe that that people weren't motivated by money	3786	B
yeah well i'm sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but	3786	B
in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could get- you could get a job elsewhere anytime- any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh	3786	B
in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing	3786	B
-hello okay so you were with TI huh	3786	A
well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right	3786	A
i uh work for myself i sell uh metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh uh	3786	A
oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i can't really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time	3786	A
and uh i think most people don't necessarily realize the cost of them_1 and they're somewhat probably getting out of hand	3786	A
well	3786	A
i think uh	3786	A
oh the way i got-	3786	A
right well no it didn't necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess	3786	A
such as	3786	A
well i i imagine that's what they're referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh	3786	A
and they grew up around you didn't it	3786	A
uh-huh	3786	A
yeah	3786	A
um-hum	3786	A
right right	3786	A
well i think as long as it's comparable with you know the job or can	3786	A
that uh you aren't being picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i	3786	A
yes yes	3786	A
well-	3786	A
right	3786	A
well i i wouldn't say they aren't motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are	3786	A
equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh	3786	A
yes	3786	A
right	3786	A
right	3786	A
oh okay	3771	B
um well you're in quite a um interesting city for um crime drugs and all kinds of things that we hear about aren't you	3771	B
oh i see uh-huh	3771	B
uh-huh i see	3771	B
um	3771	B
yeah	3771	B
well it's probably- each city i guess has its own specific type of difficulty	3771	B
oh there's a lot of homicides in Dallas that seems to be	3771	B
uh well a lot of it is drug related but i- i think that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms bearing uh you know personal arms bearing	3771	B
uh and it it seems to just lend itself to instantaneous um if you're don't feel good about a certain thing there you go and the crime is committed so uh	3771	B
um	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
oh i see um-hum	3771	B
i'm not sure i know sufficiently about the ins and outs of the law to um	3771	B
know exactly what that brings about you know the the appeals and things like that as far as the people being um retrialed and maybe get an alleviated sentence	3771	B
it does seem though that the jail capacities are stretching to the fullest and uh	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
oh	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
um-hum that's right	3771	B
um	3771	B
uh-huh	3771	B
that's right i believe that	3771	B
um-hum um-hum	3771	B
oh my in the parking lot oh yes uh-huh um	3771	B
um	3771	B
it's very difficult to know what the answer is and uh along with that there's a lot of poverty- poverty a lot of homeless and	3771	B
and a lot of um i guess um discrimination is still around and	3771	B
i- i suppose until somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things people are just going to take an extreme uh measure and um uh protect themselves in one way or the other	3771	B
um-hum	3771	B
uh-huh	3771	B
oh	3771	B
oh i didn't know that	3771	B
oh that's very strange	3771	B
because uh discuss crime in America and what we might be able- uh do to uh help stop it	3771	A
oh yeah well actually i- i- i live in Houston i'm in Miami on business	3771	A
uh but i've i've been down here quite a bit for the past oh six months on and off	3771	A
and yes there is plenty of crime in Miami uh but you know um i don't know that it's any worse than Houston	3771	A
and i know there's plenty of crime in Dallas too	3771	A
yeah	3771	A
yeah i have uh i was talking with some with- with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the United States but i'm almost of the opinion	3771	A
that the only way that a change is going to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh	3771	A
have a a swift and and sure justice that uh you know do away with some of these automatic uh appeals when uh i think that guilt is proven	3771	A
well in in Houston it's absurd they are letting uh uh people that have been convicted three times for armed robbery	3771	A
for example and this was they had a big article in the Houston newspaper about it	3771	A
because of the overcrowding they're being released from Huntsville they're given two hundred dollars and put on a bus for Houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer	3771	A
less than twenty percent or twenty- ten percent it was a ridiculously low low number actually do ever report to a parole- parole officer	3771	A
and the vast majority of them_1 are then caught again go through the courts back to jail well it's ludicrous and absurd	3771	A
and i- i just don't think that you know we as a society can afford to continue to have these people that are repeat offenders being paroled after serving	3771	A
a a fraction sometimes you know a quarter of their sentence	3771	A
but uh i- i don't know it's uh i don't own a gun	3771	A
and uh i you know i believe and i adhere to the thought that	3771	A
you know if you so often i mean it's it's having a gun leads to tragedy	3771	A
and at the same and at the same time	3771	A
i think i have thought before what would i do if i were accosted	3771	A
you know	3771	A
a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in Houston and was robbed	3771	A
broad open daylight in the parking lot	3771	A
so anyway it it is it's a scary situation and i really don't know what this what the answer	3771	A
yeah i've i'm i'm a firm believer though that uh our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence	3771	A
uh and- and knowing that the parole uh will come uh uh just in a short matter of time not only that we have people in jail now that i mean if had a program on Sixty Minutes i mean that they have telephones	3771	A
in their jail cells it's absurd	3771	A
yeah so i mean i don't know	3771	A
yeah i don't know it's yeah	3771	A
oh yeah i got three how about_1 yourself	3727	A
oh you've got uh young children then	3727	A
oh my goodness that's great	3727	A
what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or	3727	A
two boys	3727	A

i don't blame you well-	3727	A
well	3727	A
well we got two boys and a girl also- well we got two boys and a girl well uh	3727	A
yes yes so maybe- maybe maybe you'll get lucky and get a girl this time	3727	A
well our boys one is uh	3727	A

kind of	3727	A
well it's a program for	3727	A

i got a brother-in-law just got back from a trip to Alaska	3731	B
and uh he said that was quite a bit of fun uh i guess the salmon are pretty good fighters and uh they went uh out in the you know more of the deep sea fishing as well caught a fair amount of halibut	3731	B
and they say the halibut are are a pretty good fighter too	3731	B
they're an odd fish i don't know if you ever seen- i guess they lie on the flat on the bottom of the ocean and they only have one eye or or just a small eye on the other side	3731	B
as halibut	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
do they put up a fight or not	3731	B
once you get them over- to over to the side of the boat because_1 they're they're pretty pretty weighty fish are they yeah do you net those or i guess you have to huh	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
yeah	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
you know i've never eaten catfish are they good eating	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
is that right	3731	B
kind of an ugly looking fish are they great big whiskers on them_1	3731	B
uh-huh	3731	B
oh yeah	3731	B
taste a little better yeah well these trout that we catch are real good i- i quite enjoy those uh they this place where we go with uh with my six year old they uh filet them for you right there for only like ten cents a fish i mean it's well worth it	3731	B
so you just fry them up right	3731	B
okay uh	3731	A
what kind of fishing is there up in Utah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
well i was i was raised on Alabama coast and i like salt water fishing	3731	A
and Dallas is there's quite a few lakes around here i've	3731	A
done some fishing from the shore i don't have a boat which you really need to get out into the lakes uh you know really do any good	3731	A
i've	3731	A
i've caught a few striped bass from the shore some of the small ones	3731	A
and then catfish and stuff i haven't done a lot since i moved to Dallas	3731	A
oh	3731	A
off and on for ten years we were here	3731	A
six years and my wife got homesick we moved backed to Alabama Mobile spent about eight months and moved back to Dallas because_1 the	3731	A
wages and all were better up here	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
right	3731	A
yeah i did that a couple of times the company i had worked for in Mobile they had a	3731	A
couple of bunch of us guys got together and we and chartered a boat and	3731	A
went out caught red snapper and one guy caught a ling	3731	A
and i caught a few what they call trigger fish	3731	A
but the it wasn't	3731	A
yeah and we'd constantly getting our lines tangled up with people- people fishing on both sides of the boat so	3731	A
it was one uh fish were good but it was kind of a hassle	3731	A
um	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
um	3731	A
okay well we we catch flounder on the coast which is about the same thing	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
uh well they hug the bottom they	3731	A
they don't run that much but they they	3731	A
somehow they hug the bottom and it's kind of you find- it's a pretty good struggle to put them_1 in you know pull them_1 in once they get	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
uh	3731	A
i've caught i've caught one on a hook with live shrimp i've	3731	A
caught several of them_1 in cast nets	3731	A
yeah about yeah you would have to net them_1 to get them_1 in the boat because_1 they really have a small mouth and all	3731	A
but i've i've fished mostly you know	3731	A
when i was on the coast in the in the bays and stuff in a little you know plywood skiff	3731	A
and	3731	A
well the water's kind of brackish so i	3731	A
i catch a mixture of salt water and fresh water fish right with	3731	A
right on the coast you know i catch	3731	A
catfish in the bayou and go	3731	A
a half a mile and catch a you know salt water fish	3731	A
yeah they they real good they	3731	A
and so that i guess	3731	A
you know people on the coast and all consider them that's the best around	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah they they	3731	A
yeah they are and they're bottom feeders if you	3731	A
if you get them_1 out of real muddy water then they got a muddy taste to them_1 but if you	3731	A
you know catch them_1 out of clear running water they they're pretty good	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
yeah	3731	A
what kind of hobbies do you find yourself involved with	3733	A
huh	3733	A
yes	3733	A
ah uh woodworking um very little actually uh	3733	A
no um	3733	A
oh no they- they uh they they suggested a variety of possibilities and of whatever hobbies- hobbies you can come up with uh no uh	3733	A
my hobbies kind of vary from time to time depending on what kind of time i've got uh i spent twenty years as an auto mechanic	3733	A
and i i enjoy working with with cars uh i've built a couple of race cars uh	3733	A
uh yeah um	3733	A
also- i do enjoy woodworking- uh	3733	A
uh cabinet cabinetry type woodworking	3733	A
um	3733	A
i've done some model building and	3733	A
different things like that um	3733	A
right now hobbies pretty much tend to be on hold	3733	A
with a twelve week old baby and	3733	A
full time student hobbies are a extreme luxury	3733	A
you say- you say you uh sing with a group in a community college	3733	A
what sort of music do you work with	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
yes	3733	A
that sounds like a lot of fun	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
those are usually the best sorts	3733	A
i you you say show music like Broadway musical type show music	3733	A
okay	3733	A
hum	3733	A
-those are wonderful shows	3733	A
oh yeah yeah	3733	A
yeah well the the chances are these are all all things they're very familiar with and just the chance to have some entertainment and some some variety in their life	3733	A
at- at retirement homes i mean even still there are variety there- there're a lot of	3733	A
retirement homes that try to make it sound like it's a real you know luxury condominium setup but- still the you know the bulk of the people living there tend to be living pretty restricted lives	3733	A
so something like that can be a lot of fun	3733	A
um-hum	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
yeah	3733	A
uh-huh	3733	A
oh yeah	3733	A
oh that sounds	3733	A
well i find myself involved in um singing with a group at the local community college	3733	B
and also embroidering and especially cooking i like to uh cook and uh have been in charge of various events	3733	B
and sometimes i embroider when i have really a bit of spare time	3733	B
now it seems you're interested in woodworking	3733	B
what kind of woodworking do you do	3733	B
uh oh	3733	B
i thought that's what they said um-hum	3733	B
oh i see um-hum	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
i see	3733	B
um-hum um-hum	3733	B
oh you have	3733	B
oh my	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
yeah	3733	B
oh my uh-huh	3733	B
uh-huh	3733	B
uh yes um	3733	B
well we we work with show music and with uh opera arias and actually we're very fortunate to have a um	3733	B
former opera singer uh from New York who is relocated to	3733	B
Dallas and uh she has taken over the the vocal music department at one of the community colleges here in Dallas and uh she both gives private lessons and has um	3733	B
a variety of classes especially on Saturdays for um people that are interested and what i found- i've been going over there for about three or four years now	3733	B
and what we found is that there winds up being a core group of us that um keep on coming back	3733	B
and uh we give performances at the college and at the uh Botanical Gardens in the spring time and at various retirement homes and things of that nature	3733	B
and you can um select whatever things you want to work on for the semester and she'll help you with them and give you um lots of good points and uh it it's a very	3733	B
enjoyable group uh it's not um overly formal that you have to worry it's not professional but it's good and i enjoy it very much	3733	B
yeah uh-huh	3733	B
right uh-huh i've i've personally done some things from Camelot and from My Fair Lady you know things like that um	3733	B
uh and uh some of the people really are just very	3733	B
fine singers we kind of enjoy one another	3733	B
so uh and and when we go out to those retirement homes or the nursing homes	3733	B
the people are very very appreciative which also makes you very happy that you're able to kind of pick up somebody else's life also so	3733	B
right um-hum	3733	B
yes	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
oh yes	3733	B
um-hum	3733	B
yeah	3733	B
i i really uh that's really what we have found and also um a lot of the people are very knowledgeable	3733	B
uh in in the field of music they're just very knowledgeable about a lot of things and they'll come and talk to you afterwards and um	3733	B
you better know your onions but uh it it is something i do enjoy very much so and the other thing i like to do is	3733	B
uh cook i have um uh	3733	B
uh planned uh menus for various organizations and this year i was asked to take care of uh several luncheons and dinners up at my children's school	3733	B
and the next thing that we're getting ready for is a big faculty luncheon and we're gonna give them Italian food	3733	B
really	3729	B
you know i just did last week as a matter of fact um i'm wondering if their subject is more uh products by mail or things that you buy at the store but um	3729	B
i bought something through the mail through a merchant through a company that's generally got pretty good products and	3729	B
i was really impressed with the way they handled the return policy they sent UPS to our door to pick it up free of charge which is such a an unusual always have to go to the	3729	B
post office or some place to return it usually	3729	B
it was Hannah Anderson the children's um clothing	3729	B
do they	3729	B
it really is	3729	B
it took a while because it was the holiday weeks um	3729	B
it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive we're we're fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but	3729	B
it would've probably been an inconvenience if if it had been a home pickup and and we hadn't been here but they were also willing to pick up at work	3729	B
it was defective we returned it for the same thing um in a little larger size but it seemed that it was stitched uh around the collar such that the second time she wore it it uh it ripped	3729	B
and and i think that's unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that um	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
yeah	3729	B
exactly yeah and it it's unfortunate you really cannot depend on the the department store's name for that necessarily i don't know if you have Nordstroms in Dallas	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably carry- carry overall pretty good merchandise you you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store	3729	B
yeah surprisingly	3729	B
no	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
um you know i don't know that i bet they probably do but i i'm not sure that i've	3729	B
associated some of what i've seen as lines that they always carry as their own brand or just something that they've um gotten at a at a lower uh price because it's a large volume some of their children's lines	3729	B
i tend to look there for kids' things because they don't they they sometimes have things that you can't find elsewhere because_1 they have a pretty large variety but not often for myself	3729	B
not that much actually i used to i think before i had a child and because you end up paying for the shipping and handling and everything um	3729	B
and you don't always have the convenience of returning it if it's not right uh i- i tend less often to do that today than i might've ten years ago	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
exactly	3729	B
um-hum um-hum	3729	B
um-hum	3729	B
whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider it you	3729	B
you find that it's a lot more inconvenient to have to arrange for returning it if it's by mail	3729	B
yeah it is funny you know i'm also amazed at uh	3729	B
that i read about those i don't know anybody who does this but that people buy clothes and wear them and then think that they can return them	3729	B
that's what	3729	B
uh-huh was this Spiegel by any chance	3729	A
don't know that one i know Spiegel does that and yes and uh to me that's very impressive to think that	3729	A
but well and did you have any problem obviously had no problem with returning it	3729	A
oh well	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
did	3729	A
did you return it because it was defective or because you just didn't like it	3729	A
huh	3729	A
well i know what you mean because a couple years ago i remember i was in one of the nicer department stores and looking at it was one of the designer T-shirts or some sort of thing like that and the thing	3729	A
it was very expensive you know as they always are and it was a piece of junk you know stitching was terrible i think that they were trying to just you know play on a name	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
no we don't i've been to one of the Nordstroms in um uh New York	3729	A
nice store	3729	A
do you really	3729	A
do you have Lord and Taylor there	3729	A
um uh we're originally from Saint Louis and we came down to Dallas and they have Lord and Taylors here and i look at a lot of their house brands and i am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands in some of the stores	3729	A
does Nordstroms carry their own house brand	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
do you shop by mail quite a bit	3729	A
it's not as inexpensive-	3729	A
um-hum	3729	A
that's the only problem that i see because uh my sister gets tons of catalogs and passes them on to me and i look at things and they have some gorgeous clothes but the problem is that	3729	A
you can't always go by sizes you know you'll go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different manufacturers and they all fit you know differently but uh that's the main thing is that i can't tell	3729	A
whether the thing is going to fit or not	3729	A
and so i tend not to mail order	3729	A
but	3729	A
i-	3729	A
well personally i always try on before i buy anyway i just it amazes me when i talk to people that they buy like they buy a bunch of clothes and they don't try anything on they take them home	3729	A
oh okay well that's a different story right	3729	A
i hear about that too and that just appalls me i mean that's stealing really	3729	A
my name is Ferrell	3752	B
where are you calling from	3752	B
Miami i'm in Utah	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
yes it is definitely	3752	B
sure go ahead	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
i uh have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years	3752	B
and uh i'm almost convinced there's a lot of it has to do with environment uh	3752	B
she taught in a poor area poor area here in Utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the S A T scores	3752	B
in all the districts of the state	3752	B
and uh	3752	B
the district we're presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from from home	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah well you know you see these documentaries on uh on Japan for example and the uh rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week	3752	B
uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do	3752	B
now we have that to a to a degree here that's only because we have a little bit of a of a problem that's i guess peculiar to Utah and we have a a high population of young young people	3752	B
young children one of the larger uh uh student teacher ratios you know average class size is probably thirty five or something like that	3752	B
and that poses another problem where the you know just the individual attention that's needed sometimes uh is lacking because of the you know the shear numbers of it and what they've gone to is a year round program here where	3752	B
uh in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round	3752	B
but you have uh you go like for uh eleven weeks and you're off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these these four periods rather than than the classic summer vacation	3752	B
these are just mostly the elementary grades however	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
oh	3752	B
regardless of where they live huh	3752	B
oh	3752	B
oh that's that's interesting it's kind of like uh turning it over to the private sector to some degree	3752	B
and the the supply and demand works yeah	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
that's an interesting concept	3752	B
yeah yeah i i the stories you read about the competency and the literacy of the high school graduates for example	3752	B
i can't believe it you	3752	B
uh-huh	3752	B
yeah their their awareness of the of the uh current events and geography like you were mentioned early	3752	B
uh uh i just find it	3752	B
are you ready-	3752	A
i'm calling from Miami	3752	A
Utah well we've got a long distance connection tonight	3752	A
you ready to start i am	3752	A
well you know the first thing i thought about whenever uh i don't have children but i um have a friend who's a school teacher and uh	3752	A
she has told me some horror stories but uh other than that i was thinking about um the the fact that uh so many uh kids nowadays can't even identify on the map on a globe where they are	3752	A
and it's just astounding to me	3752	A
um	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah and i think you're right i think an awful lot of it has to do with uh the kind of emphasis that uh	3752	A
the the children get uh at home on education because um uh this friend of mine who's a school teacher was telling me she said uh you know uh	3752	A
that she has uh uh kids that uh are are Indian and Pakistani uh Oriental you know some of them who uh have only been uh in the United States maybe for two generations	3752	A
that uh she said their English is excellent uh their their social- social skills are good and uh you know why is it that uh that they can be such model citizens and uh yet	3752	A
you know other young kids- uh uh kids who have you know been uh born and uh bred here in the US uh just don't seem to get it	3752	A
right	3752	A
yeah i'm beginning to wonder if maybe um year round school would not be a bad uh a bad thing	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah	3752	A
yeah well i don't know i uh i uh	3752	A
i don't certainly don't have the answer to it i know that uh um in Houston uh for example where i'm i have some friends who uh uh	3752	A
were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that uh uh they want their kids to go to	3752	A
and uh	3752	A
yeah right and uh the idea of running a a school	3752	A
sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful uh uh uh less successful get less money uh	3752	A
yeah the	3752	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3752	A
but i don't know if that's the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way	3752	A
oh it's a nightmare	3752	A
well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write	3752	A
it's scary	3752	A
uh-huh	3752	A
all right Miss Kathy so uh what do you do do you do it regularly and so forth	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
well uh i have been so busy working i just retired about two weeks ago	3767	A
thank you my exercise basically has been what walking that i can get in	3767	A
which hasn't really been quite enough but i could very definitely tell the difference when i have two or three hours off and i run around on campus i'm retired from Penn State University	3767	A
and when i have an afternoon to walk around on campus i- i very definitely uh see a difference	3767	A
and it it i know that walking is good for you and uh i keep reading that it's much better for you than running because of the uh actions of the joints and so forth	3767	A
but uh tell me about_1 um your exercise did you take your exercise because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or whatever	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
how many how many hours a week do you estimate that you perform these things	3767	A
an hour a day uh-huh	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
do you ever have time when you don't get this exercise in and notice that your weight goes up or anything like that	3767	A
oh it's so you you can tell the difference	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
i- i understand what you're saying well what about eating do you uh	3767	A
do anything about the the type of food you eat is that uh or do you just eat a normal balanced meal to go with that	3767	A
um-hum	3767	A
yeah that that does keep you busy	3767	A
so you well uh	3767	A
well there're just two of us now my three children have all moved out	3767	A
so uh diet wise uh i'm trying to keep us on a low	3767	A
uh weight the low fat type of a diet my wife has high cholesterol	3767	A
so i'm trying to keep that down and and i do notice that when you go through	3767	A
periods uh such as Christmas and so forth where you eat out more often than normal if you don't get the exercise in your weight weight goes up	3767	A
and uh for me exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing -that weight down	3767	A
and-	3767	A
no it's up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say walking around on campus picking up mail and and doing things like that	3767	A
and running- running downtown uh during my lunch period	3767	A
well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in and	3767	A
yes	3767	A
do you we have a bicycle in the house	3767	A
uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do	3767	A
have you ever tried one of those	3767	A
uh-huh	3767	A
uh-huh -well i was thinking with you say you have four children	3767	A
with four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you	3767	A
well very good	3767	A
well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh as i say i've just retired so i'm just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and i'm	3767	A
considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control	3767	A
no i have one lives in Amsterdam Holland and uh one lives in uh	3767	A
near Warrington Pennsylvania and the other one is in New Jersey	3767	A
so	3767	A
well i- i have done research at Penn State i've i've uh not a teacher i've done research in under water acoustics	3767	A
it's been a noisy subject	3767	A
um yeah i do i play basketball on uh a city league and	3767	B
volleyball and	3767	B
how about_1 you	3767	B
oh congratulations	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
huh	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
yep	3767	B
um i do it purely for enjoyment in fact when i've started exercise programs that i felt like i had to do you know a system of doing so many sit ups and that i haven't stuck with it and haven't enjoyed it either one so	3767	B
i decided that i would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what i like more than just individual	3767	B
um whatever	3767	B
um probably	3767	B
at least an hour a day	3767	B
yeah do and i have four children so that keeps me busy too and they're all involved in	3767	B
sports mostly soccer so we	3767	B
once they're out there i you know i get out there and kick it around with them sometimes	3767	B
of course of course	3767	B
oh yeah not so much with weight as much as just not you know you feel sluggish and you get into that cycle where you don't want to exercise and so you don't and then you the the vicious cycle where	3767	B
where you don't exercise	3767	B
yeah i just eat normally i don't regulate- you know i'm not real regimented about what	3767	B
what i eat personally its too hard to to get myself on a certain diet having to fix for five other people in the house so	3767	B
yep	3767	B
how about_1 you	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
do you do it together with your wife or this mostly by yourself	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of walking in i know that i when i went to college you know just walking back and forth from different buildings you you have to	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
huh	3767	B
i haven't	3767	B
i haven't i do i have a bike and you know i usually have a child on the back of it because_1 mine are little	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
that would be a great- yeah it sure would that would be a great idea	3767	B
yeah	3767	B
oh that sounds	3767	B
yeah probably do your kids still live close by you	3767	B
oh	3767	B
uh-huh	3767	B
oh they're spread around what did you teach	3767	B
oh	3767	B
oh	3767	B
well that yeah well that would be interesting do you study like mammals or just sound	3767	B
what kind of crimes you have in Hattiesburg	3795	B
oh boy that's and Hattiesburg's not that big is it fifty thousand or so yeah	3795	B
well	3795	B
yeah we're real disgusted around here in Austin we live in the city and on December the sixth uh four teenage girls were murdered and mutilated two blocks from our house at a yogurt shop	3795	B
mutilated uh they cut them_1 up and they put ice cream inside their bodies and then they burnt the place down or tried to burn the place down as they left	3795	B
uh two of them_1 worked there and two of them_1 came to pick them_1 up when they got off their at at eleven o'clock that night and	3795	B
right or just shutting down just closing and i don't think the police have a clue uh they've had the FBI here and have some sort of analysis of who might have done it what type of person might have done it but	3795	B
yeah but	3795	B
it's just they're still begging for help and and and i just feel like some of they're helpless at uh trying to solve this one	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
that's true my wife and i read a lot of uh true crime books and you know court cases things like that	3795	B
and it boy it just upsets us when people get off with little or nothing they're they're on they're out on probation- probation in fifteen years after murdering half a dozen people and	3795	B
it's just not fair	3795	B
yes	3795	B
yeah i think about a year ago here in Austin they were we were uh the gang problem was getting real bad and they hired a hundred new policemen and a lot of them_1 were dedicated just to the crime unit or to the gang unit	3795	B
and just recently they announced that they've pretty much got it under control there was only one gang related murder this past year	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
i think one of the things that they need to do more of which i seen a little bit here in Austin though is getting actual people in neighborhoods involved	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
yeah uh	3795	B
seems to be that way i seems like everybody that we've heard of or know that go for any kind of psychiatric- psychiatric help uh every problem you've got is blamed on your parents	3795	B
and that to me that's just defeating the family right there	3795	B
i mean if you can	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
you know	3795	B
you know out of my own family i- i guess maybe i didn't have everything i wanted when i was growing up but i've as i've gotten older i've learned to accept the fact that i got what i needed i was clothed and sheltered and educated and	3795	B
i haven't blamed any of my future problems on on on the family upbringing or whatever	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
it's just i like i can't ever imagine my son committing a crime	3795	B
and i think he knows that you know that that's just something that not in in his world but there's so many people out there that do commit violent crimes and and small crimes and think nothing of it it's	3795	B
uh	3795	A
actually about anything you can imagine uh from you- you know this petty theft kind of crud going around vandalism up to uh certain amount of organized crime where uh	3795	A
gangs are starting to you know show up and actually you know qualify as gangs	3795	A
uh about_1 fifty- yeah right around fifty thousand we i think we- this census we just missed fifty thousand by a couple of people or something like that	3795	A
but uh yeah it's it's right at fifty thousand	3795	A
um-hum	3795	A
murdered and mutilated	3795	A
uh what these are girls who worked at this ice cream parlor or	3795	A
all right so this- so this is a place the the place had shut down already	3795	A
um	3795	A
yeah character profile psychiatric profile	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
ah shoot the the big problem is there's no real punishment for crime anymore i mean the bigger the crime the less likely you are to get punished for it	3795	A
i mean get adequately punished anyway	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
well they slaughter innocent- innocent- lots of innocent lives and they get you know a few years and a slap on the wrist and someone else turns around and you know embezzles a couple of thousand dollars from the local bank and they you know they practically get fried	3795	A
yes	3795	A
um-hum	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
that's good if nothing else they've got the gangs pushed down to where they're you know not going to be very active at least as far as you know murders or open crimes are concerned	3795	A
yeah the neighborhood watch type programs yeah that's one that's the one thing that starting you know the only two things that are really making a difference	3795	A
are when the local people get involved and when they start doing something positive with families families have gone in the toilet in the last twenty thirty years	3795	A
and it's as though they're really trying to push to make sure they go down the toilet lot of people- lot of institutions they seem to be fighting against family	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah well to a certain extent it can be traced back there and and and that's okay to say so as long as you understand that you got to forgive	3795	A
it's not like they doing it on purpose usually very seldom are they doing it on purpose	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
i had some modicum at least of acceptance and support	3795	A
yeah well that's the way it was with us we had i had a pretty good family life by comparison- i had an excellent family life by comparison to a lot of people out there	3795	A
it may not have been perfect but they did what they knew how to do and they did it the best they knew how so	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah i mean considering the conscious it seems to go it- it- it almost invariably does start with the destruction of the family i mean	3795	A
almost invariably children aren't taught respect they're not taught discipline they're not taught the need to	3795	A
see in the newspaper or on the news when uh President Bush fainted at a dinner it was that in Japan	3726	A
um	3726	A
well i thought it was pretty scary i i missed it uh i mean i when they were rerunning- rerunning it like the next day or something mean i didn't hear about it on the day it happened but i	3726	A
it was interesting you know that when he fainted and every one kind of jumped up on the table and surrounded him and it's really amazing that that would happen and then of course all the Dan Quayle discussion comes up again	3726	A
that's uh that is true that is real good well he you know as for as young as he is he seems to have had several health problems- you know health uh incidences if not problems	3726	A
right that's right well i um	3726	A
i guess i haven't really been i've been trying to tune out a lot of the political issues right now when because the campaigning is starting and uh so	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
right	3726	A
it is scary	3726	A
yes	3726	A
uh-huh	3726	A
right they're foreign students	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
well they seem	3726	A
well that's really true and but i have noticed from uh my associations with teenagers in high school that they are really motivated by how much money they can make and when they hear on the news about people being laid off	3726	A
and uh you know corporations and things i mean i feel like they don't wanna make the effort out of um their own personal interests to follow a particular field or they wanna think you know how quickly can they make money	3726	A
and they're not attracted by the the work that has to be done to achieve	3726	A
uh you know a position like that	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
right	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
well you're right when you say that um	3726	A
the important issues need to be not so as much what's going on other places i mean that it's important for us to do	3726	A
i mean we we can't be isolated here but um you know we do need to pay more attention to our own economy and	3726	A
and our own civilization because we've seen how quickly and it's almost unbelievable the fall of the um Soviet Union and and the um Berlin Wall and all of that's almost unreal to me still	3726	A
that was in Japan uh i didn't get to see that uh we've uh just gotten back yesterday from vacation	3726	B
and so i was bumping up and down the highway in a camper and uh i didn't get to watch any television so i've just been finding out about this once i got back	3726	B
yeah well i was kind of pleased that uh when i got back that that was the hot item on the news that uh the President had fainted at dinner because_1 that means that nothing else happened anywhere in the world	3726	B
yeah well you need about three kids running around the house and uh you you'd have your share of health problem too	3726	B
yeah	3726	B
well i think the key issue that's going on at the moment is the current economy	3726	B
and i think there's a lot of things that need to be done to to rectify that situation i'm not sure that the government is the key player	3726	B
um	3726	B
i think one of the statements that was made uh a year ago by uh Gorbachev	3726	B
when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the Soviet Union he made the comment he said well our country may be bankrupt but referring to the United States he says your schools are bankrupt	3726	B
and uh that's been a big concern for me	3726	B
and i noticed that uh when i go into the tougher courses at some of the universities like Organic Chemistry or something like that	3726	B
that uh you don't find very many white American males taking the tough courses	3726	B
you find you find a lot of Asian students uh you find uh a lot of females in the class	3726	B
and in all of the tough courses that i have taken the only blacks that i've found in the class have have generally been from Nigeria or some other African country they're foreign students	3726	B
and it's i think it's kind of pathetic that uh	3726	B
our kids are not motivated to uh	3726	B
to study in depth and uh to take the hard courses and i'm i'm concerned that that is our economic problem not not how much money is being spent at Christmas time	3726	B
um-hum	3726	B
yeah well i know when i went through school uh i went through an engineering school and of all my close friends they were all there because they loved engineering	3726	B
they loved building things they loved solving problems uh they liked	3726	B
you know being creative and there was another group of students there that were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of money	3726	B
and we didn't mix very well you know there was a a total difference in attitude and we felt very	3726	B
isolated or uh discriminated against in not being you know separate classes in terms of attitude	3726	B
um-hum	3726	B
yeah	3726	B
well that was a terribly precarious economy- economy uh i've been kind of watching it over the years and observing that the the amount of bureaucracy over there	3726	B
uh where did you go	3762	A
well interestingly enough i'm calling from Miami	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
well yeah	3762	A
well you know that's something i've never done is go down to the Keys although i i'm just here on business but uh i would love to go down there	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be	3762	A
when i was a kid uh we used to go camping up in the Ozarks in Arkansas	3762	A
and uh we found a pretty remote campground uh uh actually whenever we first started going to it you had to drive about twenty five miles on a gravel road	3762	A
to get back up into it and uh it had uh no electricity and uh it had a hand pump for water	3762	A
but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you	3762	A
but uh that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping	3762	A
yeah well now yeah you kind of remind me of a friend of mine who who said her idea of roughing it is slow room service	3762	A
but uh yeah i've got a uh i've got a friend of mine in Houston who has a forty two foot uh Tartan sailboat	3762	A
and uh it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because he's got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on it	3762	A
well that's hard work	3762	A
yeah i've i've been with it on on several uh races we've run the Pensacola yacht race for a couple of years	3762	A
and uh but no i love to sail and i agree i had never thought- really thought about that as camping before but that is- that is probably one of the best ways to go	3762	A
what did you do did you rent a motor home when you came to Florida	3762	A
was it what is that expensive	3762	A
well that's cheaper than a hotel room really	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
how big was the one you rented	3762	A
yeah was that uh any problem driving or	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
oh really	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah yeah	3762	A
oh sure yeah yeah that always irritates me when i pass somebody several times i've i've been in the other in the other uh uh uh had the shoe on the other foot	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah right right right	3762	A
uh	3762	A
no we just uh i guess i'm hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping	3762	B
in a recreational vehicle	3762	B
we took a tour of Florida	3762	B
okay well i was down there visiting the uh the orchid jungle	3762	B
there in uh Homestead	3762	B
came back with about ten plants that i hadn't planned on	3762	B
yeah we were down past Miami went down into the Keys	3762	B
um well we found it a little bit of a disappointment uh we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy	3762	B
and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh	3762	B
uh well Key West was uh just coral rubble	3762	B
and uh we did find Bahia Honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach	3762	B
but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to to go in and and snorkel and and do those sort of things	3762	B
um-hum	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
hum	3762	B
well my uh my wife talks a lot about camping and uh she's taken the girls uh on off to Girl Scout camp a couple of times	3762	B
but my idea of camping is in a either an RV or in a thirty- thirty five foot sailboat	3762	B
right	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that uh was doing a lot of racing	3762	B
and uh and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable	3762	B
um-hum	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America	3762	B
uh it was running about eighty seven dollars a day	3762	B
that's cheaper than a hotel and you add uh oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site	3762	B
and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth	3762	B
we had a uh thirty two footer	3762	B
well it's it's a big truck uh but uh	3762	B
when you get that big a truck the uh the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five	3762	B
so uh i just uh had a change of mind set and i would set the uh autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you	3762	B
and you just stay in the right lane and there's nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it	3762	B
so it's kind of a pleasant way to drive you	3762	B
uh i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one	3762	B
yeah because_1 you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know he's got a colorful car that you recognize and	3762	B
the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich	3762	B
and uh well we enjoyed it uh one of of places we visited was uh Walt Disney World	3762	B
oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook	3791	A
don't like to cook huh	3791	A
make a mean spaghetti huh	3791	A
uh got kids married- married	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
well uh my wife and i we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet	3791	A
uh	3791	A
uh uh yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that	3791	A
let's see a good dinner party menu	3791	A
i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming i guess	3791	A
i don't know	3791	A
uh something light and easy if it was pretty informal- informal about_1 anything	3791	A
roast chicken	3791	A
oh gosh yeah how do you usually cook your deer how do you usually cook your deer	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
i imagine	3791	A
i would imagine it is	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah i understand	3791	A
we just had uh	3791	A
deer stew sort of uh deer- deer steak stew	3791	A
um	3791	A
what was it about	3791	A
a day day and a half in the crock pot um uh some deer steaks	3791	A
in kind of a mushroom gravy	3791	A
um some veggies and a	3791	A
delicious no no the times i've been out deer hunting i- i- i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa	3791	A
i mean i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles	3791	A
so no this- this was given to us by some friends	3791	A
um guy was in a uh	3791	A
in a hunting club	3791	A
and you know but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it's split with the rest with everybody in the group	3791	A
well he wound- they they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit so there's everybody had deer coming out their ears	3791	A
so	3791	A
no	3791	A
we we either crock pot deer or we'll uh you know put it out on the grill so that so that the bulk of the uh tallow will dribble off of it	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah that is good	3791	A
deer spaghetti is real good	3791	A
anyway um	3791	A
no i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have uh	3791	A
sandwiches or	3791	A
something along those lines and then uh	3791	A
um	3791	A
you know just something light finger food sort of something or	3791	A
or maybe have something roasting out on a fire	3791	A
oh well anyway um we don't do much in the way of entertaining but usually it's one other couple come over for a dinner	3791	A
let's see what did we have the last time we had guests over ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf	3791	A
was kind of taco turkey loaf	3791	A
uh it was good	3791	A
uh scalloped potatoes and	3791	A
no it was mashed potatoes mashed potatoes with uh melted- cheese melted over the top of them_1	3791	A
a couple things like that	3791	A
it was pretty good little dinner	3791	A
yeah usually the kind	3791	A
oh don't you hate that	3791	A
yeah i've got a i got a a few pounds to lose myself	3791	A
that's okay i've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah i was- was a left fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade- grade at two	3791	A
none to cook i don't like to cook spaghetti i guess though i make a mean spaghetti	3791	B
yeah	3791	B
no huh-uh just my husband and i and the two dogs so what about yours	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
hm	3791	B

thank you	3791	B
um-hum um-hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
well sometimes we'll have uh we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer	3791	B
huh	3791	B
how do we usually on the grill we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill and it is good	3791	B
real good	3791	B
either that or hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B

um-hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B

uh-huh	3728	B
oh uh-huh	3728	B
yeah	3728	B
um-hum	3728	B
yeah yeah now i also i get it from all over i watch the news every day and i have- we have a news you know we get the newspaper and uh	3728	B
um	3728	B
magazines anything- anything you know i'm i read a lot so i get um you know i'm i'm really up on uh current affairs i get you know	3728	B
the news and and everything	3728	B
um well i'm not getting any- no i'm not getting any news magazines but um	3728	B
you know as- as i said i do	3728	B
uh it's uh it's easy to keep up on current events- you know on certainly- you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day	3728	B
and uh	3728	B
and i don't know you know what what's i mean what what are we supposed to uh	3728	B
compare it to you know i mean the quality uh	3728	B
whatever they tell you you know i uh	3728	B
i guess i'm uh i you know i'm satisfied i mean i uh	3728	B
you- you- you know they're they're supposedly covering everything that happens so you know	3728	B
oh really	3728	B
oh	3728	B
well uh sometimes it's such a you know it's it's so um	3728	B
slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the	3728	B
paper but most of the time- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there uh you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it	3728	B
but um	3728	B
oh well that's what sells papers	3728	B
that's um that's been like that since they the first newspaper you know	3728	B
you know but um	3728	B
i don't know i- i guess i'm satisfied i don't uh	3728	B
i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really we don't get a you know	3728	B
oh yeah i was gonna	3728	B
sure	3728	B
yeah sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad	3728	B
it's all so negative you know	3728	B
but	3728	B
well we have to keep talking i guess	3728	B
oh	3728	B
oh is it really	3728	B
well yeah i don't i don't uh	3728	B
i don't know we're supposed- i guess we're supposed to wait or	3728	B
i don't know	3728	B
cause- i you know like one well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening	3728	B
yeah and it was really we were laughing i mean but you know we don't really do any gardening so like that took like a minute	3728	B
and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean	3728	B
you know i mean some topics really now you know now this topic this is i mean there really isn't much to say after	3728	B
you know you uh you you know you you tell a person what uh news their a	3728	B
you know where their where they find their sources of of information from and then you know if if it's uh if they're satisfied and that's about it really	3728	B
it's hard to talk for five minutes on this	3728	B
so um	3728	B
um no i don't watch much TV sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news but i don't think of that every day even	3728	A
um i think i get most of my current events well i get them from everywhere i sometimes watch TV if i- i guess i watch TV if i haven't read the paper that day we don't get a paper but i work um	3728	A
at a i teach college class and uh there's a the library has a paper and so i often drop in on a break and	3728	A
and read it and then i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home	3728	A
and then i i figure if there's big big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah what's your favorite news do you do you get a news magazine or	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah we've got	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah exactly are you satisfied with the quality of coverage	3728	A
yeah it's kind of hard to know isn't it	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah yeah well i do feel like a little bit like being from California and	3728	A
wanting to hear like i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something and i don't ever hear it in the news here you know it's um	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah yeah	3728	A
yeah i sometimes feel like um the Dallas paper and the Dallas News	3728	A
um the top headlines are always a murder you know and that's because there's a high crime rate yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah yeah i'm sure	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah really	3728	A
that's true we certainly get enough coverage i mean we we-	3728	A
we can get news you know i mean there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day so	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
often times	3728	A
so	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
well no i guess we can end yeah it's just whenever we're	3728	A
um yeah have you always gone until the recording	3728	A
uh-huh oops i guess we're not supposed to	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
oh really it just	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh interesting yeah	3728	A
um-hum	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
um-hum	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah well i guess i can just say i uh it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that	3728	A
well it seems like i don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um you know you'll hear one report and then you'll hear that it you know they didn't um	3728	A
did you hear our topic and it's in regards to discussing homes	3773	A
yeah i'm settled in a place i've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight	3773	A
in it's in Richardson Texas which is North Texas or North Dallas	3773	A
and we've lived in two houses in Richardson we moved here in seventy four and uh changed locations in seventy eight	3773	A
how about_1 yourself	3773	A
yes nice area	3773	A
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or	3773	A
oh boy	3773	A
right- right	3773	A
sure	3773	A
no we're settled and uh	3773	A
we're uh	3773	A
i'm probably older than you i'm fifty two but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year and graduating college so i can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe	3773	A
oh gosh so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere closer closer to our families	3773	A
no i'm from West Virginia but everyone's uh my wife's parents are from the New York New Jersey area	3773	A
so but everyone seems uh has seemed to relocated down that area seems like a nice place to go	3773	A
oh i understand you need very minimum of four and probably five	3773	A
as far	3773	A
right	3773	A
it's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isn't it	3773	A
right	3773	A
matter of looking right	3773	A
lot of people will buy a four- in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had uh there were seven kids in her family	3773	A
oh sure	3773	A
oh i know and it's there's nothing harder than that i always just sort of a	3773	A
assign my wife that chore then i would let her narrow it down to three or four then i'd go look because	3773	A
women seem to like to look a lot more than men do	3773	A
yes	3773	A
why certainly	3773	A
i understand that	3773	A
i'm in the uh sporting goods business i'm a manufacturer's rep i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies	3773	A
who- who are you with	3773	A
uh-huh	3773	A
well great	3773	A
how how was the uh you say- you say you lived in the Denver area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing- housing prices	3773	A
no kidding	3773	A
homes yes sir um-hum	3773	B
what are are you settled in a place	3773	B
right um-hum	3773	B
okay	3773	B
well we uh left here in seventy six uh we were here for a few years then we uh have come back just this summer right now we're looking for housing	3773	B
uh somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area are you familiar that	3773	B
yeah it is the kids are in school here in Duncanville we're in a temporary place right now and uh so they've enjoyed the school so we're kind of trying to stay here but	3773	B
well what the problem we got is that we've got five children	3773	B
and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing so we uh	3773	B
we look at the paper we look at our talk to our realtor and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five are you looking or you settled i mean having- having finished	3773	B
oh great	3773	B
that empty nest syndrome is gonna set in i guess	3773	B
great	3773	B
okay	3773	B
okay you are you from Florida originally	3773	B
yeah	3773	B
oh yeah	3773	B
yeah yeah we've got five and the oldest is uh ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and i think they're gonna be uh with us forever	3773	B
i don't know if that's true but it's sure you know we're- we're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size we're we're trying to find the	3773	B
oh yeah in fact six would be real good my wife and i can share a bedroom and there	3773	B
oh i don't think it's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that yeah	3773	B
oh yeah	3773	B
yeah it is yeah we're- um we're having actually	3773	B
if we find something for uh i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know that's uh but i think the thing's out there it's just a matter of uh	3773	B
you know looking you know finding the right place uh	3773	B
wow	3773	B
oh yeah yeah i think once we get into a place it'll be just fine but um you know it's until then it's uh	3773	B
oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing that's all	3773	B
oh yeah maybe that's the case at least she's got more opinions you know there's uh	3773	B
seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know	3773	B
so what- what kind of business are you in	3773	B
oh yeah great	3773	B
uh we're with an organization called uh Wycliffe Bible Translators it's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing	3773	B
uh it's got an office down here in uh it near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so	3773	B
it	3773	B
right	3773	B
uh we were uh	3773	B
really surprised to find that they're higher here uh	3773	B
when we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not	3773	B
i guess um	3773	B
really prices for housing are just	3773	B
okay uh personal computer- i don't have a personal computer i'd like to have one if i had more money i'd have one	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
is it is it hard to find uh compatible pieces for your the one you have at home	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
oh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month they're coming out with something new and so then you're not compatible- oh yeah	3783	A
uh even with like the computer games Nintendo and that kind of stuff i mean they change it every year and the the previous game or the previous program or whatever isn't compatible	3783	A
oh	3783	A
oh okay	3783	A
well that isn't that doesn't sound too bad	3783	A
um not really not in my work um i did try and take a class um i think last was it last spring	3783	A
no actually it was last fall it was at at i took desktop publishing i just wanted to get sort of a a slight feel for it and it was just an introduction course	3783	A
and it was pretty fascinating we we learned how to do how to make a brochure type thing out out- off- off the computer so it was pretty interesting	3783	A
oh so you've yeah	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
now the Lotus is for mostly numbers and graphs and things like that right yeah	3783	A
i'm not real good with computers at all and that's mainly because i don't use them i wish i did i'd be you know	3783	A
more up on it	3783	A
oh my goodness yes	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
have you heard about the phone that uh believe it's AT and T	3783	A
uh is it AT and T that's coming out with the phone with the like on the Jetsons when you could see the you could see the person's face	3783	A
have you seen that yeah	3783	A
yeah yeah i saw that in a in a magazine recently i was really shocked yeah	3783	A
oh i know hopefully you can	3783	A
have control over whether they can see you or not	3783	A
but it looked pretty nice and it's only gonna be two thousand dollars so which is not bad for something new like that so	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
oh	3783	A
my mother does a lot of work on computers and she taps into computers all over the world she works at at she works at TI and uh	3783	A
yeah uh-huh and uh you know she talks to people through the computer from everywhere so i think i think that's really neat too	3783	A
okay uh-huh	3783	A
maybe she knows my mother because_1 my mother used to work in Plano now she works in uh north Dallas i think so	3783	A
but	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
i visited with some kids in elementary school and nowadays a lot of the schools have computers and the kids are really they're more interested in their schoolwork	3783	A
with the computer you know they can also play games but then they can help them write papers and helps with their math and that kind of thing	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
and there's always something new even if you know even if you think you know everything about the computer there's always one button	3783	A
that you never quite use and you don't really know what it's for and you know it can be fascinating in that way too especially for a kid that you know is just learning so	3783	A
well hopefully i'll be able to get a computer at some point i don't know when but i don't need one right now	3783	A
but there's gonna come a time i'm sure when everybody's gonna have to have one	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
uh-huh i've got one	3783	B
i do have one but it's a kind of an old one that uh they didn't use at work any longer it's not the not the greatest one but uh i use one at work quite a bit all day long in fact	3783	B
yeah because_1 it's a little bit older and uh it's a it's a Wang machine and Wang was you know a leader a while ago but now they're kind of out of it	3783	B
what's that	3783	B
oh yeah constantly- constantly changing	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
most of the uh you know WordPerfect and Lotus and those kinds of programs you can subscribe to an update service for about_1 fifty dollars a year i think they'll give you the the next release of their software	3783	B
and but uh	3783	B
yeah do you use one much	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
sure uh-huh	3783	B
oh	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
yeah oh i'm a CPA and i use it almost all the time for this Lotus program i'll have -well lot of good applications for what i have to do	3783	B
yeah or uh spreadsheets and that type of thing yeah it's	3783	B
huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
oh yeah uh-huh when you have a vision with the sound uh-huh	3783	B
oh really	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
well you know they've got these uh all these modems- uh computers have modems in them_1 now where you can call all over the place uh	3783	B
i can do a fair amount of work from home and tap into our company's main computer system without much trouble	3783	B
uh-huh this is uh how you got signed up for it uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah well i have a sister lives in Plano that's my connection with the project	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
but i you know there are i've got a six year old and i think he's	3783	B
he's got quite a bit of interest in uh in playing around with the one we have at home and it's not a it's not a real fun one it's not a color or i don't have much in the way of game software	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah i think it	3783	B
yeah you know adds a dimension that uh probably makes learning a little bit more fun if you get to you know	3783	B
try things a little different than just the standard pencil and paper and crayons	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
um-hum	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
oh i think that day'll happen i'm hoping and perhaps uh what'll ultimately happen is you won't have to commute as much but you'll be able to do so much from home	3783	B
that uh you know you won't have to be driving around like-	3783	B
well you know there's uh the uh the the the one that's burning in everybody's uh	3744	B
in everybody's mind the uh break up of the Soviet Union and it's a	3744	B
ah it's- it's it's effects here at home	3744	B
i mean it's gonna have effects all over the world and uh	3744	B
course you know i- i expect uh in the next few days when uh the president gives his uh State of the Union address	3744	B
he's got to have to uh	3744	B
pull some uh	3744	B
real drastic changes in what he's doing to to promote some	3744	B
some movement and enthusiasm behind his reelection race	3744	B
yeah	3744	B
yeah well they- they they focused all of their economic capacity on on on their military	3744	B
i mean if they had focused the same capacity in their uh commercial stuff they would've been a lot better off as a society probably uh	3744	B
yes like the Japanese right	3744	B
and	3744	B
um-hum	3744	B
well uh you know five- five years ago could you have- have imagined in your in your your wildest dreams that something as as a change as rapid as this would've occurred	3744	B
it's just you know it it's almost unthinkable but it it is hey in a i i still wonder whether you know that it's going to be stable and then what's going to happen there	3744	B
but i don't think the shelves -is bare anymore	3744	B
i think there's now you know i think all the time there were goods	3744	B
to to be distributed that were being held off	3744	B
and uh	3744	B
you know i- i i think that uh	3744	B
there's still- but but you know the the people don't have a lot of money to pay for them there there's a tremendous uh	3744	B
gap in their ability to to supply themselves uh uh that could create a tremendous amount of political stability- instability in fact they said tonight on the on the radio uh that	3744	B
uh	3744	B
some some leader in in in of- of the parliament in- in Russia is calling for Yeltsin to essentially throw out all of his ministers and replace them	3744	B
because of this- this tremendous supply demand uh type gap that they have there	3744	B
uh	3744	B
i don't know it it's it's	3744	B
-it's hard to imagine managing such a rapid change	3744	B
well and and i think that you know we we stand uh	3744	B
in- in in the possibility of- of in of of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here uh everybody -is is calling for you know this this- this- this	3744	B
uh peace dividend and	3744	B
it the- with- with an election year coming up there's the uh that- there's the the-	3744	B
the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to to	3744	B
appeal to the voters to to- to get elected but you know how how rapidly can they change and how rapid can they move	3744	B
well you got a topic	3744	A
yeah i think- i- i think that's the obvious one isn't it	3744	A
yeah well it it's truly amazing to um see how rapidly um uh the Soviet Union fell apart um uh	3744	A
and it makes me wonder i'm not saying that i'm uh i'm certainly not a hawk necessarily	3744	A
but it makes me wonder i've thought about this if the idea of uh uh the the arms race while granted it has practically- practically bankrupted this country	3744	A
uh perhaps it did bankrupt uh Russia and was you know as a as a way of making a a a political change was certainly preferable to a war	3744	A
right	3744	A
yeah with the right kind of- the Japanese for example	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
well	3744	A
i don't know what we've we've seen so many changes just in the past five years uh it makes me think it reminds me of that book uh Future Shock	3744	A
where the the future is coming at us uh at such an accelerated pace day after day	3744	A
that only the most adaptable are gonna be able to uh survive and and keep from just being overrun by the changes	3744	A
oh no no	3744	A
it really is	3744	A
well and that's just it i i have some	3744	A
i have doubts that uh	3744	A
that it can be ah stable number one you've got uh you know you see on the news	3744	A
the the stories- the stories and the and the sights of these these the Soviet people these Russian people that are standing in line	3744	A
uh for hours on end and have for you know bare shelves at in these hugely you know uh higher prices that they have to pay now that- that government controls are off	3744	A
oh are they are they back- are they have they got some um	3744	A
but they're on the black market	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
hm	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
yeah and i don't- i don't that's just it it's funny- it's inconceivable- inconceivable to me to think that anyone or any entity i don't care	3744	A
what it is could actually manage i mean it would it's kind of like damage control and maybe putting out the biggest fires but i don't think that it's really a manageable uh of set of circumstances	3744	A
well as far as i'm concerned i can change pretty doggone rapidly and i'm all for something radical because i think it's gonna take something radical to turn this country around um	3744	A
well what kind of vacations do you like to take are you	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah where have you gone there	3768	A
um-hum	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah well i've been over there too i even let's see um mostly Germany and France i lived in France for a year and a half so	3768	A
i was able but i loved when i had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of traveling around France i went to Germany because uh i've got relatives there and i just like it there	3768	A
so but um Austria i found really pretty and Switzerland yeah and i i lived in the Alps in France so i	3768	A
anything in the mountains over there i just love	3768	A
then i finally made it to England too um on my way home um so i lived in Africa actually and on my way home from there yeah	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
so um and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from Nairobi you have to fly through um uh Europe on your way home so i went to England and i really liked it there too	3768	A
i know it's true that's the one thing	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah actually now you can get some really good deals flying over but it's once you're there you still have to spend money	3768	A
unless you know people you know	3768	A
uh-huh and- that helps a lot	3768	A
but	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh yeah	3768	A
i haven't i've been i've most of my vacationing in the US has been on the West Coast	3768	A
or this summer i went to Colorado	3768	A
and uh i'd love to go to the East Coast during the fall	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
um-hum	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh i haven't been there anywhere on the East Coast i	3768	A
i think Tennessee's been the furthest east i've been	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah i guess so	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh yeah	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah so the type of vacation you'd like i mean like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week	3768	A
yeah mainly- mainly probably because_1 you wanna see everything and yeah	3768	A
yeah i know how it is	3768	A
well i liked it um i was working in Cameroon Africa and it's not a	3768	A
it's not a place for tourists i mean they're not used to having tourists there so it's you're kind of roughing it but um i liked it i liked it the people there are just very very friendly and	3768	A
um i was working with an organization that does Bible translation	3768	A
so i was doing linguistic work actually traveling around finding out about languages and uh what they call survey work find out where the languages are	3768	A
so i traveled a lot around- around the country and met a lot of people and	3768	A
um	3768	A
yeah i enjoyed it so	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah my cousin came over while i was there and she came to Cameroon then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around	3768	A
you know close to Nairobi in Kenya so she'd always dreamed of doing that too	3768	A
so	3768	A
yeah so is there anyplace you would try to talk me into going to it sounds like we've been to some of the same places but	3768	A
well we've uh we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe so	3768	B
so i i guess those are the types i like we've really enjoyed them we've gone to um Germany Switzerland Austria	3768	B
Ireland and England we've been to Germany twice but um i guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland	3768	B
uh-huh where have you been	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh that's neat	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
oh yeah	3768	B
you lived in Africa oh my goodness wow	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
it's so expensive over there	3768	B
it really is it just it's it's i love to go over there but it's so darn expensive	3768	B
to go over	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
oh i know just	3768	B
right and you can stay with them and yeah yeah	3768	B
you know there's a lot of places in the States that we haven't even gone	3768	B
you know i'd like to go to Hawaii sometime and and uh we- we made it we've we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls so	3768	B
feel like we've accomplished a little bit here	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
the oh the it's oh i've always wanted to go there i've seen pictures and and it looks gorgeous	3768	B
we um we made a trip up the East Coast it was uh in the summer and it really is pretty	3768	B
it's uh both coasts are really pretty	3768	B
but um i love the Carolinas it's just gorgeous over there	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
well you'll just have to plan a vacation sometime	3768	B
and- and- go over there yeah but it's you know there's lots to see here	3768	B
but i just love going over to Europe because_1 it's so their way of life is just so different than ours you know we're so fast paced here and	3768	B
over there you know every time we'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we always have to ask for the check	3768	B
you know they're so leisurely over there and it's kind of nice to to have that	3768	B
well usually a bunch of different places	3768	B
right see as much as you can while you're there	3768	B
yeah how did you like Africa	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
what type of work	3768	B
oh okay	3768	B
oh uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
that's neat	3768	B
i've i've always um i've talked to people who've been to Africa and they	3768	B
and then of course when that movie Out of Africa came out um but i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
yeah that's great	3768	B
um	3768	B
all right	3709	B
um exercise huh	3709	B
um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings i belong to Presidents and uh i've got a routine for every morning of the week and i don't work out on Saturday or Sunday	3709	B
but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training	3709	B
no i i actually i just you know joined on my own and i've been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives	3709	B
but i pretty much uh worked on my own routine	3709	B
they've got the track on the inside and uh i run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i run two miles	3709	B
and then after that i work out with weights	3709	B
uh and i work out with free weights	3709	B
oh uh yeah it's really uh aerobic work out part	3709	B
uh about seven minutes	3709	B
uh no i do yeah that's that's a pretty good pretty good clip and i'll be i'm pretty winded by the time i get done	3709	B
so	3709	B
oh yeah i- i could i could probably go faster but then i'd wear myself out and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else	3709	B
yeah how about_1 you	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
oh i see	3709	B
so just uh just try and keep them_1 uh i guess uh firm and	3709	B
yeah yeah that's true	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
hm	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
oh i see	3709	B
i see	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
oh i see uh so you're in uh in part of a band	3709	B
oh i see i see i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school but it wasn't the trumpet so i was just wondering if that's what it was or something	3709	B
i see	3709	B
so you you have any plans of maybe running- running more when the weather gets nicer	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
um-hum yeah i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh a while back i was more into basketball and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves	3709	B
and uh but it's been a while since i've done that	3709	B
i see	3709	B
right right	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah i- i that's true i've noticed that uh	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
uh-huh	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah huh that's that's interesting though i you know i've been thinking of changing i've done the same routine for almost two years now and i'm thinking it of changing it up	3709	B
uh that's why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine	3709	B
because_1 i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing	3709	B
so i'm looking at changing things a little bit	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah huh	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
they set that up for you	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
and uh what kind of running do you do	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
is it just aerobic or	3709	A
no i mean the running	3709	A
you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less	3709	A
uh-huh and then you wouldn't then you don't get um out of breath	3709	A
oh	3709	A
oh	3709	A
but i mean he's just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
right yeah	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
yeah i- i don't run much any more i did when i was in school i right now i just lift um	3709	A
weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and that's about it	3709	A
and i don't i don't lift any heavy weights uh they're about_1 a third of my body weight	3709	A
yeah and um um i play the trumpet and uh the more	3709	A
upper body strength the easier it is to play you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh	3709	A
and then i- i hurt my neck uh about_1 three years ago so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from	3709	A
um hurting yourself when you play high	3709	A
you have to you have to do it correctly it's you know it's like an exercise in itself but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it	3709	A
um i play at church	3709	A
and	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
well yeah	3709	A
well yeah well the weather's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in Dallas yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesn't that doesn't get it done i- i- i mostly jump rope more you know	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah i- i do a toe lift and squats for that but you know i it it doesn't um	3709	A
it doesn't um	3709	A
accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you're running for a long time they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time	3709	A
and it also builds too much mass if you just you know	3709	A
so and it's like i- i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with	3709	A
and um then it doesn't bother me very much	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
right	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah that's i- i started doing more push ups and it it's helped a lot and then i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out i don't try to push it to the end in one set	3709	A
so i have just about_1 everything at sometime or other	3761	B
oh probably no more than say five at the time	3761	B
well i like uh McCalls Reader's	3761	B
yeah- uh-huh Reader's Digest Redbook um Good uh let's see Good Housekeeping Better Homes and Gardens um and uh-huh	3761	B
uh-huh yeah i- i love to get recipes you know out of the magazine i cut them_1 out put them_1 in a book and yeah	3761	B
oh yeah oh i also um usually get a magazine about travel and um	3761	B
not not really um uh	3761	B
i- i read them_1 and you know get ideas but um i don't travel that much	3761	B
so but i	3761	B
yes it really is yeah and um oh i like the uh beauty tips and you know all that fashion stuff and um	3761	B
no not really i- i just read them a from the magazines that i get i don't really take a fashion magazine or anything	3761	B
oh no just just what's in the regular magazines	3761	B
but uh	3761	B
yeah that's true it's	3761	B
that's uh that's right you sure would oh yeah i you know keep entering these contests taking all of these magazines thinking i'll win that big	3761	B
yeah right oh and there's several others that uh i get through the mail and uh you know they have contests like that not as big as that one but	3761	B
anyway i've always been kind of a sucker i guess for magazines	3761	B
yeah you can yeah that's true um Redbook i've always taken Redbook for years and years and years they used to have a novel in the back	3761	B
yeah but they quit doing that and i sure miss it	3761	B
yeah it's similar to like McCalls or something like that yeah	3761	B
yeah not too much different	3761	B
yes definitely uh-huh yeah but they have some good short stories too	3761	B
and uh but i really miss that novel it used to make- to take me oh say a Sunday afternoon you know i'd crawl up on the couch with my Redbook and read the novel	3761	B
yeah i don't know why they did i never did hear anything at all about it all of a sudden it was just gone	3761	B
yeah they used to be a big magazine and you know they cut the size down and	3761	B
all but uh	3761	B
oh is that right well i can remember yeah seeing Savvy i don't know that i ever subscribed to it but i've seen it you know in	3761	B
well i subscribe to a few magazines on a regular basis how about you	3761	A
oh really they like you	3761	A
really how many how many uh would you say at any given time you tend to subscribe to	3761	A
uh-huh uh-huh what are your favorites	3761	A
we subscribe to that one now too	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
do you like that one	3761	A
i had i had started that one about a year ago thinking that it would be a nice way to get some decorating tips and and more interior kinds of things but um	3761	A
it's really a collection of everything it has got a lot of um	3761	A
home making kinds of things too you know food as well as indoor and outdoor stuff	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
do you use the tips and a suggestions do you do you travel often enough that you are able to to take advantage of it	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
just fun just sort of	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3761	A
the thing i like about magazines is that they are a wonderful diversion for a brief period of time if you feel like you are not in the mood to really sit down with a book for a long time it's it's a perfect short	3761	A
uh	3761	A
attention getter	3761	A
uh-huh uh-huh do you do you have favorite fashion oriented magazines	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
oh uh-huh none that are specifically focused on fashion	3761	A
yeah	3761	A
i have a friend who works for a magazine that's based in France called Elle	3761	A
and and i remember seeing it enough times at her house that	3761	A
i wondered how often people subscribe to those kinds of magazines because_1 you almost have to be in the business to be as intrigued with some of those fashions they're so bizarre	3761	A
we all have to change our wardrobe regularly enough to invest in the magazine	3761	A
Publisher's Clearing House	3761	A
well that's sort of another uh added attraction of those uh contests i guess you could probably enter the contests without getting the magazines but it's not much fun	3761	A
um-hum	3761	A
oh really	3761	A
hm i don't know Redbook very well what what does it tend to be a mix of uh fashion and and recipes and that sort of thing or what what did	3761	A
oh is it uh-huh	3761	A
tend to focus more on women's issues than	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
um-hum um-hum	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
that's interesting i always thought that that was a big enough attraction in a lot of magazines that they i'm surprised that they would get rid of it	3761	A
um-hum	3761	A
um-hum McCalls certainly has changed a lot of over the years	3761	A
uh-huh	3761	A
i used to get one called Savvy that went out of business or merged or something and	3761	A
since i had only half the subscription through they automatically switched all their readers	3761	A
instead of Savvy got McCalls and that's how i got introduced to it	3761	A
yeah	3761	A
i liked it i thought it was kind of a nice	3761	A
um i guess uh i like to play golf	3746	B
and um i also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts	3746	B
well we live uh pretty close to the Mesquite Golf Course	3746	B
so we'll play either out there or at Firewheel that's usually where we play but i've played you know different courses in in the Dallas area	3746	B
uh both not at the same time	3746	B
now sometimes we ride and sometimes um we pull- we like to to a lot of times just walk for the exercise	3746	B
but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better and i think it's because_1 i don't get as tired	3746	B
yeah	3746	B
i know and that makes me so mad i you know it's like it's not gonna do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently	3746	B
yeah	3746	B
right	3746	B
right well the reason why we play over there is because_1 since we're a Garland resident they give us a special deal where you can get um ten rounds of golf for	3746	B
a hundred dollar yeah a hundred dollars because_1 it's half price what the normal green fees are	3746	B
so that's why we you know play over there because_1 we've got our card	3746	B
oh do you so you live in Garland then	3746	B
okay well we're in south Garland but yeah next time you go um	3746	B
you know check into it they've uh it's just like uh a bus card and they just punch it you know it's got	3746	B
one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you	3746	B
oh okay	3746	B
you must have a a son	3746	B
oh okay	3746	B
yeah oh well that sounds like fun too	3746	B
uh-huh well you need to teach them how to play take them out on the course with you	3746	B
oh yeah well you can teach them_1	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
right right	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
uh-huh right	3746	B
right	3746	B
right	3746	B
yeah i know what you mean	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
oh yeah it's it's just nice to get outdoors and do something	3746	B
well flower gardens i like to have matter fact this past weekend i- i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs	3746	B
so those ought to be coming up around spring time	3746	B
uh-huh	3746	B
right	3746	B
oh they do great i put mine in probably in November	3746	B
and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later i didn't do anything to them_1 so they're um	3746	B
they're they're good to plant in the winter time	3746	B
because_1 they last for a long time then	3746	B
so if you start putting them_1 you know you can put them_1 out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them_1 because they can't stand the hot weather	3746	B
no they won't make it through the summer because_1 it gets too hot	3746	B
but they'd make it through probably winter and spring	3746	B
so	3746	B
yeah i've got some of those too i love flowers	3746	B
yeah	3746	B
and i do some i try to do some arts and crafts and i love to go the to	3746	B
okay um what kind of hobbies do you have Lori	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
uh-huh where do you play golf or in this area	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
do you uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf	3746	A
i was gonna say that could be difficult	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
i think that might be true	3746	A
i don't like pulling a cart on Firewheel- golf course because_1 they want you to pull the cart on the path	3746	A
that's the reason i don't play over there	3746	A
i like the course but i don't play over there because	3746	A
you they don't uh you know don't allow you to pull a cart	3746	A
and i don't think a cart damages the turf	3746	A
uh-huh	3746	A
well i guess i could use a car too i live uh very near very close to the Firewheel Golf Course	3746	A
yes i live in northwest Garland right up there near the golf course in fact	3746	A
well in the last two years i haven't played very much golf because i'm involved in Boy Scouts	3746	A
so i have uh i have children i have children Boy Scout age i have two boys that are Boy Scout age and so	3746	A
i'm very active in Boy Scouts so i'd have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby	3746	A
but i -like	3746	A
but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them_1 again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it's gonna probably be six to eight years before they go to college	3746	A
so	3746	A
that's right lessons are expensive though	3746	A
well they probably would never make it then because i don't i think i only took lessons for golf when i was in college	3746	A
ah as a course for P E you know so i could graduate	3746	A
but uh that's the only time i think i've ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual	3746	A
i took one lesson one other time besides that um i just uh try to make the club hit the ball	3746	A
i don't wanna play strike out you know	3746	A
but i have fun doing it some you know have some good shots and some bad shots	3746	A
so you said you work uh in the gardens too do you have ah special flowers	3746	A
my wife had uh	3746	A
just put in a bunch of i wanna say they're pansies	3746	A
she put them_1 in like two months ago because they're winter plants	3746	A
and they just bloom- with all- even with all the cold weather weather we've had they've been blooming just fine	3746	A
that's when she did i think	3746	A
um-hum	3746	A
do they survive longer if you put them_1 in the winter time will they make it through the summer some	3746	A
um-hum	3746	A
well	3746	A
oh that's good	3746	A
oh	3734	B
uh-huh	3734	B
uh-huh	3734	B
yeah uh	3734	B
ah	3734	B
oh me neither	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
yeah same here i don't mind not wearing any makeup	3734	B
um i work at a bakery because_1 i'm a still a a college student um	3734	B
but we we have to wear white pants and um	3734	B
any color T shirt as long as it's not like a bright color like a pastel	3734	B
yeah yeah the bakers wear all white and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back and so	3734	B
Cullentini's	3734	B
yeah it's Italian bakery and uh so	3734	B
i don't mind having having to wear a uniform because_1 i don't have to buy you know	3734	B
yeah isn't that yeah many clothes	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
i know i do that every day for school	3734	B
yeah but i- i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
yeah i know i don't have very many dress clothes but i don't mind i don't need them_1 yet	3734	B
oh really	3734	B
oh	3734	B
oh	3734	B
hum	3734	B
oh wow i love shoes i always buy shoes yeah	3734	B
uh-huh	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
oh	3734	B
i like the look the the like suit look professional like you know look but	3734	B
um i'm gonna be a teacher so i'll probably just wear uh casual clothes maybe skirts and some-	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
yeah that is cute	3734	B
yeah i'm five three and	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
oh really	3734	B
oh	3734	B
i like the like stretch pants the cotton ones they're really comfortable with a baggy sweatshirt	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
oh	3734	B
oh yeah i have a pair of those yeah	3734	B
yeah	3734	B
oh yeah	3734	B
oh	3734	B
my parents keep the house cold	3734	B
okay uh clothing at work	3734	A
um i work as a news reporter and a lot of i work in a since i work in a small station this is my first job and so	3734	A
i dress very variedly if that's a word um sometimes i'm shooting and doing photography and so i'll be in jeans one day and	3734	A
another day i'll be on camera and so i'll be in a suit and another day	3734	A
i'll come in and i won't know what i'm doing so i'll wear a pant suit in case i have to shoot	3734	A
so it really varies i try to dress very comfortably i don't really like dressing up at all	3734	A
i don't i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that i just i don't know it just it takes too much time out of my day and i don't i don't know	3734	A
yeah i don't mind it at all	3734	A
i	3734	A
um-hum	3734	A
okay	3734	A
white pants in a bakery	3734	A
wow	3734	A
okay	3734	A
what's the name of the bakery	3734	A
oh Italian i guess	3734	A
new clothes and stuff-	3734	A
yeah that's one thing i would like is just to sort of have i'd i really don't like uniforms	3734	A
but just to	3734	A
have something where i don't have to get up and decide what to wear because_1 that just bugs me to death	3734	A
oh	3734	A
oh yeah	3734	A
and sweats and things yeah when i was in school i was sweat monster i mean that's all i had was sweats and when it time to go out i didn't have anything to wear	3734	A
yeah	3734	A
yeah	3734	A
hum	3734	A
i hate shoes	3734	A
i just i don't know my feet bother me and	3734	A
they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just i don't know i wear a size nine	3734	A
and it i don't know it's just the shoes i get i really- either don't like them_1 or they don't fit right and i just wish that i could just go without them_1	3734	A
oh really oh	3734	A
just the opposite	3734	A
but um	3734	A
let's see what else do i wear	3734	A
um if i were in a bigger market when i do get into a bigger market i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and	3734	A
uh where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things and i could then i would be able to dress	3734	A
more business like and things like that but	3734	A
we're all kind of just out of school at this station and so we're all you know	3734	A
still in sweats really so it's pretty fun though	3734	A
um-hum	3734	A
yeah i like	3734	A
yeah	3734	A
um-hum	3734	A
i like this the uh suits with the they come like with a mini type skirt	3734	A
you know and the jacket i like that but	3734	A
but i'm pretty short i'm five four and so that really doesn't flatter me but i think it looks good on taller people	3734	A
are you yeah anytime i go to the store i mean i i have like two pairs of pants because i can never find any that are short enough for me	3734	A
and it's just oh ridiculous pants too i could do without those pants and shoes	3734	A
yeah those are nice those are nice yeah	3734	A
yeah those are nice	3734	A
and	3734	A
tennis shoes my boyfriend's got me these	3734	A

okay_1	3703	A
um we have small children two and four and so we our dining is very limited oh we're past that now we're a little sick of that	3703	A
no um	3703	A
we're more like um you know like Wyatt's Cafeteria	3703	A
yeah that way and the kids just love everything that's there so we're pretty fortunate kind of um buffet style um so you can go in and go out and the food's already served and you don't have to wait and	3703	A
and it's already in front of them when you sit down and things like um Super Salads you know it's again it's buffet and	3703	A
it's already prepared and just things any any eating area that you just don't have to wait uh an extreme amount of time	3703	A
we	3703	A
no	3703	A
we tried a Bennigan's one time and it was terrible course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyways we we waited almost oh forty five minutes before everything was brought out and it was we were ready to go home	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
no we fought with them_1 for forty five minutes	3703	A
yeah so we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more but we do love to eat out and um	3703	A
and we do it as often as we can and and times that we do have baby sitters we we try and catch um some things that we normally wouldn't do yeah	3703	A
oh um let me see uh for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's	3703	A
it's um	3703	A
on Walnut and Greenville	3703	A
it's called Uncle Julio's	3703	A
um basically Mexican food and it's supposed to be very similar to um uh what is that restaurant off of Central it's a	3703	A
um it's a Mexican restaurant off of Central like	3703	A
no but i've heard about it	3703	A

oh really	3703	A
oh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
really and where is that	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
really	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
yeah well my birthday's coming up so	3703	A
i need an excuse	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
uh-huh	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
oh	3703	A
yeah	3703	A
right yeah i certainly did	3764	B
uh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
well uh uh about the same i dress for school i uh i i'm a graduate- i'm a graduate student so i don't have to worry too much about uh what i wear too much of the time	3764	B
uh which is nice uh uh i've uh although i do uh a lot of i'm a speech pathology major and so i do a lot of clinical work and when i do clinic work then i have to uh uh look my best	3764	B
yeah unfortunately	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
yeah sure	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah yeah uh do- uh do you find that uh on the average do people give uh more credibility or less credibility to a to a professional to professionally- professionally dressed individual	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
oh really	3764	B
even- even the farmers oh wow	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah certainly	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
uh-huh yeah it depends sure uh so you don't you uh if you had the choice would you wear a tie or no	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
right right	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah that uh	3764	B
that's uh if if you wanted to to uh really get into a hot issue uh well at least in some in some beliefs uh uh how people dress when they go to church is uh is uh sometimes a pretty pretty hot topic	3764	B
uh unfortunately- unfortunately- unfortunately- unfortunately	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh-huh uh yeah i'm i'm a i- i go to the Church of Christ i've been raised in Church of Christ and uh i- i uh	3764	B
too many times you you hear you hear a lot about what- what you're uh supposed you're supposed to look your your Sunday best and uh uh dress in proper attire and uh and sometimes that really disappoints me uh in	3764	B
in uh	3764	B
when i see in other economic areas uh like in Kentucky	3764	B
uh you know people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because_1 they don't have the clothes to wear	3764	B
uh-huh	3764	B
yeah	3764	B
certainly	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
um-hum	3764	B
uh yeah a little bit uh course in the summer if i can get away with it i wear uh uh a pair of shorts and that's it run around barefoot no shirt or anything uh but uh	3764	B
i guess you heard our conversation- our topic for today was clothing	3764	A
how you dress for work and season to season and everything	3764	A
how do you dress for work	3764	A
sure	3764	A
you bet	3764	A
look professional	3764	A
yeah i understand i'm a i own my own company i'm in the i'm a manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i'm very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt things like that	3764	A
but then when i travel it's a little different situation it's uh suit and sports coat tie and the whole bit because_1 you go to meetings and you're required to look your best and look professional of course	3764	A
yeah i think in today's society uh there's more credibility quite honest	3764	A
i'll always remember i'll tell this real quick story when i graduated college my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty- twenty nine years ago in fact was selling uh agricultural fertilizer	3764	A
i worked for the uh Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and i sold uh you know manure	3764	A
and uh i would go out and call on farmers and	3764	A
i was always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls and so	3764	A
one day i got up and thought well i'll just go casual and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional	3764	A
and uh he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so uh it was sort of was	3764	A
you bet even even back then so i've sort a uh	3764	A
been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best but but here again i dress casual quite a bit so	3764	A
it depends on who you call on in my business if i call on the the JC Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then i wear coat and tie if i call on just uh a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual	3764	A
i call on Oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie so it just it it depends	3764	A
um	3764	A
probably no	3764	A
probably no	3764	A
because uh	3764	A
today i believe you can get away with it but then it depends on who you're calling on who you're it'd be like your your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he'd be missing something although he shouldn't be evaluated on that	3764	A
so it is it's it's just different	3764	A
yes it is	3764	A
i'm uh lightly a Catholic and the people uh that go to my church are you know the Catholics dress very casual you're liable to find	3764	A
people in jeans and and and whatever but yet the way i was raised i'm a converted Catholic the way i was raised i was raised a Baptist and	3764	A
it seems like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time but i guess that has changed also	3764	A
right	3764	A
sure	3764	A
but at the very-	3764	A
that's a very good point i'm from West Virginia so i understand what you're saying there and there it's it's just a very good point	3764	A
but uh you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover	3764	A
and uh evaluation of of an individual of course i think it depends on the type of job responsibility you have i think you have to dress sort of accordingly	3764	A
but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that	3764	A
but what about season to season does i guess your dress changes	3764	A
my voting experience	3788	B
i- i well personally i've been very diligent until recent years	3788	B
when i felt my vote was absolutely	3788	B
kind of washed down the drain	3788	B
for the issues that you know that i felt really strong for um	3788	B
i think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run	3788	B
you really do have to study to get yourself um up to par with	3788	B
what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research and and people today are very busy	3788	B
and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh involved- i know i'm heavenly involved in other things	3788	B
and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i don't have the time to devote to that	3788	B
and uh	3788	B
you hopefully -will find	3788	B
that	3788	B
you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard and unfortunately they are not	3788	B
and uh it's really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in i believe um	3788	B
so i kind of just have taken a back step away and uh	3788	B
hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there	3788	B
take it it- because it is a task that is	3788	B
to me kind of overwhelming	3788	B
yeah	3788	B
yes	3788	B
well i know that when you're in a smaller community i live in Mesquite and uh	3788	B
when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth	3788	B
they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper i mean they	3788	B
they just give it a small portion of the newspaper but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate	3788	B
and uh and then they have they raise a	3788	B
they raise two sides and uh there's a pro and a con side and uh you can really um	3788	B
feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method	3788	B
uh i feel pretty confident about	3788	B
the way it's put forth now i wouldn't say that about the larger cities though and the and the country uh like the presidential	3788	B
uh i mean they've got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted crooks you know i'm sorry but	3788	B
i don't believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf	3788	B
unless they have the Lord that has done that to them_1	3788	B
and uh without the Lord they can't do it	3788	B
and i have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet and although i did go down and register and i that's the first time i've ever done that has- what's been your voting experience	3788	A
well do you feel like uh i mean i	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
uh-huh	3788	A
yes	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
that's really true that's kind of the way that i have felt it i also feel guilty um not	3788	A
knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates course we only have mostly the representation given in the media	3788	A
but um i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known	3788	A
what the issues were and that i because_1 it was a new community	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
it does	3788	A
yeah	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
no	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
no	3788	A
right	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
yes and uh	3788	A
and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and	3788	A
or that and that you don't necessarily your vote doesn't necessarily	3788	A
elect a president	3788	A
right and it's kind of it's awful and and it's hard to feel like one person but i know that it's important	3788	A
and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time and i know that you know people can make a difference but it's hard to	3788	A
to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you're up against	3788	A
and it makes me feel bad that	3788	A
i'm glad i mean i am thankful for the uh nineteenth amendment that it gives women the right to vote and uh	3788	A
i'm glad that that happened	3788	A
and everything and i hope that i will become	3788	A
a better	3788	A
make a better difference in	3788	A
but i haven't done that so far	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
right	3788	A
right right	3788	A
um-hum	3788	A
right	3788	A
yeah and it's not very likely i mean it seems like	3788	A
their-	3788	A
uh what is the last home repair that you did	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
oh	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
well uh repaired the back fence it's uh well of course they get old you know after about ten years anyway but uh	3700	A
yeah the the street- the alley's on a kind of a slant	3700	A
and it makes all the fences tilt or or slowly you know	3700	A
yeah somewhat right	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
um had to replace the the ridge row the shingles on the corners of the the roof from all the storms and everything	3700	A
and uh	3700	A
right yeah	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
weather proofing and	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
uh-huh	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
what's uh	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
right	3700	A
and then that it's that it's that white paint i've forgotten what it's called Tight Bond or something like that and those bricks are very porous	3700	A
and it soaks in to those bricks really well and it seals all the water out	3700	A
just a little bit	3700	A
yeah they use it all the time	3700	A
yeah it seals the water out	3700	A
right	3700	A
uh-huh	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
right	3700	A
yeah i'm from Dallas	3700	A
but uh	3700	A
uh-huh	3700	A
right	3700	A
um um-hum	3700	A
yeah and it's set into the earth so	3700	A
um-hum	3700	A
right uh-huh	3700	A
yeah	3700	A
oh gosh i'm trying to think well i guess ours have mostly been down at our lake house we built a house- built a house down on Cedar Creek Lake	3700	B
so	3700	B
so we had a shell built and then we did everything else	3700	B
so it was quite a bit of work	3700	B
what have you done	3700	B
oh yeah ours is nineteen years old	3700	B
uh-huh	3700	B
oh do you have to have like a retaining wall or	3700	B
yeah that makes them_1 more difficult we we've just my husband has just um repaired- repaired ours a lot it really needs to be replaced but we haven't done it	3700	B
but uh	3700	B
anyway well have you done anything else	3700	B
um-hum um-hum	3700	B
yeah	3700	B
i haven't	3700	B
done those things and of course	3700	B
you know inside stuff	3700	B
but um	3700	B
now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in	3700	B
wall and you know do the painting and the	3700	B
uh cut and make the like the	3700	B
uh window sills and	3700	B
things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we we did quite a bit	3700	B
uh down there that i had never done or we haven't done that much in our own house	3700	B
yeah yeah uh we do have- still have a problem down there we built us a two story house and the bottom story uh oh it's more like a walk out basement	3700	B
and when- it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think they're called Hadite blocks	3700	B
and uh we found now with some as much rain as we've had the past year it seeps through	3700	B
and uh so now we have bought some uh	3700	B
uh	3700	B
water proofing paint	3700	B
and that's our next project the next time we go down there we've got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it	3700	B
but what they should've done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before they put the dirt back you know when it was built	3700	B
and uh they didn't do that didn't think they'd need to	3700	B
yeah	3700	B
oh have you ever used that anywhere	3700	B
now people up north that have basements i think	3700	B
you and do you know if it if they've had good luck with it	3700	B
we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a store and they say oh well that we don't have anything like that you know	3700	B
and then finally we found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the North	3700	B
and well that's encouraging then because i haven't known that many you know there's just not many basements down here are you from around here	3700	B
oh okay well we're from you know Texas too so	3700	B
uh but i we have a partner in this deal and he's from the North so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space	3700	B
and toward the lake it looks like a two story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a one story house you know	3700	B
uh-huh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know	3700	B
so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money	3700	B
but we always	3700	B
yeah i do i have a like a seven and a half year old dog	3792	B
and he's kind of a big Benji long hair and he's white and he's the baby of the house	3792	B
and tonight he has a friend visiting who's a pit bull so they're kind of running around chewing on things	3792	B
uh we have a child but he's like twenty so he's not like a chip you know like a little kid anymore	3792	B
and uh	3792	B
why well actually we bought him for my son's thirteenth birthday and he's just been with us ever since and uh	3792	B
we spend more on him on his haircuts and medical attention than we do ourselves	3792	B
and that's what pets are like	3792	B
but he's like uh you got to have him when you come home and there's nobody here he's always here and	3792	B
so it's nice nice to have him there	3792	B
what about you how come you don't have a pet	3792	B
um-hum	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
yeah we were talking earlier tonight one of the ladies that's visiting with us tonight	3792	B
her dog is her life	3792	B
but uh yeah	3792	B
oh yeah uh	3792	B
it's just	3792	B
i know our dog takes a nap everyday with my wife and he jumps right up in the bed and the whole bit	3792	B
it's just when we first got him we didn't like dogs around the house or in the house and	3792	B
but now we put up with about anything	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
yeah it it- it's if like now you have to vacuum three or four times a week and it just i we didn't used to have to do that but uh	3792	B
but uh	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
we were kind of timid about it and- because_1 we'd we'd all- we'd all had dogs as kids and lost them_1 or something and and we do- we were afraid to but he kind of rooted his way in	3792	B
and -hey i know at times when he's had emergency problems we're just a nervous wreck	3792	B
so that's that's part of being a pet owner these days	3792	B
and i don't know but cats i don't know you can have a cat in the apartment couldn't you	3792	B
oh	3792	B
yeah	3792	B
um we never had much luck with cats we had some when we lived in New Mexico and coyotes ate them_1 so	3792	B
we were kind of timid about having cats and again plus we we found out that when they were kittens we really liked them_1 and as they got older they kind of ignored us	3792	B
so	3792	B
but with a dog they don't do that	3792	B
when i was a kid i i raised parakeets	3792	B
so those were i always thought those were good pets to have extremely messy but	3792	B
yeah they're- they're fun but i like to look at fish one of our favorite restaurants here in town	3792	B
has a humongous fish tank and i like to go there just uh the food's not that great but a fish tank's wonderful to look at them_1 you know floating around	3792	B
matter fact we got two dogs fighting right now yeah	3792	B
yeah -well there's enough people here actually the pit bull is from Dallas he lives up he lives up there but they're down visiting and	3792	B
so it's kind of unusual to have two dogs in the house	3792	B
well you have do you have any pets	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
hm	3792	A
uh-huh yeah do you have any children or	3792	A
oh okay i see yeah	3792	A
uh-huh so whether um why do you have a dog what uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
yeah uh-huh	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
well mainly because it's just uh at this point in life i've had to be available to travel and we live in an apartment right now so um they're not even allowed here	3792	A
but uh when i was growing up i always had cats and and then um	3792	A
later i guess uh the last few years that i was at home my mother and father got a dog and i learned to really appreciate dogs as well they're totally different types of pets but um	3792	A
i see how dogs are really faithful friends and	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
okay yeah that's true yeah my dad i think uh finds that he really enjoys his dog he says he's the best friend he has but uh	3792	A
i don't know that's kind of sad though	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
um-hum yeah well i've seen that there's there's a lot of um you really have to appreciate their good qualities because there there are problems yeah they leave a lot of hair around and	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah but obviously you find him worth it or you'd get rid of him	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
isn't it-	3792	A
well not this one i it's not allowed here but	3792	A
yeah the thing i like about cats is they're more independent you can leave them and they can take better care of themselves than a dog it seems like you know depends	3792	A
oh wow yeah	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah they'll do that sometimes	3792	A
so	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
oh really uh-huh	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah yeah oh i had goldfish but i didn't think much of those they were they don't have any personality	3792	A
so	3792	A
um-hum	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
yeah	3792	A
do you well maybe i better let you go and go solve the conflict there	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
oh really uh-huh	3792	A
uh-huh	3792	A
yeah i think that's what's called a moot question	3714	B
yeah the the	3714	B
i think that had we had the war or had we not had the war we'd a had a lot similar uh effect upon the population in terms of the the freedom era as it were	3714	B
i think what we saw was a phenomenon of a large number of young people at one time that were of the age of decision without the maturity to handle it	3714	B
me among them	3714	B
and uh you know Richard Nixon is my hero because he kept me out of that place	3714	B
and my number was six i was going yeah and	3714	B
yeah	3714	B
yeah forget that you're not going	3714	B
well i quit college when uh they when they moved out	3714	B
went into construction	3714	B
took me seventeen years to finish my degree	3714	B
is it was it worth while from who's point of view	3714	B
well i think one of the the major points that a lot of people including myself missed until recently is the fact that	3714	B
we could have annihilated	3714	B
the north had we wanted to	3714	B
well even even at even at the not on the you know the gross tactical but on the on the very minute tactical arena	3714	B
you know they were sending out you know eight or nine guys to engage a company	3714	B
you know and they'd get wiped out you wonder why you know and	3714	B
at every turn the tacticians were denied access to information which is a biggie and uh components you know whatever it took to do the job by the politicians	3714	B
why because somebody was getting rich i found that everywhere you look if you find the money you'll find out why	3714	B
and Dow Chemical had a real good thing going you know Dow Chemical had a photographer at every demonstration	3714	B
yes and if your picture was in that demonstration you didn't get hired by Dow Chemical	3714	B
yeah	3714	B
and uh DuPont was was uh doing a lot of that too	3714	B
yeah	3714	B
well it's a big part of their market	3714	B
you know in the	3714	B
they have no moral conscience	3714	B
and that goes into and it and it's all tied together too i kind of believe that the Vietnam event i'm not gonna call it a war or a police action it was an event	3714	B
that the main	3714	B
push for that was outside the United States our involvement for one thing we were on the wrong side	3714	B
you know we were on the side of the fascist dictator and you know Ho Chi Minh if you've read any of his writings he was a democrat	3714	B
you know he wanted democracy	3714	B
but he was forced to sleep with	3714	B
yeah they they asked us um you know whether we felt the uh the war was was justified in dollars and lives and	3714	A
i mean i- i really can't uh see how it was i think the more interesting part of the question to me was the effect that it had on uh on the US	3714	A
you	3714	A
yeah real- good point but i was thinking- you know i was while i was waiting for a connection i was just thinking about it i said you know the	3714	A
i don't know if without the Vietnam War if we would have had you know all the hippie era the protestors demonstrations um	3714	A
you know and the the effect that it had on Rock and Roll and you know all of the uh the baby boomers i mean i- i think it you know has a profound effect on all of us	3714	A
right	3714	A
right	3714	A
yeah yeah likewise likewise	3714	A
wow	3714	A
oh well see my my uh the the	3714	A
i had uh i had forgot i hadn't even thought about that in a long long time i had two numbers the lowest one i had was like a a sixty eight i think and then another one uh i had like a one thirty seven i think you know	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
well um i don't know it's uh	3714	A
well i think that i think what it showed though was that uh you you know America was was is- is not invincible and all powerful and uh you- you know it it also shows that	3714	A
even with the the kind of money that was thrown into it and the the uh	3714	A
uh armaments uh with the way it was waged which was not an all out war and i guess that's the other thing too it was never a declared war so you you know it never did really have the backing of the people	3714	A
oh and i agree with that but it was uh it was such a uh a a limited uh you know one hand tied behind your back uh	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
right	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
why why was that	3714	A
yeah	3714	A
yeah good point	3714	A
oh really	3714	A
really how interesting	3714	A
yeah DuPont is um they're they're not high on my list of favorites they uh they fought uh the banning of ozone uh or rather um not ozone but uh freon just tooth and nail	3714	A
oh right right but i mean you know they they took uh you know all the data that had been uh produced uh from back uh in the late uh eighties middle mid to late eighties about uh	3714	A
uh how freon was uh shown to to damage the ozone and uh they just you know were adamant that uh you know and- and	3714	A
yeah really	3714	A
hum	3714	A
really	3714	A
any vacations recently that you would highly recommend	3711	A
oh really	3711	A
oh wow	3711	A
wow	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
uh what what has been your favorite trip do you think	3711	A
really better than Europe	3711	A
oh	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
sure	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
yeah	3711	A
well uh i have never been i've been to Canada several times but uh that is about it for me i'm i'm from a Denver and so uh growing up uh we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado	3711	A
uh my family is uh uh real into camping and four wheeling and so um several i- i think maybe uh four summers in a row	3711	A
uh we spent uh our vacation time in the summer uh four wheeling through uh portions of uh the southern half of of Colorado uh and	3711	A
and uh every time uh my mother had uh uh i have two other sisters and my mother had us uh do some studying of the the area which we were going to visit and then we had to write uh	3711	A
uh reports reports about it during during our vacation- which which was really fun it was really fun we we we each got to write little books uh	3711	A
and uh it- it had sparked an interest that uh uh of of mine that uh my fiancee is a is a um very very good photographer that's what she had originally gone to school to do was photography and uh	3711	A
i i'm close to receiving my English degree uh as as well as my my graduate degree so so i uh	3711	A
uh we've thought very seriously of trying to to uh incorporate travel into writing- and and writing a book about uh uh some portion of travel	3711	A
uh so we're hoping soon uh not soon maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over from uh over over to Europe and take a trip from the northern portion of France	3711	A
uh down to the southern tip of Spain uh and follow uh it there's kind of a backward S shape uh	3711	A
trail that the pilgrims use to take uh in in uh back in the medieval times uh to see the relics uh in in Southern Spain and in Italy	3711	A
and so we would like to take pictures of the Gothic uh and Romanesque uh monasteries and uh just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it	3711	A
yeah it would be it's it's our big dream	3711	A
oh sure- really	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
oh	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
wow	3711	A
uh-huh	3711	A
right	3711	A
um-hum	3711	A
oh	3711	A
yeah yeah	3711	A
yeah	3711	A
you said you've been to England several times	3711	A
i wonder have you ever been to a uh a small town uh well it's it's actually about uh thirty minutes from Salisbury it's called uh Bemerton	3711	A
okay	3711	A
oh okay all right yeah i- i- i the reason i'm curious um i uh that's the other place i would like to visit uh most-	3711	A
well	3711	B
that is like my favorite hobby so yeah i travel everywhere and i've been all over Europe and	3711	B
a lot of the United States and Hawaii and	3711	B
so when i can that's what i do	3711	B
well i'm not sure um i guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places	3711	B
yeah	3711	B
well no that's exciting you know i've been several times so after the first time it's like anywhere you know it loses that newness but	3711	B
yeah i love it i love to go over to Europe i do and mostly i've traveled through Germany and Switzerland and	3711	B
we have good friends in England so i've been there quite a bit and i just love it all i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different things are from the way we do them	3711	B
the most interesting part more than the museums and things like that	3711	B
so how about_1 you	3711	B
uh-huh	3711	B
oh no	3711	B
um-hum	3711	B
um-hum	3711	B
um-hum	3711	B
uh-huh	3711	B
boy that would be quite a project	3711	B
yeah	3711	B
well it would be a lot fun you know there's there's good and there's bad and my experience in Italy wasn't my favorite for sure but	3711	B
well i flew into Milan my daughter is uh a twirling champion	3711	B
and she had to perform over there and in Turin and so we had to fly into Milan and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians even if they speak English they don't wanna let you know	3711	B
and they gave us all the wrong directions and there were just two of us at the airport they put us on the wrong bus but finally we saw a policeman he put us on the subway we sat there um	3711	B
and we lucked out and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground i mean it was just it was kind of a nightmare but that was our experience and i guess all of Italy isn't like that	3711	B
but where we were it certainly was and the hotel that we stayed in we stayed with our English friends their team in the hotel and it was beautiful it was very modern	3711	B
but it was very far away on a bus so you know it was it was really uh it was interesting you always learn something	3711	B
and you will always have a fun experience so it it's great you know	3711	B
uh-huh	3711	B
no i haven't huh-uh our friends live like an hour outside of England like Ash around there so um-hum	3711	B
okay have you ever	3725	B
probably once every five years	3725	B
um-hum	3725	B
yeah and the hardest part about getting the family- the stuff together is everyone's spread out all over Timbuktu	3725	B
and you	3725	B
um-hum	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
yeah see that's kind of what happened with ours that's why we hadn't had one in a long time	3725	B
so so to make one successful what- i mean what do y'all do do y'all just start planning real far ahead of time	3725	B
do- you- um do y'all start planning real far ahead of time	3725	B
oh really	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
eat a lot see it's a lot harder for us because we're like i say we're spread out so they have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so everyone can say- um	3725	B
their their vacation time	3725	B
um-hum	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
now is that where you're i mean is	3725	B
but y'all still manage to make them_1	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
you can't really get away	3725	B
well now that we've been talking about it i'm -gonna i'm kind of getting home sick now because_1 it's been over three years since i've been home	3725	B
to see my grandparents or well my my grandfather's the only one that's still around	3725	B
and see my grandmother was the one that used to plan the stuff basically	3725	B
so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it's kind of like she was like the glue so	3725	B
originally um i was born in Missouri	3725	B
so and you know we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana Mississippi	3725	B
um here in Texas so it's harder for everyone to get in get home	3725	B
now- well but see the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters so it's easier for us few stragglers to go home	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
well-	3725	B
well- um how do y'all communicate like to plan it and everything do y'all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we're gonna do it or do y'all like mail out stuff	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
well- um	3725	B
i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i hadn't seen in probably ten over ten years it was like don't you remember me and i'm like no	3725	B
yeah i know	3725	B
do you i mean is that since you- i mean do you have them_1 every year	3725	B
well- see it's probably not that	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
well- i think that's probably why our's always so interesting is because we don't have them_1 that often and then when we do	3725	B
and everyone does finally get together it's like after the you know the just like	3725	B
yeah	3725	B
your family have reunions on any regular basis	3725	A
once every five years	3725	A
yeah um you have a pretty big family	3725	A
oh yeah	3725	A
yeah we've got a pretty big family but most of us live- well i'm well- i'm originally from West Virginia	3725	A
most of the family is right in the West Virginia area- uh what they call the Tristate area uh northern West Virginia Eastern Ohio and Southwestern- Southwestern Pennsylvania	3725	A
most everybody is right in that area	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah they put one together for our family about once every June it was on my grandmother's birthday but she's	3725	A
she's gone now	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
um	3725	A
oh shoot	3725	A
pardon	3725	A
well no there's kind of a set pattern to it there's uh so the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually	3725	A
yeah oh the we get together at the the uh the park uh	3725	A
the uh	3725	A
park and playground area of the church i was raised in	3725	A
and uh	3725	A
everybody brings lots of food and	3725	A
we'll put up a volleyball net	3725	A
just sit around and tell stories and catch up and	3725	A
play volleyball all day and get really fat	3725	A
oh goodness	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
scheduled vacation time	3725	A
yeah we usually just Saturday- Saturday- uh Sunday afternoon	3725	A
or maybe- sometimes it's been like on Saturday afternoon usually it's like Sunday afternoon and most people don't have more than you know a couple hours drive tops to get there and back	3725	A
well where i'm calling from is southern Mississippi so we got a ways- uh uh my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most	3725	A
uh actually we've only made one of them_1 since we got married about four years ago one of the family reunions but we're both in school so it makes it kind of tough	3725	A
they usually they been happening um	3725	A
just after the summer semester starts	3725	A
so usually not we managed to get to one that was before i started to school and she took that summer off	3725	A
but uh	3725	A
oh	3725	A
yeah- oh goodness	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah i understand	3725	A
where is home for you	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah -well maybe this year you can find a more central location	3725	A
oh okay okay the majority of them_1 are still in the Missouri area	3725	A
okay	3725	A
yeah our family right now or most there's- there's- there's only like- few stragglers	3725	A
uh if any with any distance -yeah some of us- -there's one cousin uh in Colorado and	3725	A
uh some cousins over in Phoenix	3725	A
uh i got a sister over in in uh	3725	A
Washington state	3725	A
uh rest of them_1 are within you know a couple hours drive	3725	A
that's pretty much it yeah okay it's gonna be such and such a weekend and uh y'all come that's about it	3725	A
i mean you know this is the standard pattern is the	3725	A
everybody brings their their favorite dish and	3725	A
somebody brings the volleyball net somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon and	3725	A
am i related to you yeah i married your cousin's brother's uncle uh something like that	3725	A
uh yeah they're every year and and still you wind up meeting people you- you- you never knew you were related to let alone	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
yeah	3725	A
down right amazing isn't it	3725	A
um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it	3745	A
um	3745	A
well i that's funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids and um i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools	3745	A
so i know a little bit about it not a whole great deal	3745	A
well um there there's some there's several it's such a a broad	3745	A
you know topic that you- you- you need to boil it down but um one that um	3745	A
i thought was a problem that it's a it i thought it was a serious problem that i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education	3745	A
for um different um minority groups and like Asians and um uh Mexican Americans and and just people in general that speak other languages that	3745	A
sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area and	3745	A
um as the school district i'm not sure how to go about it because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these language and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program	3745	A
and then for just a small amount of time and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the part of the day and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak	3745	A
English	3745	A
and so um a lot of the moneys isn't put into that and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and um	3745	A
you know it- there's only so long you can do that and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts and a lot of the teachers	3745	A
it not- it was not the teacher's fault a lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
yeah	3745	A
oh yeah oh definitely definitely and it and it teaches language too which is really good um	3745	A
uh-huh	3745	A
uh-huh	3745	A
yeah oh definitely yeah	3745	A
right right	3745	A
well i know Richardson school district has a has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where	3745	A
you know of course all the children are tested in some time at portion of the year and and uh	3745	A
some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program and it is just excellent it is i wish that	3745	A
all the children could be exposed to that program	3745	A
you know and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that and yet they don't qualify but unfortunate that they don't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs	3745	A
it is excellent so	3745	A
i have two little ones and that's why i i quit my job uh you know i've been teaching since they were gosh newborns and and it just wasn't adding up and you know	3745	A
being a teacher and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know don't have the time time time time it was kind of getting to me where well i'm doing the same thing	3745	A
and so um you know my children are getting older and i was missing out on a lot so i just decided to stay home for a while i don't know how long as long-	3745	A
all right	3745	B
well what do you think	3745	B
oh	3745	B
well tell me about it what are what are the problems with public education	3745	B
uh-huh	3745	B
uh-huh	3745	B
right	3745	B
um-hum	3745	B
right	3745	B
do you find that those parents um	3745	B
i've seen the same thing and heard the same things and at the same time i've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend	3745	B
you know that that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh the children and and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on and really society sort of dictates that uh	3745	B
you know both the parents work and- and um	3745	B
i know i've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that that would make a lot of difference	3745	B
yeah	3745	B
well i work at a university and and it's really tough when we're uh uh i i uh work at the University of Texas at Dallas and	3745	B
uh we have uh some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen	3745	B
and you know there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class even some who are maybe	3745	B
you know in the top ten uh of their class and their S A T scores are very low and a lot of it has- has to do with their uh	3745	B
their reading ability you know their their language and-	3745	B
it uh makes it tough because when- when you know when they come in with scores that low	3745	B
they may be uh good students but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential and they're gonna fail unless some sort of remedial uh	3745	B
education is given to them so	3745	B
and then it then it comes into well who's supposed to give it to them the colleges and universities or	3745	B
are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and the junior highs	3745	B
yep	3745	B
yeah it sounds like it	3745	B
so how many children do you have at home	3745	B
oh	3745	B
yeah	3745	B
-well that's good what when-	3745	B
yeah i have	3749	B
i went to Western State College in Gunnison Colorado	3749	B
what about you	3749	B
oh okay	3749	B
i personally would recommend the smaller college just because	3749	B
you know you get a lot more	3749	B
individual attention and and you can go speak- talk to your professor and	3749	B
and uh it's just	3749	B
more i think it's more conducive to studying especially if you're like a freshman	3749	B
um-hum	3749	B
right	3749	B
right is that uh is that in the mountains	3749	B
oh great	3749	B
well that's the way that's what Western State was too	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
i wouldn't trade it i wish i could move back	3749	B
i'm tired of the big city that's for sure yeah	3749	B
yeah we're just uh uh out skirts of Dallas	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
did you ski	3749	B
right	3749	B
oh yeah definitely	3749	B
no	3749	B
i regret it too i- i really wanna	3749	B
i'd like to go this year	3749	B
we were supposed to go on a ski trip but that's one that's one thing i would recommend too because_1 you know	3749	B
most college- you go to a college and you make what you what you uh what you can out of it you know	3749	B
and when you get out then you know you're you basically promote yourself and you try and network into a company or or get a job or start a business or whatever	3749	B
but uh you just can't trade the	3749	B
the- the time you know that you spend in the mountains you know if you if you fish and hunt or whatever and ski	3749	B
you know i i'd never give up that	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
right	3749	B
sure	3749	B
right	3749	B
right	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
yeah they do	3749	B
that's right	3749	B
right	3749	B
uh business administration	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
emphasis in finance	3749	B
yeah	3749	B
really	3749	B
i'm at uh company by the name of E Systems we're a defense contractor down here	3749	B
it's it's pretty good company so	3749	B
yeah i'm a scheduling analyst yeah	3749	B
so	3749	B
oh really	3749	B
is there a lot of	3749	B
a lot of companies up there or	3749	B
uh-huh	3749	B
for what reason- how do they do that	3749	B
have you gone to college yourself	3749	A
did you where'd you go	3749	A
oh yeah	3749	A
uh i went- i graduated from ah Weaver State University here at in Ogden	3749	A
yeah so what did you uh or what would you recommend for a good college i guess	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
um-hum	3749	A
yeah i agree with you a hundred percent i Weaver's a pretty small college we have uh about ten thousand to twelve thousand students and	3749	A
i i have some friends who went to Brigham Young University and the the University of Utah that you know they got twenty five thirty thousand people and	3749	A
you know all they are is a number you go to a testing center for everything and you just check in by number or you most- all- most of the time they said they actually even had uh	3749	A
uh student or not student teacher but you know graduate students teaching their classes	3749	A
whereas you know all my professors i knew they were PhD's or whatever and that they were tenured and everything and felt like uh like like you say i got a lot more personal attention and	3749	A
uh yeah we are	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
oh yeah it's beautiful i i'd	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
are you	3749	A
are you close to Dallas or	3749	A
yeah uh we uh in fact my campus was right on uh the benches of the mountains	3749	A
so i was it was really pretty all the time	3749	A
sure enjoy i- i don't know if i could ever move away	3749	A
of course yeah you i- i haven't uh actually the last couple of years i haven't been able to as much because	3749	A
uh out of school but uh	3749	A
i i did a lot when i was in high school and stuff when i -didn't have to spend the time studying and working and supporting a family but	3749	A
i love it you yourself	3749	A
yeah you don't get as much of a chance down there in Texas do you i would think	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
go up to Colorado or	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
yeah	3749	A
um-hum	3749	A
yeah that's true	3749	A
um-hum	3749	A
oh yeah they offer i mean anymore they offer cook there's a you know we have uh we had a mountain climbing class we had you know we had a ski class	3749	A
and there was all kind of that stuff that was offered as you know electives and those were i mean those were the funniest ones i mean	3749	A
that made up for all the English classes or you know the science classes you had to take but uh	3749	A
yeah that was what made it like i say made it worthwhile and	3749	A
at least kept you going to school on a semi regular basis i know it was pretty tough come spring or in summer- or especially when it was so cold man if you didn't have a reason like a ski class you never went	3749	A
it just wasn't worth it so	3749	A
but yeah i uh	3749	A
i'm convinced that after getting me my undergraduate degree i would like to go to a big name school to get my graduate degree but	3749	A
they're so expensive i'm not anymore i i almost think people just require- they require a graduate degree or an undergraduate degree they don't necessarily care where from and you wanna set yourself apart you have to go get that big graduate degree from Harvard or some place like that	3749	A
or else it you know you're just Joe Blow off the street nobody knows but	3749	A
what'd you get your degree in	3749	A
oh did you did you have an emphasis in anything or	3749	A
oh did you that's what i got mine in was in finance yeah so where you're working at now	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
uh-huh	3749	A
oh really are you an analyst for them_1 or	3749	A
oh really great	3749	A
yeah i'm a little out of my field of what i wanna be i'm an auditor for a credit union but	3749	A
it's not something i wanna do for very long	3749	A
we're kind of the bad guys it's kind of a negative type thing but	3749	A
uh not- not a lot of private	3749	A
ah there i mean there's a lot of companies but they're not really large enough they're mainly there's a lot of family type companies and just small ten fifteen people	3749	A
we uh pretty much are	3749	A
you know the government plays a big part in our economy and	3749	A
well we got we have uh	3749	A
well i was just wondering if you had had any experience with um	3770	A
the care of the elderly	3770	A
uh-huh	3770	A
right	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
well that's nice	3770	A
no	3770	A
it's really sad	3770	A
it's really a sad situation	3770	A
and uh i think a lot of people struggle with	3770	A
uh i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is	3770	A
doesn't always want the in-law living in the house is that right	3770	A
well that's really sad	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
right	3770	A
yes well i know when the	3770	A
i remember being a child and my grandmother had had several- several strokes and things and that we had	3770	A
my parents tried to keep her in the house and they did for a long time i couldn't tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care	3770	A
and just- they couldn't you know keep her in the house anymore and it was really hard on everyone that she had to have you know twenty four hour a day care	3770	A
and i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house	3770	A
and that um they put her there and we all went just constantly until she died	3770	A
but it was very hard on everyone to see	3770	A
well- you know grandmother be like that	3770	A
and i don't know that you know i don't being so young i don't remember why	3770	A
you know what was why she had to go there	3770	A
um-hum well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way and that that they couldn't they found that they could not you know give her	3770	A
the hygienic care and everything that she needed	3770	A
no but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home i do remember the other patients there um	3770	A
being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone	3770	A
um-hum	3770	A
right	3770	A
right and i guess that's hard on people to give	3770	A
give up their lives if they're busy they don't you know it's easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes i guess	3770	A
if you can afford them_1	3770	A
but	3770	A
anyway well i'm glad it worked out good for your family	3770	A
yes i have in fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the Lord and we cared for her the last uh oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home	3770	B
aside from uh	3770	B
having to uh take her to the hospital	3770	B
and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital	3770	B
and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program	3770	B
and uh i as far as i'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home	3770	B
because uh she's around her own family- you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family the uh hospice program provides a	3770	B
hospital type bed well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera	3770	B
and it's all taken care of by by uh Medicare uh	3770	B
and uh it it's it's really neat uh and i you know i wouldn't i wouldn't banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse	3770	B
and that's that's what i basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse	3770	B
so that's	3770	B
pardon me	3770	B
uh-huh no	3770	B
oh	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
right	3770	B
yeah i know but uh in this case	3770	B
uh spouse and i uh	3770	B
are uh we're are are are uh united in this area because i guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh	3770	B
her parents	3770	B
uh their- their- their golden years to so	3770	B
this isn't like uh uh	3770	B
just one one uh instance in fact uh her uh	3770	B
uh experiences were were invaluable to me	3770	B
uh in fact i don't know if i could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this this case	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
oh okay	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
well maybe uh uh well as as you say the the care	3770	B
of of grandmother or was was to such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it	3770	B
oh boy yeah	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
uh-huh well then then there's almost then there's	3770	B
almost no no uh	3770	B
uh choice left to her then	3770	B
uh-huh	3770	B
right	3770	B
in fact just to just to sit and chat with them_1 for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is	3770	B
um-hum	3770	B
right	3770	B
and then and	3770	B
oh yeah it did and i was just praised- i just praised the Lord that that we were able to uh	3770	B
have uh	3770	B
uh be	3770	B
yeah right uh well i i think um uh oh	3790	B
i probably um i don't know watching my son's a big fan of uh of Washington	3790	B
and so uh for not- not having any other real real preference i guess	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
huh	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
yeah it's kind of kind of bad when they get blown out like	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
just out of curiosity what uh people up in Utah um who who do who do people generally cheer for who are- who are the close teams out there the California teams	3790	B
um-hum	3790	B
um-hum sure	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	B
right	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	B
hm	3790	B
yeah i mean in in Texas there's there's plenty you know there's a fair amount to choose from between the Cowboys and and the Oilers and so	3790	B
but	3790	B
yeah well	3790	B
um-hum	3790	B
used to be the Cowboys- i mean the Cowboys for- for- for so many years uh ended up	3790	B
essentially dominating or and and being so strong consistently and then the last few years being being just walked all over by everybody i mean they've they've lost a lot of fans	3790	B
i yeah yeah	3790	B
sure	3790	B
yeah they're they're obviously rebuilding quite pretty well and and stuff	3790	B
yeah i i didn't know how he was gonna make the transition into professional ball um	3790	B
you know it's one thing to be a real successful college coach now i i at least i imagine it is um you know and- and then	3790	B
it seem like it would be quite different to to be coaching pros	3790	B
yeah yeah	3790	B
and so uh you know i don't know i mean but it seems like it would you know you can't treat them_1 like they're kids and yet in a lot of senses still a lot of them_1 probably are	3790	B
yeah you would've you would've been one of those coaches with the soft styles yeah	3790	B
my- yeah my dad was actually a football coach so yeah in the junior junior college yeah	3790	B
i played played high school but i didn't didn't go beyond that	3790	B
yeah huh	3790	B
uh well i'm i didn't grow too big myself but	3790	B
a little bit more so yeah because i i'm here in Austin and we have uh UT Austin it's here and and uh	3790	B
you know they they look like they were big- you know they're kind of like the Cowboys i mean for years years had a dominating team then they went through this big long slump and and uh last year it looked like they were back and and there was predictions that they were gonna be a	3790	B
you know it'll be real challenge in fact i think they started ranks like you know fifteenth in the polls or something- and then you know then it was a long slide down it really was it- a fairly disappointing year	3790	B
it yeah it's it's pretty serious uh you know i i end up being so busy that i i don't watch much of it and and i don't follow it much but it's obvious that the people around me do	3790	B
you know and and i sometimes feel bad that i haven't you know i'm not up on it more	3790	B
right	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
right and and supposedly uh uh his brother his younger brother is graduating supposedly his younger brother is supposed to be a lot better than he is yeah	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
no i don't know Texas	3790	B
yeah	3790	B
uh-huh	3790	A
yes go for that -well that's who i kind of thought uh that's who i was gonna kind of cheer for i just	3790	A
think all the teams from the AFC are more or less like the minor leagues for the NFC lately so	3790	A
i just i hope they can give them_1 a game i think it'll be a good game this year but	3790	A
i don't know in the past they haven't been so hot	3790	A
do you uh	3790	A
well i i think a lot of them_1 uh uh kind of like me i i cheer i like players you know certain players and so i root for those teams and Brigham Young University of course is pretty big up here	3790	A
and so a lot of people like the 49ers because_1 Steve Young plays for them uh Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him you know when he played for them but he kind of got to be a jerk so nobody liked him anyway but	3790	A
uh a lot of 49ers i think uh more than anything i guess but uh	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
yep	3790	A
yeah we i i've always been kind of a Cowboys fan i like them i'm glad to see they're doing a little bit better but i- see i just usually root for players that i know of i guess and whatever happens happens so	3790	A
oh yeah	3790	A
oh	3790	A
oh yeah well i think i think you'll see i bet in the nineties they come out and i'll bet they're the team to beat is i mean they got so many first and second round picks again this year that i think they're gonna be really tough and Jimmy Johnson	3790	A
oh yeah that Jimmy Johnson seems to know what he's doing too are you	3790	A
um-hum	3790	A
um-hum	3790	A
oh yeah well you'd think that the just the personalities the people it it it would seem a lot harder to get them_1 motivated i mean it's a job then and you know you're not out for school spirit or whatever you know you're out for the fifty grand	3790	A
yeah that's true	3790	A
yeah that's true i guess	3790	A
oh was he on a college level or junior college oh so did you play at all yourself or	3790	A
uh-huh	3790	A
yeah i stopped growing i think about when i was twelve years old and everybody- else grew up so i quit after Little League because i realized it was	3790	A
i was gonna get pounded on if i kept going so	3790	A
yep but do you follow college much at all either or	3790	A
do you	3790	A
uh-huh	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
uh-huh	3790	A
oh really	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
well i you know what they're i mean football in Texas that's pretty uh it's uh like a rabid thing down there isn't it	3790	A
um-hum	3790	A
yeah	3790	A
yeah in fact that's that was our whole reason for cheering this year because_1 that uh Ty Detmer was from Texas down there and that's that's who i follow quite a bit is BYU but	3790	A
and so we were kind of prejudiced towards him good or bad or whatever anybody thinks but yeah they seem that he just from what he was saying his dad was a coach his brother was into it i mean that just seemed like a lot of people were involved kind of like Indiana and basketball or something	3790	A
oh really that'll be interesting see i know uh he's he been recruited pretty heavily he's not sure if he wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and go to the Y i wouldn't do it if i were him	3790	A
boy if he doesn't live up to that at least his brother's expectations-	3790	A
okay it's pressed are you still there okay	3769	A
so what's uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um	3769	A
um that sounds pretty	3769	A
yeah	3769	A
um-hum well we don't go out to dinner that much either we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that but	3769	A
i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean you know	3769	A
um i've been to some that's been terrible you know you see cockroaches crawling around and	3769	A
everything you know but i try to get one that's nice and clean and then i like to you know good food and good service	3769	A
so	3769	A
yeah right right right	3769	A
so is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um-hum um-hum	3769	A
um	3769	A
um that sounds beautiful	3769	A
um-hum um-hum	3769	A
um-hum um-hum well this is only a little small city um we have uh	3769	A
excuse me	3769	A
i didn't think my coughing would come back	3769	A
anyhow we have only like one uh	3769	A
restaurant that's kind of nice you know they have prime rib on uh weekends	3769	A
and then- then they have a about six miles from here is called a little city called Wesley	3769	A
and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food and the atmosphere there is really really nice	3769	A
so and then if we really want to you know something different then we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away	3769	A
but uh we don't have any fast foods here in this small city	3769	A
do i have kids well i have a son but he's grown up	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
yeah all the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they you know	3769	A
no no i'm sure there isn't	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
i know it's	3769	A
yeah	3769	A
yeah	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
well let's see what else can we talk about	3769	A
oh it's foggy and cold here	3769	A
um-hum um-hum yeah it's	3769	A
i came from Iowa when i was sixteen	3769	A
so i've lived out in California for a long long time yeah i like it real well	3769	A
we used to live in Oakland so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there	3769	A
you know but uh then i quit work and everything and i moved- bought a house i had a condo in Oakland so right in Chinatown so we went to a lots of restaurants and Chinese restaurants	3769	A
and they were really good i really miss them_1	3769	A
you know	3769	A
uh no i really don't miss living there i just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while you know	3769	A
but um as far as missing living there no it's close enough if i wanted to go there to San Francisco for dinner or something why you know	3769	A
an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back but uh	3769	A
have you ever been to California	3769	A
oh really	3769	A
um	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um	3769	A
um-hum um-hum	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
yeah i guess	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
um-hum	3769	A
i'm ready	3769	B
oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere	3769	B
just to relax you know because_1 i don't really go out to dinner that much so	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
right	3769	B
oh	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
yeah where you don't feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want and	3769	B
well nearby we're almost in Dallas we're just north of Dallas	3769	B
so we have quite a bit between us and there it's about ten miles	3769	B
and there is all kinds of restaurants and	3769	B
i had one that was a favorite for a long time and then it changed hands and doubled the prices and then it finally went out of business	3769	B
so but it was really nice it had a fireplace and	3769	B
yeah it was really nice they had entertainment sometimes and you- you could just really relax there and enjoy it	3769	B
but it's gone	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
oh that's nice	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
right	3769	B
that's probably very fortunate for you do you have kids	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
you know McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list and i hate these places	3769	B
so uh-huh they do and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have so	3769	B
so we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and it's really it's tempting when you come home from work and you're tired and	3769	B
you know you just are tempted to give in to that and it costs a lot of money to do it too you know it adds up and it's not healthy and	3769	B
i- i really got into that habit for a while but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy	3769	B
so	3769	B
well how's California today	3769	B
is it that's what i've heard yeah	3769	B
yeah have you always lived there	3769	B
oh	3769	B
and you like it	3769	B
yeah we've been	3769	B
oh yeah	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
oh that would be fun	3769	B
yeah do you miss living there	3769	B
no	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
hum	3769	B
yeah	3769	B
uh-huh	3769	B
oh yeah i- i go all the time	3769	B
yeah well i have a twenty one year old daughter in college there and she um is world champion twirler	3769	B
and her coach is in California so she went there for six years	3769	B
so i went out a lot with her	3769	B
and uh yeah i know California pretty well and i love it	3769	B
and we tug back and forth who's gonna move	3769	B
but i think he's gonna move because i'm the person with more to lose here i have my twelve year old in school	3769	B
and she's happy she's always lived here in the south and i've had my house so	3769	B
i've too much to lose-	3769	B
cooking and foods huh what do you like to cook	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
oh dear	3716	B
oh probably not i have uh a bread recipe that's real easy that everyone always really does like that uh doesn't require kneading the dough	3716	B
and it's oh it is it's wonderful it's and what's funny is that you use uh bran All Bran and it looks like it's a wheat bread but it's actually All Bran and flour and uh	3716	B
you know it's regular types that you know you use and that sort of and you let it rise and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and you can punch it down and then uh make your rolls and they really are good and they're so easy to do	3716	B
that it seems like every time that we have a dinner party or that uh we're going some place where everybody's supposed to bring something and they've had my rolls before they always ask me to bring those rolls	3716	B
no i haven't	3716	B
oh how funny	3716	B
uh-huh well see i i've always used celery- i mean i've used celery before but i've never used the celery seed in it	3716	B
well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
see i've never put bell pepper in tuna fish either	3716	B
isn't that funny	3716	B
i was brought up with tuna fish it was made where you put in uh oh chopped hard boiled eggs which it now with no no with cholesterol	3716	B
and uh you know chopped up uh dill pickles and that sort of thing the standard old tuna fish	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
but isn't that interesting so you you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed i'll have to try that	3716	B
sometimes i do sometimes i use Miracle Whip it depends on what i have and sometimes if i'm using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit i'll use a little bit of mustard with it	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
yeah but not a bunch but enough to make it have a little bit more flavor	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
i like uh barbecue baby back ribs	3716	B
and uh and and they're so easy to do if you uh have a good barbecue sauce and you just cook them_1 very very slowly in the oven and it's not hard to cook like some meals are	3716	B
and it's not of course it's messy to eat that's the disadvantage and uh i make lasagna from scratch and people really like my lasagna and	3716	B
and so um sometimes i'm requested to make that	3716	B
or and that's- and that's not too hard to do because_1 you can do it in advanced and just bake it	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
yeah	3716	B
um-hum	3716	B
then i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie it just takes forever but it's uh when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy	3716	B
um um-hum i do but this one is basically it's like a normal pie crust but then you use this sort of uh it's a cream cheese um	3716	B
uh layering but you use thin it out a little bit uh or make it a little fluffier and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that	3716	B
and so it's sort of like in a way uh using cheese cake and you know but but it's not a real cheese cake and then you	3716	B
we could talk about my favorite subject	3716	A
food	3716	A
uh i don't cook a lot actually i've just started baking so i'm kind of interested in cakes and muffins and stuff like that but i can't seem to get them_1 exactly right	3716	A
so just trying to perfect some things i don't know i tried to make an apple sauce cake which i will never ever try to make again	3716	A
it was horrible i don't know if the cake was horrible or if i made it horrible	3716	A
hum	3716	A
oh hey	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
wow um-hum	3716	A
um-hum they request it	3716	A
i haven't gotten any requests yet actually i had a Christmas party at uh my office	3716	A
and i made the tuna fish sandwiches and everyone i mean i'm i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish so that'd be easy for me to make and i can't go wrong with it	3716	A
and so i made it and i used celery seed in my do you use celery seed in your tuna fish	3716	A
uh and i- i just thought it was so strange because i've never i thought that that's what celery seed was for was for tuna fish	3716	A
and so but everyone really really loved the tuna fish and they just couldn't get over the fact that i used celery in it and it just surprised me celery and and onion and	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
oh yeah it's great uh just like um really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed	3716	A
and i used like uh Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because_1 i really don't like mayonnaise- the Helman's mayonnaise	3716	A
but if you use a salad dressing which is kind of uh you know kind of a i guess a tart taste then it comes out really good but i was- uh it was the first time i've	3716	A
i've ever found out that that	3716	A
nobody else used celery seed i feel so silly but	3716	A
yeah i	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
right uh-huh	3716	A
oh	3716	A
right	3716	A
yeah- yeah i would i would put that too i just didn't have those things like i don't think i had eggs that night or something but i would have put eggs i would have put in eggs in there also	3716	A
but that's strange	3716	A
and celery seed	3716	A
do you use a regular mayonnaise or	3716	A
the salad- the Miracle Whip	3716	A
yeah	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
yeah i do that also um-hum just to put a little zing in it or something	3716	A
oh no	3716	A
what-	3716	A
what else do i like i love barbecue anything barbecue i'll eat	3716	A
um um	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
yeah hum	3716	A
yeah	3716	A
yeah i like to make that too i make that once in a while	3716	A
hum	3716	A
it's not really as long as you have all the ingredients it's just the layering really and and not breaking the uh the the uh pasta is the hardest part probably	3716	A
but um yeah	3716	A
um	3716	A
do you make a cheese cake	3716	A
hum	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um	3716	A
um-hum	3716	A
um yeah and you just put the strawberries	3716	A
uh -okay uh do you live in a a single family dwelling as they call it	3710	A
okay what sort of house is it	3710	A
-yeah	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
garage is that an actual closed in garage or is that carport type of thing	3710	A
okay	3710	A
never actually be out of the house	3710	A
yeah around here they tell you if it if the advertisement for houses for sale says garage	3710	A
it- it- it could mean anything from a uh part of the house all closed in to a uh uh nice corrugated fiberglass roof kind of hanging in the middle of the yard somewhere	3710	A
-yeah most of them_1 are carports you know they'll be attached to the to the to the house but it'll just be a an extension of roof to over you know one or two parking spaces where	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
now y'all aren't quite getting all that flooding that Texas has been getting have you	3710	A
you're getting part of that uh uh	3710	A
okay	3710	A
um-hum yeah	3710	A
what	3710	A
there's areas that are so bad about flooding that they just don't cover them_1	3710	A
huh	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
you know- come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here	3710	A
which was real confusing when i first moved into this area because_1 it-	3710	A
well actually right now my wife and i are living uh campus housing	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
they're apartment buildings one and two and three bedroom places uh be like you know	3710	A
excuse me	3710	A
like uh twenty five or thirty units per building and then- something like uh	3710	A
twenty five thirty buildings	3710	A
about half of them_1 are	3710	A
one bedroom places	3710	A
there's a pretty good number of two bedroom places and then there's like uh fifteen or twenty three bedroom places	3710	A
but uh oh they're not really too bad they're they're basically cinder block places	3710	A
but uh	3710	A
yeah graduated in in what	3710	A
physics	3710	A
wow sounds like fun	3710	A
i i've got a physics- couple of physics classes facing me this summer- this summer so	3710	A
yeah uh from what i've seen of it i mean you know there's a lot of things that kind of dabble in the edges of physics before you actually get into the class	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
yeah i remember a a teacher in high school saying that uh he enjoyed physics because_1 it it improved his uh his uh pool game	3710	A
uh anyway	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
yeah	3710	A
um well	3710	A
once we get out of school we're hoping to get into the mountains somewhere	3710	A
probably out west um	3710	A
yeah more than likely uh the rainy side of the mountains somewhere	3710	A
but uh um originally i'm from West Virginia in the Appalachian Mountains	3710	A
so uh uh long since fell in love with living in the mountains but it'd probably be like a two story possibly even a three story if we build our own we might even get a little crazy and you know build into the side of a hill	3710	A
and do it- the	3710	A
yeah i uh i'm buying my own home	3710	B
um well it's a one story three bedroom two bath two car garage	3710	B
with a single living area a large single living area	3710	B
yeah	3710	B
no it's a a closed in garage to attached to the house	3710	B
so that i can uh i can leave my home go into the garage get in the car and not get into any weather at all	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh you're kidding that's crazy-	3710	B
to the home uh-huh	3710	B
wow	3710	B
uh-huh most of the time when i had- when i was looking for a house matter of fact the	3710	B
they would tell you if it were a carport or if it were um	3710	B
if it were a detached garage	3710	B
so	3710	B
ah yeah we're getting part of it uh-huh it's um	3710	B
it's really kind of odd we ah we had hoped not to be in too much of it and matter of fact matter of fact in in Texas	3710	B
they have flood plain areas where it's every- about every hundred years the area floods where the insurance companies won't insure you for it	3710	B
like uh	3710	B
like what is i'm trying to think of the name of that park	3710	B
they- yeah they wouldn't cut they will not issue flood insurance	3710	B
and i can i can see where there's some areas in Dallas that are definitely like that	3710	B
but uh	3710	B
oh no huh we have	3710	B
was it what kind of uh home are you in	3710	B
oh okay is it uh apartment style or uh-huh	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh okay	3710	B
gosh	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
three bedroom uh-huh	3710	B
well i was that's kind of what i had envisioned from uh visiting the ones in at North Texas University where my husband just graduated	3710	B
uh physics	3710	B
PhD in physics	3710	B
oh yeah yeah	3710	B
uh actually they're they're very enlightening and they're a lot of fun	3710	B
they are	3710	B
yeah well most everything touches physics one way or another no matter what you do even if nobody tells you that's what it is it's it's physics	3710	B
uh-huh oh yeah mathematics too but	3710	B
uh back to housing what kind of a home would you and your wife look for	3710	B
once uh once you finish schooling	3710	B
oh really	3710	B
uh-huh Oregon- Oregon or Washington	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh that's a beautiful area	3710	B
uh-huh	3710	B
oh i see	3710	B
that would probably-	3710	B
uh no actually i'm still single	3730	B
yeah but my mom uh she teaches at a uh child care center	3730	B
yeah uh you've heard of Kinder Care	3730	B
yeah it's a big chain she uh she teaches up in uh up in the Washington area	3730	B
matter of fact it's a pretty big business	3730	B
uh-huh	3730	B
do they have a lot of those up in Utah	3730	B
yeah they're they're growing really really fast i remember uh i- i worked with a bunch of people uh uh for the summer and she was trying and one of the ladies there who drove me there she was trying to put her daughter in child care and it was the the competition is pretty fierce you know	3730	B
uh some places uh charge a lot of money and offer all sorts of amenities	3730	B
some places are like really cheap but uh you know they like have a it's like a home or something an old home they just hire a bunch of people and have a big yard and let the kids play back there	3730	B
yeah and	3730	B
well she was um she was looking for something cheap obviously uh someone to take care of her kid but that at the same time she didn't want you know some people that were like a bunch of teenagers you know	3730	B
just out there working because_1 some people do that they'll just go to high school or something get some kids who work for five dollars an hour and get them_1 out there and that's all they really care about you know	3730	B
but uh some places like uh they have uh they set up a gym you know like a jungle gym and uh they they emphasize like athletics and stuff like that but those kinds of places get pretty expensive and it's really for the yuppies	3730	B
um-hum	3730	B
yeah	3730	B
hum	3730	B
yeah my uh that's that's what uh what my mom you know thinks is the best way to do it you know if you know someone uh who's willing to take care of the person who's willing to take care of the kids that that uh you know that you can trust	3730	B
that's probably the best way to do it because sometimes you know i- i don't know if you saw the thing on uh some news i think on ABC one time they was showing how people the some of the people were just smacking the kids around you know	3730	B
um-hum	3730	B
um	3730	B
um-hum yeah	3730	B
how many kids do you have	3730	B
just one	3730	B
yeah	3730	B
um-hum	3730	B
is it expensive up there	3730	B
yeah it it can get real expensive i remember i worked at a place in Washington called Intelsat	3730	B
and uh the building also house WJLA and they had a it was the child care facility was on one of the floors in the building	3730	B
and uh they would charge i think the rate was eight hundred dollars a month for child care but the convenience was that the kid was in the same building as you were and it was a and	3730	B
oh yeah oh yeah	3730	B
oh yeah but uh the the child care facility was really top notch they had uh the where the kids were was i mean the right above it was an executive uh room for the WJLA right below it was an executive room for WJLA and it's all glass	3730	B
so i mean there's really nothing they couldn't do they could do that uh you know that nobody could see you know so everything was pretty much under uh you know uh supervision	3730	B
and since uh the building was built on a park on park land they had plenty of land to go out and just play around if they wanted to and	3730	B
oh yeah i mean you can go visit your kids during the day you know and see see how they're doing	3730	B
yeah	3730	B
but anyway well i think we got our three minutes	3730	B
hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye bye	3730	B
child care or	3730	A
are you	3730	A
oh does she what	3730	A
yeah i have	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
yeah it is my wife teaches- is teaches at this uh little small family owned one here in Utah but uh	3730	A
i don't know what do you think about it	3730	A
uh they do actually there's quite a few and getting more and more seems like	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
play all day	3730	A
so what was she looking for when she was out around	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
well my wife i mean they they have a prepared you know little school- school type lessons for them_1 and stuff but	3730	A
but the kids sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that that stuff doesn't go over too well she	3730	A
she's not too set on the whole thing i mean it's a job for her she has to take it but	3730	A
uh she's not too she'd rather almost just get a somebody she knows you know personally and have them babysit her you know her kids	3730	A
if she had to	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
yeah yeah her	3730	A
yeah well that was and that was what really kind kind of scared us is because_1 well we we have a daughter and she goes with her but she's in a different class and my wife will poke her head downstairs and she'll see the lady screaming at the kids and stuff and i'm just going wait a minute you know i mean	3730	A
she's a year and half you you know eighteen months old	3730	A
it seems uh i don't know i was pretty	3730	A
i'm not i- i don't like them_1 i think	3730	A
we just have one just a little daughter eighteen months and	3730	A
i said i it's the only reason you know she the only reason we have my wife working is that she can work with her she can go to work with her otherwise it's	3730	A
well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think we're pretty cheap i heard once that like out in Boston it could be upwards of four hundred dollars a month and here you and yeah	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
gee	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
but you know the kind of money you have to make to make that even worthwhile i mean you know to pay eight hundred bucks out of your income	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
oh really	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
uh-huh	3730	A
yeah	3730	A
um-hum	3730	A
yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think that's	3730	A
yeah go have lunch with them_1 and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool	3730	A
but	3730	A
yeah hey well it's been good talking to you	3730	A
all right see you later bye bye	3730	A

um-hum	3735	A
see- it was too pointed	3735	A
so i tore it back apart again and i haven't tried another one	3735	A
no but i bought a little lamb pattern	3735	A
and the material and everything to make it out of but i haven't made it yet	3735	A

my neighbor did it first and i seen her house and i saw how beautiful it looked so then i decided well i was gonna do it	3735	A
and um it turned out really really good	3735	A
uh mostly flowers	3735	A

oh those are wonderful aren't they	3735	B
oh yeah that and that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff it it'd be nice to have that	3735	B
oh that's neat well do you have um uh i guess you're kind of young i was gonna say do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for	3735	B
oh uh-huh	3735	B
oh well well how did you get involved in that	3735	B
you just	3735	B
so you did buy a pattern and then started from there huh	3735	B
uh-huh uh-huh have- have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress yeah i've i did make some clothes for one of those and-	3735	B
dress one of those yeah i have quite a few of them_1 actually in my house i and most of them_1 i have bought um already clothed but i did i did make the dress on one of them_1 i kind of made the pattern up it's not it's probably not the best but i	3735	B
oh it did oh	3735	B
oh	3735	B
you haven't sewn it back up huh	3735	B
uh-huh uh do you do any kind of painting or anything	3735	B
uh-huh	3735	B
oh uh-huh	3735	B
i tried- i tried that i did i i ended up just stenciling a um a blind like a just a roller shade but i i can i had a hard time stenciling for some reason i just couldn't do it	3735	B
and people have told me it's very easy	3735	B
well-	3735	B
what design did you use	3735	B
oh uh-huh and what room	3735	B
have you	3735	B
i guess we're ready to talk	3797	B
well let's talk about air pollution what do you think causes air pollution in Dallas	3797	B
or where are you from maybe you're not in Dallas	3797	B
okay	3797	B
uh	3797	B
well i have some small experience in this area the brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown	3797	B
a lot of that is uh tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish-gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates	3797	B
but uh the one of the major problems that Dallas has is- is oxides and nitrogen that's because of all the equipment that's being operated but at the same time	3797	B
uh because we don't have we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we don't get a lot of particulates now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas	3797	B
uh power plants since	3797	B
many of our local power plants uh are natural gas most of the time	3797	B
uh the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and NOX there's no particulates in natural gas of course	3797	B
and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products we're burning fuel oil and a few other things but gasoline of course now that lead's out at least theoretically	3797	B
uh	3797	B
uh i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur that's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter there's a little sulphur yes	3797	B
and that's uh course hydrogen sulfide which is when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur and you under the right condition you get H2S	3797	B
but anyway uh	3797	B
well i don't know but	3797	B
um-hum	3797	B
Ron- uh Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because of the way the pollution is	3797	B
and when they run rich they they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons	3797	B
and that's another part of the problem	3797	B
the gas is not being burned completely	3797	B
but um	3797	B
if- hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better	3797	B
well i- i guess i not trying to top you but i grew up in Dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of of Central	3797	B
and uh i can remember coming over the hill down there long about um	3797	B
i don't know little bit north of Mockingbird- Mockingbird on up in over those hills	3797	B
and i said i wonder if they'll ever need this road	3797	B
course it was designed for most of us to go about forty five miles an hour because the short on ramps and off ramps but gosh seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet i hopefully the new ones will be a lot better	3797	B
um-hum	3797	B
yeah Ron have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty five i guess towards Waxahachie Hillsborough on down to Austin	3797	B
you hit a point down there about i think where they call Bear Creek exit right just this side of the county line right along in there somewhere suddenly the air feels cleaner	3797	B
have you noticed that	3797	B
well sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing but uh i also travel a little bit and uh	3797	B
i don't know it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier it may be all in my mind	3797	B
how you doing Howard this is a a subject that i'm not real well versed on but	3797	A
okay	3797	A
no okay i'm from the uh i'm from Dallas i'm in Richardson	3797	A
what do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area	3797	A
right	3797	A
right	3797	A
oh really	3797	A
sure	3797	A
well you are you are well versed on the subject i tell you	3797	A
this is not one of my better ones i guess i guess i notice it the most just uh in driving around Dallas with all the	3797	A
the highway equipment that's working on the on six thirty five and seventy five just with the cars in general that's where i see most of it	3797	A
right	3797	A
oh i don't know i've lived here since seventy four Howard and i don't- i think i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here and i think they'll i think they'll be working on them_1 long after my wife and i are gone	3797	A
how-	3797	A
right	3797	A
i understand i sure hope so i tell you you know you get out on the uh interstate highways versus i travel quite a bit and traveling from like Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the	3797	A
pollution created by the automobiles in the in the stalled traffic and the busy highways you know you're at your best and i guess when you're out on the interstate heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no	3797	A
build up of cars and	3797	A
yes	3797	A
i tell you what i- i don't think i really have but i'm going that way Tuesday and i'm going to make it a point to	3797	A
sure	3797	A
oh i know i know going to uh uh i detest going to Houston because it's such a long-	3797	A
do you know about the space program	3753	B
think they keep it that way purposely	3753	B
yeah it's gonna take uh i think it's gonna take a long time before they uh get that space colony out there	3753	B
they uh i remember uh six five six years ago they showed on uh one of the scientific channels you know not Discovery but one of those old ones	3753	B
they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages	3753	B
and it's supposed to be about ten miles long	3753	B
right right well they- they were all gonna be research scientists out there and they were just gonna build it up and make it bigger and bigger	3753	B
and but the initial stage was supposed to be about_1 ten miles long which is i mean huge for i guess for space	3753	B
um	3753	B
no it was more like uh one big long thing it wasn't uh anything circular i've seen a circular pattern too uh but i don't know if uh you know how far along they went with the circular pattern	3753	B
but uh like i say this was a long time ago and uh they this is one big long one that they had planned on and they had thought out how they were gonna uh regenerate the air with plants and stuff and they had a	3753	B
no they had they had thought out they had thought it out only the only thing was it was really really expensive and it was	3753	B
not if you got to think about it was five or six years they said you know by nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight we would actually be able to uh to start launching this thing	3753	B
and they'd have to take several projects to go up there before and add on piece by piece	3753	B
um-hum um-hum	3753	B
right and then they've and once it got big enough they would send more people up once it got established and they got all the systems working	3753	B
yeah pretty fascinating	3753	B
no it was pretty it was- no it was a it was a gravity free environment they uh they had shown- they had shown like at some sort of uh simulation on how it would be up there and they showed people floating around so uh	3753	B
at- at the point- i don't think there was any kind of uh you know gravity control whatsoever	3753	B
uh-huh hm	3753	B
uh-huh	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
hm	3753	B
yeah i can see that	3753	B
oh	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
hm	3753	B
no uh these these people definitely didn't look into any kind of stuff like that they were just talking about the space station itself and how were they gonna put it up there and spend all this money they uh	3753	B
um-hum um-hum	3753	B
uh-huh	3753	B
hm	3753	B
uh-huh yeah uh-huh	3753	B
right right right	3753	B
hm	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
hm	3753	B
hm hm	3753	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3753	B
that's pretty neat hm then i would- i'd mean it makes sense you know i never had thought about it you ever see the uh the EPCOT Center	3753	B
the uh at the EPCOT Center in- in uh i think it's the the AT and T display they show a a bunch of uh future space pods and what life would be like out in space	3753	B
it's it's pretty neat i still think it's a long ways away though	3753	B
um-hum	3753	B
yeah yeah	3753	B
um-hum yeah and and i tell you the you know it's expensive	3753	B
uh no no-	3753	B
well actually at this point my understanding of the space program is a little on the limited side um	3753	A
yeah well that's to an extent that's understandable	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
um-hum	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
oh it's supposed to be more of a colony than a than a research lab	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah like a central unit and then everything else kind of rotating out from that	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
oh okay	3753	A
they they had thought that out or hadn't	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah so it was all modular like you send up a small section it'd be liveable for a couple of people and they send up another section and bolt it on and	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
yeah well that sort of thing could work um	3753	A
what did they- did- did- was there any indication what they're going do about uh gravity	3753	A
or were they just gonna let you bob around	3753	A
hm	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
now what what they've started figuring out lately is that gravity or some form of it makes it a whole lot easier to stay up there for long periods	3753	A
some of the uh i i've heard little bits of stuff about some of their things they found out about that was- was it one and a half year stay some Soviet cosmonauts spent up in space	3753	A
and they had some problems digestive tract problems and uh uh minor circulatory- uh little problems but they could eventually become pretty big problems or if people people with with problems to start with that weren't really noticed yet	3753	A
they they could generate into big problems um	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
that's why a lot of the um designs for space stations have been circular	3753	A
so they can get them_1 spinning centrifugal force comes close enough to uh uh simulating gravity that there's very little problem with uh uh {gravityless} uh side effects	3753	A
you know i don't know if you saw it was it two thousand and one that uh that double wheel arrangement	3753	A
that's uh one of the more popular theories	3753	A
they also have them_1 where you got a long central cylinder kind of like a like a cross connection tube and a lot of pods sticking out from that central core kind of like a big pine cone like deal	3753	A
or a bottle brush almost where the pods are all rotating in enough of a a	3753	A
a rotation speed so that the centrifugal force pretty much is one uh is- is equal to earth gravity	3753	A
so	3753	A
no no i've not	3753	A
yeah	3753	A
well actually it needs to be put off for a little while for now just because_1 there's so much money going into it that would be a whole lot better spent on on local problems	3753	A
um the health care and and uh law enforcement uh	3753	A
oh yeah	3753	A
um-hum	3753	A
uh-huh	3753	A
uh the bulk of them_1 probably have aren't even pressurized	3753	A
okay let me tell you i haven't been too many places	3754	B
see now that's where i wanna go that's where i've always wanted to go i've never been there	3754	B
i know ah is it is it um	3754	B
i had an aunt that lived there and she she couldn't stand it anymore she moved out because she said the whole island was taken- you know being taken over by the Japanese	3754	B
yeah and she- and um she also told me that well not her uh necessarily other people that have been there said it's it's too commercialized	3754	B
is it	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
sure	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
oh well i will eventually what- well what is- what's the most uh you know the nicest island	3754	B
Maui i think that's usually what people uh say they didn't they like the best	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
well i have been to California i've been to San Francisco i loved it i absolutely loved it	3754	B
yeah and um	3754	B
oh uh eighty six	3754	B
my sister lives out there my sister lives in Piedmont	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
uh-huh oh well that's right near Piedmont right	3754	B
yeah well yeah that's like a suburb or something what is that oh yeah okay well she lived in Berkeley also and she	3754	B
let's see i went when she	3754	B
was uh living when- well- like when i went out there she was in um	3754	B
now i can't- oh Lafayette she was living in Lafayette	3754	B
and then they moved to Piedmont	3754	B
so i uh i haven't seen uh you know her house in Piedmont but	3754	B
but i love San Francisco i'd like to go back	3754	B
oh yeah went to Alcatraz you know we did the whole bit and then we went to the wine country	3754	B
yeah oh beautiful and uh we went to Carmel you know and we took the eighteen mile drive	3754	B
so then- she- they never got to do that	3754	B
oh i haven't been there either you name it i haven't been there i	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
oh that's nice	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
um-hum	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
well that's nice is is that cruise nicer than it if you just go on a regular you know to a hotel or you know it is now i've heard it is yeah	3754	B
um-hum	3754	B
no huh	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
uh-huh	3754	B
right yeah	3754	B
oh yes now someone i know was- was on a cruise to Alaska and uh	3754	B
was it Alaska yeah i'm pretty sure that's right my hairdresser she went last year she said she went on a cruise and i'm thinking you know cruise i'm thinking	3754	B
you know and uh that that's uh i'd like to go well Hawaii would- is my uh is my is number one i'd also like to go to Australia have you	3754	B
yeah	3754	B
oh well see i i'm just into the Publisher's Clearing House and the Reader's Digest because we don't uh right now the lottery here	3754	B
okay i pressed the button so	3754	A
you haven't been to too many places	3754	A
okay well i've been to Hawaii	3754	A
oh it's	3754	A
it's beautiful	3754	A
well there is there is a lot of Japanese over there and they're	3754	A
um-hum ooh well yeah there's it's commercialized but there's still a lot of beautiful places to go and see	3754	A
you know uh on all of the islands you know now the island of of Oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands but	3754	A
but it's still beautiful you've got to see it at least once you know	3754	A
so	3754	A
uh i like Maui	3754	A
yeah	3754	A
i mean i like it because the beach is nice and white and you know it's like um Oahu you can go over there lay on the beach and it's really nice	3754	A
where the island of Hawaii you really can't lay on the beach over there you know	3754	A
but um in Kauai it's	3754	A
and i mean their beaches are nice but i don't know just not nice as Maui	3754	A
and then uh have you where have where have you been	3754	A
oh you have	3754	A
oh	3754	A
how long ago	3754	A
hm okay_1	3754	A
oh yeah i know where that's at because_1 i used to live in Oakland	3754	A
so	3754	A
yeah right right	3754	A
yes uh-huh uh-huh	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
oh yeah right	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
yeah did you go in the cable cars and everything yeah isn't that fun	3754	A
oh yeah up by Napa yeah yeah	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
isn't that pretty i love it down there	3754	A
um-hum	3754	A
oh what the weather	3754	A
um well i have also been to the Carribean	3754	A
well i've i been there a couple of times	3754	A
i went on a cruise	3754	A
the last time i went i went with my two sisters	3754	A
and it was over Christmas time	3754	A
and we really had a good time	3754	A
well they	3754	A
um had this cruise director dress up like Santa Claus and we went to the beach and they had put a Christmas tree on the beach decorated it up and it was it was a lot of fun	3754	A
so	3754	A
oh yeah	3754	A
yeah because you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know you put your clothes in your room and oh you'll have to go on one	3754	A
no no i mean there was some people did	3754	A
um on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in but that's unusual	3754	A
um one of my sisters got sick but the other one didn't and i didn't	3754	A
you know	3754	A
but um it's really nice and they just they just do so many things for you you know to make you enjoy the trip and everything	3754	A
so you'll have to do that once i wanna go on another one but i wanna go to Alaska	3754	A
um-hum um-hum	3754	A
oh really	3754	A
yeah right	3754	A
oh i i think i would like to too	3754	A
i keep hoping to win the lotto for i can do all these things you know	3754	A
um-hum	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
well i- i think we have a neighborhood watch i think i'm not real we don't get real involved we're never home so um	3774	B
uh well i know they were gonna start one but uh i haven't heard any more since so i don't really know but as far as personally doing something no	3774	B
how about_1 you	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
yeah yeah huh	3774	B
oh i'm sure it is	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
um-hum um-hum	3774	B
uh i would too if i had kids we don't have any we did install a um a uh motion detector light back in our driveway	3774	B
and that was mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on but also we have a boat back there and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief so we thought with that light you know it would	3774	B
maybe keep them from doing something to the boat yeah so	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
yeah yeah that's what it is we live in Coppell and and that's pretty much what it is is you know	3774	B
kids that are bored like you say	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
oh no	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
yeah yeah	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh i know it hm	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
um-hum um-hum	3774	B
yeah yeah huh	3774	B
yeah	3774	B
yeah it is it really is	3774	B
yeah i'm originally from Chicago but i've been in this area in the Louisville area for uh let's see about twenty three years	3774	B
oh definitely in the last few years i think and uh	3774	B
like i say now i don't think necessarily in this area here but	3774	B
just Dallas in general i don't know i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of those things	3774	B
i did you know i wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night in a dark parking lot so	3774	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3774	B
um-hum	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
uh-huh	3774	B
huh	3774	B
um-hum um-hum	3774	B
um	3774	B
i don't either	3774	B
yeah hm	3774	B
hm	3774	B
so i've been concerned about crime lately um it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems i wondered if- you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood	3774	A
uh-huh	3774	A
uh-huh	3774	A
no hm	3774	A
well we moved in when we moved in there there wasn't any outside lights and so we've been trying to install some	3774	A
um outside lights and we put up a fence in the backyard mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard you know	3774	A
and i guess most of the crime that i'm concerned about generally is against my- my kids it's scary to send them_1 off down the street a few houses	3774	A
to let them_1 go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything and	3774	A
so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them_1 walk down the street and say call me before you leave and come back and	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
oh no	3774	A
then that's a good thought	3774	A
well we've been real lucky that i don't believe there's been you know much trouble in our neighborhood but it but it does seem there that there is a lot more here in Plano of um just	3774	A
bored teenagers vandalism	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
but	3774	A
yeah and they don't uh i know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their they've parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and	3774	A
a few things like that and course you know i don't know i'm getting scared for the kids to get older because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who and or is it just random	3774	A
crime but um we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime	3774	A
but uh it's really scary to know that you- you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe and	3774	A
but i guess i take a lot of um little bit of um	3774	A
safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or um things that places usually that i wouldn't be going and things i usually wouldn't be involved in	3774	A
and uh there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to but it is scary	3774	A
were you raised in this area	3774	A
hm	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
so has it been getting worse that you've noticed or about the same hm	3774	A
um-hum	3774	A
right	3774	A
right	3774	A
take a lot of chances well i noticed that um	3774	A
that uh when we we moved here from Houston not too long ago and so of course we were interested in schools and um	3774	A
but the schools in Houston all have big tall fences around them_1 and they're not really very safe	3774	A
and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all around them_1 and it's just a whole different idea that that at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school	3774	A
and in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school	3774	A
and so that's been something that's been good for the you know in this area that you feel like um you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today and i guess i don't know how people live with that everyday	3774	A
pretty scary	3774	A
but anyway well i guess i won't take up more of your time-	3774	A
well Delphene do you own a P C	3799	B
oh	3799	B
oh really	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
yeah	3799	B
oh	3799	B
wow	3799	B
um-hum	3799	B
with a hard drive uh-huh	3799	B
oh okay well that sounds interesting	3799	B
my husband and i own a PC and i use mine for like keeping our home finances	3799	B
and i also i- i play several games on it	3799	B
and i also was doing some work for my church doing some word processing on it for my church and that was	3799	B
really interesting being able to do that on the computer they were surprised at how much could be done	3799	B
with a PC	3799	B
i imagine if you advertise like in the	3799	B
oh the i guess like The Texan's or if there's another paper up there at at your office	3799	B
you should be able to get some work that way	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
yeah you really you have to be a little more selective	3799	B
you might even want to consider cold calling a couple of places for or checking the newspaper	3799	B
uh	3799	B
there might even be cottage industries now listed in the newspaper because_1 that's what it ends up being a cottage industry	3799	B
um-hum	3799	B
yeah is that what yours is	3799	B
i was thinking that they had recently come out with one that is	3799	B
ah uh-huh	3799	B
yeah	3799	B
yeah	3799	B
um-hum	3799	B
there	3799	B
well they're real inexpensive to get the clones now	3799	B
and i don't know if you watch your sale ads very often	3799	B
but if you do particularly Best Buy	3799	B
and Circuit City i saw a three eighty six hundred and twenty megabyte hard drive with dual floppies and	3799	B
oh gosh the VGA color monitor	3799	B
and it also included quite a few other things i mean pieces of software and a mouse for about two thousand or less	3799	B
and that's a really nice package for about that much money	3799	B
uh-huh	3799	B
the three and a half floppy	3799	B
those are nicer	3799	B
those i prefer that over the larger floppy	3799	B
they take up it you can get more information on the disk	3799	B
no	3799	B
i don't know what it is i guess because it's harder	3799	B
that you can get more information on it than you can on the larger ones	3799	B
and they're a lot easier to transport because it's harder to to damage them	3799	B
being in the harder plastic case	3799	B
so that's just a something that i've come across	3799	B
well that's mostly- um now that's what we have we don't have a real IBM i don't know of too many people who afford IBM	3799	B
but uh	3799	B
we've had not a minute of trouble out of ours not a minute	3799	B
and i would i would recommend it to other people	3799	B
well yes i do i have a T I P C	3799	A
in fact i have two of them_1 i have i have one that i collected the the uh ports for one at a time	3799	A
like first i bought just the uh the central processing unit and the monitor	3799	A
couple years later i bought a printer and then i needed a a hard drive	3799	A
so uh there was this guy at TI selling a a TI PC for four hundred dollars and it had everything had the works	3799	A
and it had the hard drive and everything	3799	A
so i bought that one instead of buying a hard- hard drive for mine so now i have that one with the hard drive and mine with no the the the other one with no hard drive	3799	A
and what i thought i'd use them_1 for was just to to do some work out of my house for	3799	A
you know people who needed uh word processing and stuff like that	3799	A
um-hum the	3799	A
uh-huh	3799	A
uh-huh	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
yeah i thought i might uh	3799	A
get some extra income somehow or another uh	3799	A
yeah	3799	A
yeah	3799	A
yeah i think i'll I'll i thought about doing that one time in fact i saw somebody else advertise in the Dallasite once	3799	A
and uh thought about putting an ad in the newspaper also but then i might just get too much business	3799	A
but i	3799	A
right	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
well i- i found a uh book once in the library that had sources for um work at home	3799	A
uh	3799	A
you know some of them_1 required that you have a PC but most of those wanted IBM compatibles	3799	A
and as as you know the TI PC is not IBM compatible	3799	A
yeah they do the the um the Business Pro	3799	A
which is that's what i have at work but uh	3799	A
i still have the problem of upgrading mine either to a Business Pro or just going out there and buying a an I B M clone	3799	A
then i'll have three P C's	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
uh-huh and Circuit City	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
well	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
uh-huh i saw um	3799	A
in fact i believe the one i saw was a three eighty six also it only had one one drive though but it had a hard drive	3799	A
you know some of them_1 have the little uh the the small	3799	A
yeah plus the the bigger one	3799	A
um-hum i've never used one of those at all	3799	A
you're kidding	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
oh i didn't- i didn't know that-	3799	A
oh wow	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
well i'm gonna look into getting one of those I B M clones	3799	A
but	3799	A
right	3799	A
um-hum	3799	A
you know what i watched a little bit of uh of the Bulls game and i uh had to leave um in fact i- i think the Bulls were ahead when i uh when i left who won the game	3796	B
is that right	3796	B
uh-huh	3796	B
wow they've got the don't they have the best record now	3796	B
yeah	3796	B
wow	3796	B
they they do and they uh you know i think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh	3796	B
of uh uh Michael Jordan really helped them out you know he doesn't have they don't have to rely on him to score every- you know thirty or forty points at every at every game so	3796	B
oh i know i'm yeah i saw the Warriors- i saw the Warriors uh just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors uh Dallas game	3796	B
they look good	3796	B
yeah now i don't uh i haven't kept up with what was going on with uh with the Warriors-	3796	B
uh-huh	3796	B
good move	3796	B
yeah	3796	B
uh i think Boston's in first um	3796	B
i you know i haven't kept up with any of the other uh teams uh i'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know	3796	B
oh man that well yeah but i mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them_1 and uh	3796	B
uh actually actually the the the Dallas area here uh pulls for Dallas uh San Antonio pulls for San Antonio and Houston pulls for for the Rockets	3796	B
they're really i mean not a whole lot you know i mean you find them_1 they're find them_1 be to be pretty loyal uh you know with- with the local teams	3796	B
um you know it's kind of i guess it's kind of like uh there in the Bay area you know you don't find a whole lot of uh uh of Sacramento fans	3796	B
really isn't huh-uh it's you know it's it's about the same uh same distance from here to San- to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento so it's yeah it's not really a local you know	3796	B
um he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio and they i mean they have got a great club you know	3796	B
uh yeah yeah that always makes a big difference so	3796	B
yeah	3796	B
and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really doesn't make the club	3796	B
but it really does you know you get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline of that team	3796	B
once he left you know i mean it's it's just not the same uh it's not the same team there's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for	3796	B
oh yeah	3796	B
who won that Portland game	3796	B
uh	3796	B
uh did you watch the Bulls this morning	3796	A
they won in a squeaker they won by they won by two points uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back in the second half and at the end i think they were	3796	A
uh looked they looked like they were closing it out and then Detroit kept coming back and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and uh i think the Bulls won by two	3796	A
i think they do as a matter of fact one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an NBA record for seventy wins in a season	3796	A
yeah they looked real good and	3796	A
right	3796	A
yeah well they they're they're balancing their attack and i think they look like uh	3796	A
they'll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors	3796	A
i saw the the second half of the game last night and they were impressive	3796	A
Billy Owens looks like he was that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him	3796	A
well they traded away uh	3796	A
Mitch Richmond or is it Tim Hardaway one of the two	3796	A
uh who along with uh Chris Mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the NBA and and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and uh	3796	A
yeah oh yeah he's really worked out well they've got the the Warriors have got a team uh and uh	3796	A
i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the Lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know uh is it Boston in uh first place	3796	A
boy they've had a hard time they said they've lost a lot of squeakers	3796	A
yeah	3796	A
how do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio do you for example like San Antonio uh in Dallas	3796	A
so there isn't much crossover huh you-	3796	A
yeah	3796	A
yeah it's true because San- San Antonio isn't that close to you are they	3796	A
no	3796	A
is it	3796	A
yeah so it's not something you'd drive	3796	A
yeah i was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing	3796	A
they've done a good job i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly	3796	A
yeah i mean that's i think the way it uh i think that's the way it works now in basketball you you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics and	3796	A
well it it's Steve	3796	A
well yeah i	3796	A
well i think you're right and i think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and i think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players and i think i think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be	3796	A
uh considered the likely favorites i don't know who would meet them in the west um i don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so disappointing	3796	A
you know i wasn't i- i didn't- i watched only a few minutes of it and i wasn't paying attention uh so i don't know uh but Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs and	3796	A
what was the last vacation you went on anyway	3755	A
um-hum	3755	A
ooh that's a long trip with four kids in the car	3755	A
yeah uh that sort of a trip can be kind of long just by yourself	3755	A
well that works out	3755	A
uh yeah	3755	A
uh yeah so far the- about_1 as far East as i've gone uh trip about_1 five years ago up to uh Minneapolis uh flew up and then drove back	3755	A
uh well uh the weather was wonderful the roads were fine uh the car i was driving back was a problem it kept wanting to fall apart	3755	A
basically i was bringing it back for the sons of a the lady i was renting from	3755	A
uh because one son living up there owned it wanted it rebuilt uh and- restored and son back here was going to do it but couldn't get loose for a couple few days to go up and get it	3755	A
so	3755	A
oh that was uh in May the weather was wonderful	3755	A
yeah um flew up it was the first time i'd flown and uh flew up just above uh thunderstorms that stretch from Texas at least up into uh the Great Lake area	3755	A
so we're watching	3755	A
oh yeah yeah we got to watch i got- i got to watch uh thunderstorm from the other side for once unique experience yeah the lightning from the top side is a unique experience	3755	A
i always enjoyed watching it from the bottom side but it's even more fun from the top	3755	A
um most of our vacations though have been you know camping trips of one sort or another or just going home to see family	3755	A
i well actually i'm at a pay phone the post office	3755	A
um no i do have one child he's about_1 twelve weeks old twelve and half weeks old now	3755	A
why thank you	3755	A
yeah yeah from looks of things wife and i are both in school	3755	A
the next trip is probably going to be next Christmas uh several of my siblings have decided that it'd been too long since we were home for Christmas	3755	A
uh West Virginia uh that's home for me	3755	A
uh i met her down here so her home town is only about uh an hour and half drive away	3755	A
but uh i'm a thousand miles from home so they're supposed to they're- they're trying to arrange to get us train tickets uh to go up home three of us	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
yep	3755	A
i've been through the northwest corner of Georgia that's been it uh that's pretty much in route between here and home	3755	A
so there's about a nine mile stretch of Interstate fifty nine that cuts through the northwest corner of Georgia	3755	A
but uh	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
kudzu	3755	A
yes this stuff is an absolute white on humanity it seems	3755	A
is it's pretty it it's it when it's genetically engineered	3755	A
that's the that's the southern version of what they've got up north called multiflora rose which is also engineered and it's almost indestructible	3755	A
i mean you about_1 have to expose the	3755	A
you know the first four feet of the soil to you know high levels of radiation to kill it off it- this stuff is incredibly durable	3755	A
yeah	3755	A
yeah its	3755	A
well you see that stuff what eventually take over everything and literally kill off large old trees if it gets the chance	3755	A
so most that states in the Southeast have uh spraying programs where they go in with defoliants and try and kill it off	3755	A
here in in Hattiesburg area no not yet but apparently it moving this direction	3755	A
actually up in the Delta you know four or five hours drive north along the Mississippi River they've got it there too	3755	A
but right now it hasn't really hit the uh the the general area around here place	3755	A
uh one trip i used to be an auto mechanic	3755	A
and one evening i got sent down into let's see Fort Walton Beach with a wrecker to tow a van back for a	3755	A
well we went to California over Christmas	3755	B
so that was nice we traveled by car though and that wasn't real nice because_1 i have four children	3755	B
it surely was	3755	B
well yeah we went to spend Christmas with my my family there and then my um girls are real involved in soccer and so we had a soccer tournament there also but	3755	B
yeah it was real nice the weather weather cooperated and- and it was real pretty there how about_1 you where have have you gone mostly East	3755	B
oh	3755	B
how was the drive back	3755	B
oh that's no good	3755	B
huh	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
what time of the year did you drive	3755	B
yeah i was gonna say the weather probably was real pretty then	3755	B
yeah they have some whopper of thunderstorms out on these plains	3755	B
lots of lightning	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
huh now	3755	B
and now i hear that you have children in the background	3755	B
oh	3755	B
oh congratulations you'll be taking him on some of trips then i guess	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
now where's home	3755	B
oh	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
huh	3755	B
oh	3755	B
like an Amtrak	3755	B
huh have you been to Georgia	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
well we went there last summer again for a soccer tournament and it was just beautiful there	3755	B
they have some kind of vine there that grows up and down and up and down trees	3755	B
yes that was it	3755	B
yeah but it's so pretty	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
huh	3755	B
yeah see i kept talking about_1 how beautiful it was and the natives there just would roll their eyes like you're crazy this is awful stuff but i -remember calling home and saying it's too pretty here all i'm staying forever	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
oh	3755	B
so do you have that there	3755	B
and me yeah	3755	B
uh-huh	3755	B
yeah so what about South have you been to Florida	3755	B
uh-huh	3755	B
yeah	3755	B
so what kind of hobbies you have	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
hm	3742	A
signatures like uh like important people i guess	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
hm that's pretty neat yeah most of my hobbies are uh i guess i uh i like cars i work on i like to work on my car and uh yes since i have an old car	3742	A
i have a i have a Honda it's an eighty three Honda this car's not too bad i don't have to work on it as much but i've before this i had a Toyota Corona i don't know if you ever heard of those cars but uh	3742	A
i had the car it's an eighty one Toyota Corona i must've worked on it like every third day i had it i had a i had a problem with the uh with the radiator	3742	A
uh the car basically would overheat i mean i i lived- used to live in Washington DC and didn't have any problems when i lived up there but soon as i came down here the heat was must must've been too intense for the car so the car kept overheating and turned out it was some kind of a problem with the radiator	3742	A
so i had the radiator replaced and they did everything they could possibly do they said there was some kind of problem they just couldn't figure out what it was	3742	A
and the Toyota dealer couldn't figure it out the radiator place couldn't figure it out so basically i had to keep adding water to the radiator every uh every couple days	3742	A
you know and what you had to do is you had to start it up let it get hot let it suck the radiator fluid into the engine then add more water to it then shut it and then you could run another three days	3742	A
oh yeah let me tell you i mean it's it was bad when it was in the winter time you had to do this too you know	3742	A
so uh	3742	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3742	A
no huh-uh	3742	A
oh is it like a mini car	3742	A
my my parents' next door neighbor have one of those	3742	A
they uh it um i think his wife won it in some kind of contest and he just uh it looks almost like a fake car because_1 it's so small it's you know and it's it's in perfect shape	3742	A
yeah really but uh it's it's really a neat looking car though and uh	3742	A
yeah	3742	A
um-hum um-hum um that's kind of kind of cool	3742	A
and the other hobby i have is uh i guess i play uh like the racket sports you know racquetball and tennis and i love to play that	3742	A
yeah um-hum	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
um-hum	3742	A
uh-huh	3742	A
well what i did was i played tennis for a long time then hadn't played for a long time then i started playing racquetball again	3742	A
and uh when i got really good at racquetball then i waited a while and i went back to tennis and so now when i'm back to either one of the sports you know since i since the gap was so far apart between the two i think that i get back to tennis soon as i pick up a tennis racket i'm i'm back into the swing	3742	A
and soon as i pick up a racquetball racket i'm back- it takes me a little while to to get as good you know uh i usually need you know at least a good hour warm-up before i'm i'm back into the swing	3742	A
but uh once i'm back in it you know it's pretty good	3742	A
oh yeah that's definite yeah you don't- it i have to really think about the uh the ceiling shots and the side wall shots you know	3742	A
uh and that's probably it probably puts more pressure on my brain than it does in my on my body	3742	A
it's a great sport see it's aerobic and uh and if you play with someone uh you got to play with someone who's as good as you are you know not better or not- and not worse	3742	A
because_1 if you play- i used to play with uh my roommate and uh from college and we uh we were both about the same as far as you know how good we both were you know and we'd have volleys that would last five or six minutes you know	3742	A
so it's it's a great sport great aerobic sport	3742	A
well the only reason i like it better than tennis is i used to play tennis with my dad and he plays uh old man tennis you know	3742	A
he could hit puts underspin on the ball all the time and he can hit every ball okay but he doesn't hit it hard he just hits it really lightly you know makes you run all over the place	3742	A
and it just kind of drives me up the wall	3742	A
well the primary thing that i do uh is go around and uh collect uh collectibles that are purchase collectibles and uh and some antiques uh go to a lot of garage sales and estate sales	3742	B
and collect signatures	3742	B
uh yeah uh -important people um oh some are just uh sports fans	3742	B
uh i had- i land like aviation so i've got a number of them_1 from uh uh like the Wright brothers uh uh Chuck Yeager um Charles Lindburgh things like that	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh do you	3742	B
what do you have	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
sure	3742	B
um-hum	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh jeez	3742	B
well that sounds like fun	3742	B
hm	3742	B
yeah oh yeah	3742	B
no as a matter of fact i've been uh seriously considering uh restoring a car	3742	B
um i was looking at a Nash Metropolitan	3742	B
i don't know if you know what those are	3742	B
uh they're little two tone uh cars that came out in	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
fifty-	3742	B
really	3742	B
huh	3742	B
yeah yeah	3742	B
does he wanna sell it	3742	B
oh	3742	B
yeah now i'm i've been trying to find one that's uh uh i was- i was looking at getting one of those and trying to restore it	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh	3742	B
both of them_1	3742	B
because_1 most of the folks that i found and i i used to play a lot of tennis then when i started playing racquetball uh by the time i finally got a swing down for racquetball i i found out i couldn't play tennis anymore	3742	B
uh-huh	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
oh good	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
well it's tough to do those ceiling shots on a tennis court	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
i tell you i really like uh racquetball	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
um-hum	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
i like it better than uh tennis just because i don't have to go so far to get the ball	3742	B
yeah	3742	B
uh-huh so who-	3742	B
um are you from this area	3736	B
well i don't know if you know but Garland has got a real big recycling center	3736	B
that in fact we went to yesterday you drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like	3736	B
clear glass and colored glass and plastics and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom	3736	B
that's pretty neat my my daughter is four and she's real interested in recycling so we're we're trying to promote that because_1 she thought we just put them_1 in a special trash can and threw them_1 away but	3736	B
we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them	3736	B
uh does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet	3736	B
oh okay	3736	B
yeah	3736	B
hum	3736	B
yeah um like soda bottles are one kind- one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic you can tell- it's got- it'll	3736	B
most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three	3736	B
it's it's just different kind of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic know that's what the different types are	3736	B
yeah	3736	B
yeah yes i i know there's a long scientific name but it's like {polytechnochloride} and all that fun stuff um i like	3736	B
i don't know if if they do it all over but our Kroger does a a newspaper recycling every Saturday you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there	3736	B
um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car and they'll put it in their little bin	3736	B
and they do the recycling i mean they collect the newspapers and their plastic- the plastic grocery bags	3736	B
which i think is pretty neat that's something since we all have- seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags i know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things	3736	B
yeah yeah in fact i have one today it's um-hum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom	3736	B
and it's like whoops there goes my chips okay fine	3736	B
now i in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night	3736	B
they did a program or the one of their articles was on recycling and or it was actually on a a town that has a dump that	3736	B
they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there they have made so much money from that	3736	B
that they built they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so they bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill	3736	B
they have built up one mountain they call it Mount Trashmore they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it	3736	B
so the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that it's like that's it's a it's Riverview Ohio or some place up there	3736	B
but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than Dallas' and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city	3736	B
okay	3736	B
but i thought that was pretty neat it it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and	3736	B
yeah see that's well they're already planning a second mountain so they're gonna get going to be called the Twin Peaks i was like uh-huh go back to the TV shows	3736	B
this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling	3736	B
oh it's we i know like i said i've got a two year old and a four year old and that's	3736	B
my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled so it's like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her	3736	B
what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them_1 into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and	3736	B
well yeah she- that was the her next question was how do you grow paper	3736	B
was like well from trees um that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees	3736	B
you crunch it up real small and then you melt it down well what if it breaks well okay it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her	3736	B
but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about so i guess what-	3736	B
i'm from Dallas yeah	3736	A
okay	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
um well i don't know if Dallas is Richardson does	3736	A
um they started with newspapers and uh of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic	3736	A
i didn't know there were different types of plastic though	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
oh	3736	A
oh okay-	3736	A
yeah it seems to be made out of something different	3736	A
uh	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
yeah	3736	A
hum	3736	A
that's right yeah	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
lunch bags and	3736	A
right-	3736	A
yeah they didn't	3736	A
yeah um-hum	3736	A
uh no	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
oh	3736	A
yeah	3736	A
wow	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
hum	3736	A
yeah they'll run out of space before long	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
right	3736	A
right yeah	3736	A
they don't even know that paper comes from trees yet so	3736	A
how do you grow paper	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
and how do you grow aluminum	3736	A
um	3736	A
right	3736	A
um-hum	3736	A
wood working do you do much in the way of wood working	3706	A
i'm in about the same condition um had access to a fair amount of my father's place before i	3706	A
moved away but uh it's been several years ago	3706	A
but i've always always enjoyed what chances i had to do wood working	3706	A
framing like picture framing	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
oh okay yeah okay well it was	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
yeah my	3706	A
right now what i've got in the way of wood working tools is a circular saw and a uh square	3706	A
that's it well a drill i do have a drill	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
i don't know the wood working projects i've been involved with lately we uh	3706	A
converted a uh a very large section of shelving from an a restaurant that went belly up into a small smaller set for the home it something for my text books and my computer to stand on	3706	A
um no	3706	A
ooh	3706	A
um-hum	3706	A
it's smooth faced doors	3706	A
these are like smooth faced doors	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
it would	3706	A
that would make a good table top	3706	A
oh the fellow with the beard that's hooked up with Sears now	3706	A
Villa or something like	3706	A
{doohinkey}	3706	A
New Yankee Workshop	3706	A
oh okay it's a series though	3706	A
huh	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
oh yeah he's got a he's got the sort of thing that that uh you know a professional shop would envy- envy more than likely	3706	A
if i had yes	3706	A
yeah well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do but it just takes more time and and a lot more talent when you have you got limited resources	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
oh yeah it's expensive stuff and	3706	A
last piece of hard wood that i bought was uh let's see a a one by ten by	3706	A
one- one inch by ten inch by four foot piece of uh	3706	A
of walnut	3706	A
oh beautiful piece of walnut	3706	A
and now- now for the life of me i don't know what i did with that board	3706	A
i carried it around i- i got it all sanded out and planed out and never did get done with what ever it was i'd originally planned to do with it and i think i wound up giving it to my little brother	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
anyway	3706	A
um-hum	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
i've	3706	A
well- it's one night a week and i think it's something you'd probably really enjoy	3706	A
i don't know i was uh thirty three and i and just started college	3706	A
and i mean going into it was like oh it sounds you know like it'd be fun but and i had all kinds of little buts that never really amounted to much but	3706	A
you know when i finally got into it i was so glad i did	3706	A
yeah	3706	A
yeah it it it's i mean hobbies like that are therapeutic too	3706	A
not a terrific amount to be honest with you uh	3706	B
i really don't have much in the way of tools i'd like to get a router and uh some other things like that but i really don't have much how about_1 yourself	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
you know i've made a just some simple things here just some shelves and uh	3706	B
saw horses you know nothing real complicated did a little bit of framing when i was going to you know in high school	3706	B
right yeah no uh uh home framing i guess that's not wood working that's construction i guess but in high school shop you know like every body had to build a couple of things and i really liked it i thought it was a lot of fun	3706	B
but you do need the tools i don't have much in the way of tools to be honest i don't have a table saw or a drill press or any of that kind of stuff	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
no i've got a drill and i think i got a jig saw and i got a a circular saw but	3706	B
oh	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
well that's kind of similar to what i've done uh had a father-in-law that got a bunch of uh uh real nice heavy doors from a motel that went out of business	3706	B
and uh they made a great table top so i made a nice work bench with a peg board back on it and	3706	B
pardon me	3706	B
yeah they're solid core and uh they they made a real terrific uh table top for a for a work bench there	3706	B
so you know it's real steady and	3706	B
well it's you know i watch this guy on TV once in a while	3706	B
is it the New Yankee oh no no it's this other guy it's called the New Yankee uh Workshop i don't know if you've ever seen him or not	3706	B
new Yankee- New Yankee	3706	B
i think that's what it's called but he makes uh mostly furniture items you know he'll make a a mirror or a chest of drawers or a table	3706	B
and uh it's fascinating to watch him work you know he does a terrific job but he's got every single thing you can imagine you know	3706	B
yeah yeah he's he's got all the all those things you'd like and	3706	B
and uh	3706	B
that's the problem i watch him do those things and i say you know i probably could do that given a little bit of experience yeah	3706	B
if i had five or ten thousand dollars in equipment like i'm sure he has	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
that- that's true you have to be better than than he is and that's hard to do what gets makes you a little nervous when you you know you're on a real nice piece of hard wood you don't wanna mess up on it	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
so	3706	B
um-hum	3706	B
oh	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
oh	3706	B
is that right	3706	B
well i've been tempted once in a while to uh i don't know you have these uh community education programs	3706	B
where you're adult education you can you can take a class in the evenings where you go at the local high school or the community college and sign up for a wood working class i've been tempted to do that	3706	B
i have some a friend that made a microwave stand and some you know some other kinds of things like that did a nice job and then you know then you can use their stuff	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
uh-huh	3706	B
yeah well well that's the one hobby i'd like to develop more i'll be honest with you uh	3706	B
it'd be	3706	B
yeah	3706	B
do you know you know what the topic is	3722	B
right	3722	B
i like uh pretty much rock popular rock	3722	B
what kind do you like	3722	B
um-hum um-hum	3722	B
um i can get into soft jazz too	3722	B
no	3722	B
country turns me off uh the my my girlfriend likes rap	3722	B
i don't like	3722	B
yeah definitely strange but uh i- i never got much i mean every so often there is like a song out that just sounds funny when you listen to it and those are probably the only kind i like but uh rap in general like i don't get into	3722	B
um i- i actually have a couple of favorite artists i- i like guys like you know Billy Joel uh who are singers song writers you know i mean who are	3722	B
yeah he's i- i love him i- i had his greatest hits uh and i had to have it on i have it on tape i have it on CD and i have it on record	3722	B
my tape went bad so i bought a record then my record went bad so i bought a CD	3722	B
probably Piano Man	3722	B
yeah i uh maybe- maybe just because it is like on i think it is the first one on the on the CD	3722	B
and it's the first one on the tape too and i just listen to it a lot and i just i just love it	3722	B
hm that is a good one	3722	B
you ever see the video uh by Billy Joel uh it's not it's uh another one about uh he is in a courtroom and he has you something like Keeping the Faith that's the name of the song and in the video he uh he's actually in court	3722	B
and and uh Christi Brinkley's in it yeah that's another reason i like him he's like married to the girl i love you know	3722	B
uh-huh	3722	B
right right	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
and i just got a kick out of it it was just really funny	3722	B
uh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah he	3722	B
he he just has the ability i mean every so often he'll just come out with uh you know a couple of the songs that are just great yeah	3722	B
no i haven't heard anything lately um but then again i haven't bought any CDs lately i had a CD player and i just moved from Washington about two years ago and uh when i was in Washington in DC i- i gave my CD player to my sister because_1 i was going to buy another one	3722	B
and and well i have one now but i just got it it's like two months ago so i- i just uh recently have started going back into the CD market	3722	B
yeah i got the the five disc carousel	3722	B
oh yeah	3722	B
um-hum um-hum	3722	B
oh yeah	3722	B
yeah i that's what i really like and i bought a little single disc for my car	3722	B
and uh that's great i mean i every since i put that thing in my car i haven't heard a tape since	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
well i just i just got a little portable one and i bought a little they Sony makes a base unit that you can just mount in your car and so the whole package was under two hundred dollars	3722	B
yeah otherwise i mean if you buy them_1 in a car now it's like five hundred bucks for a whole unit	3722	B
yeah yeah that's that's a little extravagant you know but if you can afford the cars that it can come into you know	3722	B
it's not that bad	3722	B
but	3722	B
i haven't been to any uh since i've been out of college um and it usually the concerts that have come up lately i have been out of town uh traveling so i just haven't had the chance to go to any	3722	B
you know and i work with a bunch of young people in the office they're always going to concerts but whenever they tell me there's one coming up there's something going on and i can never go	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
of who	3722	B
uh name- the name sounds familiar	3722	B
uh-huh	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
hum	3722	B
i think that's where i saw Yanni was there was something about him dating Linda Evans	3722	B
is it really hum	3722	B
um-hum	3722	B
hum	3722	B
okay uh	3722	A
music	3722	A
what type do you like	3722	A
okay	3722	A
uh i like rock semi classical soft jazz not heavy rock	3722	A
yeah i don't like uh country particularly or rap or um what else	3722	A
you're kidding	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
so who's your favorite artist right now	3722	A
great he's one of my favorites	3722	A
what-	3722	A
what is your very favorite song that Billy Joel has done	3722	A
really	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
my very favorite is still rock and roll to me	3722	A
yes i think so	3722	A
well then he has another video that she's been in uh he's like uh uh i think it is Uptown Girl and that's the first one that i had seen her in she is just so gorgeous	3722	A
uh-huh	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
well the other one that he came out with and i loved the video for it too uh it was i think on his last CD uh	3722	A
We Didn't Start the Fire	3722	A
oh i just love that song	3722	A
um-hum does he have anything new out do you know	3722	A
uh-huh	3722	A
and you never bought another one	3722	A
yes	3722	A
did you get one that loads more than one or did you get a single	3722	A
that's what we have and i'll tell you it's a lot nicer because you can you know sometimes i get tired of listening to the same artist over you know for the whole entire length of the CD and it's nice when you can randomly choose them_1 too	3722	A
um-hum um-hum	3722	A
yeah i'd like to have one of those next car i buy i don't know how expensive they are when you are putting them in	3722	A
uh-huh	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
oh that's great	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
ooh that might be a little bit more than my budget	3722	A
do you go to any concerts or anything	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
um-hum	3722	A
well there is someone that i just discovered like in the last couple of years and have you ever heard of Yanni	3722	A
Yanni	3722	A
he's a composer he's dating Linda Evans right now and he does i first heard when uh i first moved to Dallas about five years ago there was uh a station that played soft rock and light jazz	3722	A
and i did not think i liked jazz at all until i started listening to this station and Yanni is one of these- i guess he's kind of new {wavish} or something	3722	A
that's probably right exactly but his music is absolutely wonderful and i've kind of gotten into a little bit of this new age or new wave or whatever it may be and uh there's a lot of that that i like a	3722	A
the reason i was thinking about trials by jury and um i- i guess i thought more highly of it until the uh recent William Kennedy Smith case where they uh were telling about how they used um	3758	A
what they consider scientific methods to choose the right jurors to get the right results you know for their chance what do you think about that	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
yes	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
right	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
yes well i know um fairly recently when that um one of the court sessions for John Wylie Price i remember that um	3758	A
and though i had agreed with some of the things he did i- i disagreed with that particular case because he um	3758	A
they made they got a lot of mileage out that they that that was not a jury of his peers that um they said you know that he was found guilty and then	3758	A
he- uh then they made note that none of the the jurors were uh black or African- African American and	3758	A
and it seemed to me that if he wanted if they wanted that i mean they chose them deliberately i mean because of all of the publicity that it got from that	3758	A
and i really thought well you know one of their points that they made on purpose was they chose people who they felt were not their own peers in order to make the case against him weaker	3758	A
and it just seemed like it wasn't very fair that that you know that was something that could have been said at the very beginning and not cost the tax payers the money for that court	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
um-hum	3758	A
right	3758	A
right	3758	A
uh-huh	3758	B
um-hum	3758	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3758	B
well um you know it's it's like anything else i mean i guess i probably should mention i am an attorney and i and i although i don't do trial work now i have done so in the past and um	3758	B
i have to say that i've never been in the position to uh	3758	B
uh make use of uh the types of techniques but for years there have been uh books written that everybody has access to about techniques in jury- in jury selection	3758	B
and um you know uh i mean it kind of the way it kind of really actually works out in real life i don't think it's fair	3758	B
um necessarily for one side because they have a lot of money	3758	B
to be able to uh	3758	B
you- you know it it kind of it strikes me as as unfair that if you have got enough money you can pick the jury you want and really the system doesn't exactly allow that anyway	3758	B
the best- the best you get on jury selection is is if you've got to pick a jury of twelve people you get a certain number of what they call preemptory strikes and a certain number of of	3758	B
um each side gets those and and then there are are strikes you know an unlimited number of strikes for what they call for cause	3758	B
and uh	3758	B
you- you know obviously	3758	B
people whose whose livelihood depends on um	3758	B
jury jury trials are going to use whatever they can use to try uh to improve their chances and and you know it's get- it's	3758	B
the unfair part of it is that not everybody has access to the high powered technique but then then the the saving grace is that it can only get you so far	3758	B
i mean you know it- it you may find that the first three people on the panel are ideal jurors for you but the other side is probably going to even if i was sitting there with no	3758	B
um high-powered computer input and whatnot if i could just ask them_1 questions i could tell that they're gonna be good jurors for you and bad jurors for me i'm gonna strike them_1 so you're not going to get them_1	3758	B
i mean you can't really get what you want	3758	B
you can just improve your chances of guessing who you think you want	3758	B
uh-huh	3758	B
um-hum um-hum	3758	B
yeah well you know it's it's kind of been uh uh you see a lot in the death penalty cases	3758	B
that there a lot of the attorneys there are attorneys who strongly believe that the death penalty is not right	3758	B
and they um have pretty much dedicated themselves to doing everything they can to prevent uh people sentenced to the death penalty from being executed	3758	B
and they will go through endless appeals and one of the things that has been used and and it's been used most often um in in in the death penalty cases is the fact that	3758	B
you know that the the majority of people who are convicted if they're black they may not have any blacks or they might have one black on their jury panel	3758	B
and they have tried to statistically tie this to the likelihood of him getting the death penalty	3758	B
but they've never really been successful in it and the Supreme Court has has up to this point continued to reject those types of arguments	3758	B
saying that that somebody didn't get a fair trial because there wasn't a certain quota of blacks on the jury panel	3758	B
and i really do think that those arguments will continue to fail because	3758	B
guess what	3721	A
you know Diane Lancaster did you ever meet her she was at she was at your wedding	3721	A
okay- okay she is transcribing these tapes for TI	3721	A
no	3721	A
really hey Suzy how you doing	3721	A
oh this is too crazy well i i'm glad i'm glad it's you dear because whenever i first heard the topic i said oh no i hate to talk about finances and a budget	3721	A
no huh-uh i don't either no so that covers that so what's	3721	A
i know it i know it	3721	A
have	3721	A
but you've talked three different times	3721	A
yeah well great have-	3721	A
yes	3721	A
yeah do do you uh uh have- i was going to say have you gotten your first check yet	3721	A
and you've already had two calls	3721	A
then i'm just i gosh i'm just	3721	A
that's pretty good	3721	A
yeah well you need to start doing that	3721	A
but then again- then again if you're getting three calls and you hadn't made any then you really couldn't done much more than that	3721	A
yeah	3721	A
yeah we're recording	3721	A
yeah	3721	A
yeah well i- i went ahead and started it i said shoot might as well as long as we're talking i don't think it makes that much difference whether or not we talk about the exact topic you know what i mean	3721	A
i know it	3721	A
oh it's good it's good i uh i talked to uh uh my- the guy who's going to be my new boss today he called	3721	A
they had they were changing planes in New York coming back from uh Bermuda	3721	A
and uh it looks like what i'll do a week from today i'll go back to uh uh	3721	A
Houston	3721	A
then uh	3721	A
a week from today	3721	A
yeah and then uh probably the next week what i'm going to do and maybe for the next two weeks we're not sure yet i'm going to work in the Houston office then i'm going to be working with uh the crude department	3721	A
and uh learning what i'm going to need to be doing on on that side of the business	3721	A
not uh not long term then after a week or two in Houston i'll either come back to Miami or i'll go to Bermuda	3721	A
and uh i don't know it's still pretty loosey-goosey	3721	A
well what i'm i mean i'm working i mean like i would you know like i did at	3721	A
oh well shoot you know what one of the things about this i mean i- i don't get off work until uh well we don't well we don't leave the office until sometimes it's seven o'clock at night	3721	A
and we've been staying real late cause it's a lot going on	3721	A
and then for about oh gosh the first three nights i had dinners to go to	3721	A
you know we have to go out and dine	3721	A

uh-huh	3747	A
um-hum	3747	A
yeah Richard Jung Julio recorded an album at Saint Thomas Aquinas didn't he yeah	3747	A
well that's what that's mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are Romantic music Mahler and Ruckner and and Strauss	3747	A
uh i like i'm liking it more and more now	3747	A
getting used to it	3747	A
and mostly uh mostly Mozart	3747	A
i mean there's not- there's not any kind of trumpet parts but uh you know the	3747	A
i just like the melodies more and and and uh the libretto	3747	A
um yeah well i like Rossini better than Puccini	3747	A
i like more comic than	3747	A
no	3747	A
uh no i've never been to the Dallas Opera only the Fort Worth Opera	3747	A
and my trumpet teacher used to uh play in the Fort Worth Opera	3747	A
uh John Nelson	3747	A
uh-huh	3747	A
yeah he played in the Fort Worth Symphony in Fort Worth mostly	3747	A
yeah	3747	A
yeah	3747	A
uh	3747	A
um-hum	3747	A
which Church is it	3747	A
uh uh-huh	3747	A
it seems like a lot of churches are hiring more musicians now than they used to	3747	A
um-hum	3747	A
yes	3747	A
uh-huh	3747	A
but he's still teaching at Brookhaven isn't he	3747	A
oh yeah	3747	A
yeah because i heard Glen Bell taught at Plano as well	3747	A
uh-huh	3747	A
well seeing as how i'm a musician i like all kinds of music	3747	B
all very very kinds	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
well i like everything from hard core country to you know Wagner and Mahler and i like new age stuff i- i basically have a wide range of musical likes	3747	B
do you um	3747	B
are you musical uh are you a musician at all	3747	B
do you	3747	B
jazz	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
right	3747	B
well i love Baroque music so it's one of my favorite periods	3747	B
in fact i i sing with the Texas Baroque ensemble	3747	B
well we used to have um Ralph Dutchen but now he's in Massachusetts he's come back a couple of times then there's a trumpet player at North Texas the the teacher the main teacher	3747	B
yeah and he's played and the two of them have played natural trumpets and occasionally when she can't get those people we'll use you know just uh E flat trumpets	3747	B
with valves and like Glen Bell plays and	3747	B
uh Rick um	3747	B
Bogart's played too so	3747	B
but actually i like i like trumpet and organ together	3747	B
it's a nice combination	3747	B
yeah i think he did with Paul yeah	3747	B
he's wonderful both of them are	3747	B
so do you like Romantic music	3747	B
um-hum	3747	B
do you like opera	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
there's a	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
you don't like Puccini	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
uh-huh are you going to go see The Elixir of Love	3747	B
do you ever go to the Dallas Opera	3747	B
uh-huh	3747	B
who was your trumpet teacher	3747	B
uh-huh i know him i kind of know him is he still around here	3747	B
because_1 i don't i've not seen him playing anywhere lately but maybe it's because_1 he's playing in Fort Worth	3747	B
well i'm basically a church musician i do a church in Plano and we do all kinds of music at my church and we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for different things	3747	B
so i'm always making music of one kind or another	3747	B
uh it's at Christ United Methodist Church in Plano	3747	B
yeah most churches have the well there's some of the few organizations that have the funds to you know to do like big big works	3747	B
uh but we hire you know we hire an orchestra at least twice a year and then different instrumentalists off and on throughout the year	3747	B
that we have you know John Cuminado	3747	B
he plays at our church a lot	3747	B
in fact he is playing this Sunday at our church	3747	B
but he plays pretty regularly	3747	B
uh i think so he teaches a lot in Plano at high schools but i think he teaches at Brookhaven	3747	B
yeah Glen teaches here too they're the two of them are mainly pretty much the i think they've cornered the market on trumpet students	3747	B
well um uh that's something i've never thought a lot about um i've i work in a hospital and i've worked in the hospital for about fifteen years and i've taken care of a few AIDS patients	3798	B
um when they asked us did did we want to um	3798	B
keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh	3798	B
i think right now what- what they're spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion	3798	B
um because_1 i think it's something that's gonna take them_1 a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know	3798	B
and um so i don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now i think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know and uh what about you	3798	B
i'm not either i'm definitely not aware of how much	3798	B
uh it's something i've never really kept up with at all	3798	B
um i don't know-	3798	B
i'm not sure uh i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the research you know what i mean and uh that sort of thing	3798	B
um if if we were talking about the money um i'd just have to say	3798	B
oh yeah i think so i think so	3798	B
yeah yeah	3798	B
yeah well that's true that's true because um it's a such an easily preventable disease	3798	B
um	3798	B
no it's definitely not	3798	B
that's true that's true um myself um um i'm just recently or about to get a divorce	3798	B
and uh course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything but it's sort of scary	3798	B
to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know what's gonna happen you don't know who you're gonna come across you know course it's it's not that i'm wanting to	3798	B
i'm not gonna wanting to go and have sex with everybody i see but it's something you got to think about these days a single person	3798	B
you know and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry and um	3798	B
certainly yeah	3798	B
but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes	3798	B
and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything and uh i don't know i don't think that's a bad idea	3798	B
i know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction it just sort of keeps that going	3798	B
but um i don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be	3798	B
you know so i don't know that i think that's i'm not too- too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i don't know what do you think about that	3798	B
it's it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic	3798	B
um-hum	3798	B
that's true that's true	3798	B
yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an AIDS AIDS would have to have come first i guess as far as	3798	B
something to uh to do about it so so i don't know um course there's so many things in the world where	3798	B
if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know	3798	B
and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i don't know but um	3798	B
but i've never looked into how much money they're spending i have i have no idea	3798	B
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that	3798	B
but uh i really have never looked into it i have no idea um	3798	B
yeah	3798	B
yeah	3798	B
right sure	3798	B
yeah	3798	B
yeah i think it is i think it is	3798	B
yeah it does every it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know but uh	3798	B
uh that's one thing i've never really feared um uh i a lot of the my family	3798	B
you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions but um uh i don't fear it at all um i work in in the operating room a lot and um and of course when we	3798	B
well Michael what do you think about um funding for AIDS research do you	3798	A
oops	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
well i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now you know	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh yeah i mean i go ahead um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh yeah	3798	A
yeah yeah i mean i- i can see that research is needed and you know definitely i mean it's becoming a major problem	3798	A
but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know	3798	A
right and i- i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer it's it's uh abstinence in certain cases and yeah and knowing you know	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah i think for a lot of people it has so	3798	A
so	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
drug addicts um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
well yeah	3798	A
boy that's- that's a hard issue it really is	3798	A
yeah i mean i- i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um	3798	A
people i mean in the meantime well someone who's not ready to give up drugs um you know if they're perpetrating- perpetrating the AIDS problem passing that on to each other then you know	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
uh-huh yeah	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
yeah	3798	A
yeah i haven't either i've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough and mostly that's what i've heard so i don't know	3798	A
and yet i know it's um it sounds like big money to me but it probably takes a lot	3798	A
so	3798	A
um-hum yeah did you have any fear working in the hospital with that	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
uh-huh	3798	A
um-hum	3798	A
all right are you successful in finding a good mechanic to work on your car	3780	B
oh my	3780	B
i'm lucky to get that kind of mileage out of a car most of mine go belly up about eighty thousand miles	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
well i'm kind of hard on a car uh	3780	B
i find that in most cases the the service that you get particularly at the uh dealers	3780	B
uh at least in the Washington area is so bad that i'm i just hate to take a car in to have them_1 work on it	3780	B
so i generally run a car until it falls apart and and then i fix it	3780	B
uh i'm a electronics engineer	3780	B
no i uh travel very little so i have to do the uh commuting bit and get in the traffic jam every morning and evening	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
oh my yeah you can run up a hundred thousand miles without thinking about it	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
um-hum	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
well one of the funniest stories i remember is a boss that i had one time had an Alfa Romeo	3780	B
and he hit a bad railroad crossing somewhere and knocked the oil pan out on the car	3780	B
and he took it in to have the oil pan replaced and they replaced it and it was just leaking oil constantly	3780	B
and they he kept taking it back to get the oil pan fixed and uh they never could fix it	3780	B
and after about_1 a year and a half they finally realized that the pan that they'd replaced on that did not go with that serial number engine	3780	B
and so they ordered the right one	3780	B
and he came in all beaming and proud that this thing had finally been fixed and hadn't used a drop of oil in the last four or five days	3780	B
and uh	3780	B
well he would go out at lunchtime and he for months afterwards he'd come back and he'd look at his parking spot at his office and there was this puddle of oil there	3780	B
and he couldn't figure out what was going on he'd check his oil and you know it would still be up there and it hadn't used- hadn't added any oil but there was this oil slick in his parking spot	3780	B
well what he didn't know was the mechanical engineer that worked for him was kind of a mischievous type person	3780	B
and every lunchtime when he'd go out to lunch the mechanical- the mechanical engineer would go into the shop and he'd get the used oil and come out and pour it in his parking spot	3780	B
i don't think he ever did i think that mechanic went someplace else to work before the oil slick ever cleared up	3780	B
yeah he he was wondering where that oil was coming from he's checking his dipstick every day	3780	B
well every time i hear somebody buying an MG i ask them_1 if they uh they paid the extra price to get the tool kit	3780	B
yeah	3780	B
well i just uh i have a Thunderbird that i spent last month twelve hundred bucks just on getting repairs to	3780	A
but that's that's a that's a hundred thousand mile tune-up so i guess if it'll gives me another fifty thousand in between i'll be happy with it	3780	A
but uh	3780	A
well uh i tell you it's expensive if you uh try and keep them_1 running you know keep them_1 so they're in in top shape	3780	A
uh	3780	A
i don't know-	3780	A
well	3780	A
well what do you what do you do	3780	A
uh-huh i mean do you have travel a lot in your job or not	3780	A
oh okay	3780	A
and that's good and hard on a car	3780	A
yeah it uh i uh i cover most of Texas and Oklahoma with some of the lines that i sell and and i'll put on thirty five forty thousand miles a year	3780	A
but uh	3780	A
it	3780	A
and you got to keep the car in good shape when you do that uh and- i- i'm on my third set of tires on this thing and	3780	A
uh	3780	A
yeah	3780	A
brake job and you know shocks you you do the whole thing if you want to keep it going and about_1 the only real aggravation was when they had a uh	3780	A
it turned out they had to change processor out on the car which doesn't seem that difficult a thing to do	3780	A
but it took them_1 a week before they realized that they had	3780	A
two other bad processors and uh without a car for a week in my business it's rather difficult	3780	A
i- i guess the only thing that really bothers me and uh the auto at least down here and it sounds like you got the same problem where uh	3780	A
they only have probably one really qualified mechanic in the whole garage and uh the rest are	3780	A
maybe a level above or perhaps at the grease monkey level and yet they'll they'll charge you for brain surgery on these cars as though they all know everything	3780	A
okay but	3780	A
that's a good one oh that's nasty	3780	A
just driving this guy crazy probably couldn't sleep at night worrying about his expensive car getting blown up and	3780	A
that is funny that is funny i got a customer that uh	3780	A
has a Jaguar and he and his wife have one he says well if you have a Jaguar you got to have two one for the shop and one to drive	3780	A
oh well i don't know uh	3780	A
what age you are but when i was a kid the cars you could you could fix them_1 you know i when i was in college i recall one time	3780	A
okay	3723	B
oh	3723	B
oh	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
um-hum	3723	B
well i understand that i've been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and i thought that'd be the time to get going	3723	B
and uh so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York and so she's not around	3723	B
and i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i don't seem to find time in the day time and of course it's motivation that's keeping me from really looking for that opportunity	3723	B
oh yeah	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah yeah well more than weight course i could use uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that i also notice i just feel better when i exercise	3723	B
and that's something that i'm motivated about now because_1 i do need to get myself feeling better and just in better shape but	3723	B
i um all the same it's connected to my attitude because i'm not feeling as perky and good i'm also it's hard to get my attitude to to get myself out there	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah yeah	3723	B
and you have less- less chance of of hurting yourself	3723	B
yeah yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because_1 she's supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then i had	3723	B
pulled a muscle in my knee actually i hyper extended it or something and uh boy i was suffering for a good three weeks later	3723	B
oh is it	3723	B
yeah yeah	3723	B
uh-huh	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
yeah well i've got a dog now and and of course she needs walking and so that's a little less try you know- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to and	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
oh yeah	3723	B
yeah	3723	B
that's kind of an idea uh we	3723	B
we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center that's got a walking track that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year	3723	B
but i find it very tedious because i'm watching the clock constantly and it's just nothing else to look at and i actually get more tired doing that than	3723	B
i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good and there i could barely make a couple miles	3723	B
okay i was watching the soap opera awards um and and it's it's really making me wanna exercise because_1 every single woman in the audience is	3723	A
about_1 ten pounds	3723	A
so um i started anchoring last up anchoring uh exercising last	3723	A
about_1 last Spring when i- i joined the President's Health Club and i was really motivated and going and i went uh for a little while uh	3723	A
i went pretty regularly but it's hard to go regularly for a long time	3723	A
and where i live in Waco uh they don't have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's so now i don't have a club and i'm i don't have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly	3723	A
or something like that so i'm not exercising at the time at the moment so i wish i could i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that but	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
um	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
i think a lot of times if you have someone	3723	A
to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh	3723	A
sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that and that would keep you going	3723	A
um-hum um-hum	3723	A
oh yeah	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
that's very true it seems like you walk quicker and you just perky is a good word for it when you when you exercise	3723	A
and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because_1 it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't	3723	A
yeah it doesn't you know hurt you like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that	3723	A
so	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
wow	3723	A
wow	3723	A
yeah	3723	A
uh oh	3723	A
huh i guess my favorite- my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes to go yeah just- with the the stationary bikes to just ride	3723	A
and if you're watching television they usually have television in there or something or if you're listening to a walkman it's pretty it's pretty okay	3723	A
again that's sort of weird because_1 you're you've not going anywhere and it- i- i used to play racquetball and i really loved that because though it to me it had a point	3723	A
oh yeah	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
hum	3723	A
yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls	3723	A
you know like early in the mornings things like that- i never tried that	3723	A
i don't know i've i never really even thought about it really	3723	A
oh	3723	A
oh	3723	A
um-hum	3723	A
um	3723	A
okay what do you do- consider as as camping	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
hm	3793	A
um-hum um-hum well the only camping the only camping i've done really is living in a tent we used- used to go to Lake Shasta like fifteen years in a row	3793	A
and uh you know take everything up there park our car unload the car and then go by boat to the camp spot you know two or three trips back to the car to unload everything	3793	A
and uh the	3793	A
no no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called Calucci Creek	3793	A
and um you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent	3793	A
and uh slept in in the tent you know on	3793	A
well	3793	A
you know what it is it's actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in that's what we use to put around our john	3793	A
yeah	3793	A
it was like two weeks	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
uh it was	3793	A
well just it was it was nice for a while but after fifteen years i got tired of it	3793	A
and then my next my next vacation trip was to Hawaii	3793	A
right right	3793	A
but uh	3793	A
i've never gone anyplace else really except Lake Shasta camping you know	3793	A
no Patterson's down by Modesto	3793	A
it's like twenty minutes away from- i used to live in Oakland	3793	A
uh and um	3793	A
used to go camping all the time up there but i've lived down here in Patterson now since eighty eight	3793	A
you know	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum do you have little kids that like to	3793	A
oh uh-huh	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
it's fun for kids though isn't it	3793	A
you know	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
um-hum well i'm ready to go camping again i- i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup deer hunting	3793	A
uh over a weekend so know lived in a camper on that	3793	A
yeah that's that's not too bad at least you're inside you don't have to worry about the bears and	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
um-hum um-hum but	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
yeah	3793	A
it it- it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven't been up to Yosemite for God i don't know how many years i would love to go up there again	3793	A
um-hum	3793	A
yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic	3793	A
it was a long time ago that i went there but i've only been there once	3793	A
you know	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
um-hum um-hum	3793	A
yeah yeah but it's beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the stars- all the stars up there and everything compared to uh you know living in the city-	3793	A
yes	3793	B
well um	3793	B
we've done a lot of tent camping that's probably the closest definition that i usually think of but um there are a couple of places in the San Francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are	3793	B
sort of like rustic cabins they have no um electricity and no water	3793	B
but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and	3793	B
you can spread out sleeping bags on on uh wooden surfaces so	3793	B
it's a pseudo cabin but they call it environmental camping	3793	B
we really enjoy that	3793	B
oh that's beautiful	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
is it one when you've been there is it one of those uh state park arrangements where	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
oh	3793	B
i don't think i've ever seen a john tent that's	3793	B
that's more rustic camping perhaps than i've done usually where someplace where we're sort of close to	3793	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3793	B
that's great do you usually spend then quite a few days	3793	B
oh wow	3793	B
how do you like that i don't think i've ever been camping quite that long that seems like	3793	B
without showers and all you how how did you	3793	B
how did you enjoy that	3793	B
so it was sort of an annual thing every year for a while	3793	B
sounds like fun thing about Shasta too is there's so many other things that you can do	3793	B
uh-huh is Patterson fairly close to Shasta	3793	B
oh okay	3793	B
oh well	3793	B
yeah	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
there are a lot of uh camping grounds county and state facilities in the Santa Cruz mountains south of here so	3793	B
tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes	3793	B
we have one two year old so actually we'd been camping for a long time before she was born and just now introducing her to her it to her rather	3793	B
yeah they really enjoy it i think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and	3793	B
i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so	3793	B
hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do	3793	B
uh-huh	3793	B
um-hum that's that's kind of fun we did that once in Yosemite too	3793	B
right that was one good reason in Yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure	3793	B
yes in fact i've never been camping at all in Yosemite outside of the uh the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins	3793	B
that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but	3793	B
yeah it's a beautiful place i think i worry that it's changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular	3793	B
do you remember it a a long time ago i don't know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or	3793	B
oh uh-huh	3793	B
my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little um and that at that time there really weren't delegated- designated campsites so um	3793	B
people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their their terrain and	3793	B
it's a little bit better arrangement today	3793	B
um-hum um-hum	3793	B
okay and you want to talk about this weather wow i wanna talk about how mild it was at Christmas time	3778	B
well that was uh totally unbelievable for the first time in a long time i left plants outside and they didn't freeze so that was pretty good um yeah	3778	B
yeah	3778	B
oh you did oh that's terrible	3778	B
well what'd you do to prepare for that	3778	B
i see	3778	B
oh you did oh good for you uh-huh	3778	B
no i um that happened to a friend of ours actually they have a condominium and um they- they went out to the grocery store and were out for oh a couple of hours	3778	B
and when they came home the the pipe had broken and their their ground floor was flooded so uh it it's it's a major horror when when that kind of thing occurs	3778	B
oh	3778	B
oh oh no uh-huh	3778	B
oh my goodness isn't that terrible thing yeah	3778	B
oh	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
yeah oh oh my goodness well	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
well you know sometimes in a funny kind of way life treats us like that that something we wouldn't normally do when we're placed in the circumstance we go ahead and do it and then	3778	B
uh things are kind of better afterwards and it it ultimately gives you an uplift i i i guess you have to look at it like that anyway or you might get depressed and God forbid but anyway	3778	B
but uh we had visitors from New York i'm really not from this area you must detect that i'm really- originally from the New York area and we had visitors uh both from New York and from California at Christmas time	3778	B
and um usually it is uh somewhat cold i mean cold enough to put on a winter coat or at least heavy sweaters and it was so mild here that uh they had to of course	3778	B
poke several funny jokes at us down here with this funny weather and you know whatever uh but uh i think they were very uh pleasantly happy because one person has um	3778	B
uh arthritis kind of stuff and um	3778	B
when it gets very cold they all crink up you know and uh we didn't have any of that kind of problem this year so we were uh very grateful for that kind of thing	3778	B
that's right um-hum yeah uh-huh of course in California they have such a steadily more moderate climate that the temperatures even in the areas around San Francisco we used to live	3778	B
down in that Bay area the temperatures never got excessively cold if it got down around thirty two just about	3778	B
uh then the people would start panicking over the artichoke uh crops and uh avocados and of course down south the	3778	B
the orange groves and things like that you know the weather really does have a lot of effect on so many things and um when they grow those oranges down in the southlands they have these	3778	B
braziers out in the field and they go around putting fires on if the temperatures gets down around thirty two or thirty and just levels off there so that	3778	B
they can uh regulate it by means of those like man made not too difficult um uh ways to to save the crops	3778	B
yeah	3778	B
um-hum	3778	B
uh-huh	3778	B
right of course uh-huh	3778	B
oh oh yes oh it's it's really well that happened here in Texas with the grapefruits that year a couple of years ago	3778	B
and the grapefruit crop was very uh very scarce uh so uh you know all of these major things the poor farmers but um	3778	B
anyway we'll just uh hope that uh we're not in for too many big freezes now but i know one big one will come	3778	B
and in it always does and uh i really don't mind those uh few uh snow flurries and those few days when there's a bit of snow	3778	B
okay	3778	A
yeah it's something else	3778	A
yeah how about_1 that huh	3778	A
yes	3778	A
yeah that's true uh the- i think it was last year around this time it was when we had the really really hardened cold snap	3778	A
i had a pipe break on me so it flooded the house and everything	3778	A
so i was trying to be prepared this time around	3778	A
uh well it was an outside pipe so now- this time i made sure i wrapped them_1 up real good um-hum	3778	A
i don't wanna go through that again	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
ah	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
well with us we were out of town over the Christmas holiday and our neighbor called us to say hey you guys did you leave the water running	3778	A
yeah they saw the the water coming out from under the door	3778	A
yeah so we cut our vacation short but i guess it wasn't too bad uh we ended up getting all new carpet downstairs and part of the upstairs so	3778	A
it wasn't it wasn't a real pleasant but uh you know looking back it- it was a good deal because we did need new carpet	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
exactly	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
that's true	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
oh	3778	A
sure sure	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum um-hum	3778	A
that's great	3778	A
yeah so you had the kind of weather that uh it was nice to go out at night on	3778	A
yeah that's great	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
um-hum um-hum	3778	A
hum oh	3778	A
i see	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
right	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
hum	3778	A
wow	3778	A
um-hum	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
right right that's right you know uh you- you usually don't think of that uh you know being i guess being in a urban area if it gets cold you know	3778	A
you- you well let's think about water freezing and pipes breaking but down there they got all those crops to worry about	3778	A
yeah yeah right- i remember that	3778	A
that's right	3778	A
right	3778	A
yeah	3778	A
it always happens huh	3778	A
sure i'd say there's pretty- quite pretty-	3778	A
okay_1 i guess we start talking about the budget	3739	A
okay you you live near the nation's capital what can we do about this mess	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
i see big opportunities in Europe opening up uh it just it just seems to me like we ought to be able to go over there and help the people become a capitalistic society	3739	A
uh	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
yeah	3739	A
another thing i think the uh that the President could do right now on a short term basis to get things speeded up is	3739	A
help out the working people right now the middle income people uh give them_1 some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i	3739	A
basically remember getting some sort of tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car	3739	A
uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate	3739	A
well i've always believed in paying my fair share of of of taxes oh and whatever my government says is my fair share is what i think i should pay	3739	A
uh i don't necessarily agree with people who go out of their way to find loopholes and not paying their fair share	3739	A
yeah the lady who does my taxes for me every year it seems like she's got a new suggestion	3739	A
and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i don't uh since i no longer work uh usually it's not very complicated anymore but uh	3739	A
i no longer work uh oh it's been almost three years ago i had some uh strange heart problems occur	3739	A
and uh so i'm more or less hang around the house and uh that sort of thing	3739	A
yeah it's uh	3739	A
i know for the i thought maybe i would go back to work especially during that first year and then they finally decided that then maybe i'll never work again	3739	A
so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially and things like that i can no longer afford things that maybe i used to take for granted	3739	A
and i certainly can't invest money like i used to	3739	A
well	3739	A
what kind of work did you do when you were working	3739	A
oh yeah	3739	A
very good sir	3739	B
well uh living near the nation's capital unfortunately doesn't do you any good uh all i all i uh find that i can do is read the newspapers and try to decide what's best for us	3739	B
what we need to do and that's sort of a function of the economy	3739	B
and our relationship with uh other countries and so forth and right now we're in this big change since Russia has undergone such a uh big uh renegotiation within themselves	3739	B
and i'm sure that we haven't quite decided where we stand in that yet	3739	B
yes i think they're looking for that they just need guidance yes that would be very good for us to help	3739	B
show them what it what it takes to have a a capitalistic society and one in which each of them has a a say and uh you know can express their thoughts safely	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
oh i don't recall ever getting a rebate but it does seem as though if if we are able to	3739	B
reduce the our expenditures for defense course we've got to get get this big debt that the country has under control	3739	B
and if as we get that under control then i'd like to see the taxes that we pay reduced	3739	B
a certain amount you know so that we're all comfortable but i do believe that the country's gonna have to get itself straightened out {debtwise} before uh they could do too much that way	3739	B
but i hate to see them_1 raise the taxes if it's unnecessary	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
sure that makes sense	3739	B
yes it it it seems as though a lot of the things that we see in the paper and in letters that you receive are showing you loopholes or how not to pay your share and that really is sort of against what the whole ball game's about isn't it	3739	B
um-hum	3739	B
you no longer work	3739	B
oh my	3739	B
well you have more experience at that than i i just retired from working myself on December thirty first so i haven't really had time to look at it from the retiree point of view	3739	B
but it'll be an interesting uh concept i'm sure	3739	B
hm	3739	B
yes that	3739	B
i understand well it's unfortunate you had that problem and i do hope you will be able to work out your circumstances so that you can live comfortably and feel confident that you are doing your share of the taxes	3739	B
and you know still there are certain things that you need to do in your family and yourself	3739	B
to enjoy life to its fullest	3739	B
i was working uh in doing research for the government	3739	B
so i know what it's like i had worked for the government basically i'm actually i'm a professor a retired professor at Penn State	3739	B
and uh but my work has always been in research uh related uh to the government so i'm i'm aware of what it takes to perform the work that's needed	3739	B
and	3739	B
the government has got to decide what it needs to know and then set up the criteria by which problems are solved and and uh the	3739	B
um i i'm pretty flexible i- i could like- i like just about everything minus um hard rock	3712	B
and i don't really like um	3712	B
rap	3712	B
but i like classical jazz um you know um	3712	B
contemporary i don't know what you call it i guess light rock or easy listening or whatever what about you	3712	B
hang on excuse- me <b_aside> Rusty no <e_aside>	3712	B
my dog's getting in the trash okay go ahead	3712	B
um-hum	3712	B
um-hum	3712	B
and who who in the Christian contemporary do you like to listen to	3712	B
uh-huh	3712	B
uh-huh	3712	B
i don't either unless i know that i like uh you know a lot of the music on a particular cassette	3712	B
but i do uh my husband's from Latin America and uh so i listen to Salsa which is typical of where he's from and	3712	B
and it it's a really lively fun music you'll you'll find yourself just moving just listening to it	3712	B
it's it's fun but mostly i'll listen to uh	3712	B
i guess i listen to easy listening in the car but if i am at home i'll listen to i don't know if if not jazz you know it'll be some type of uh	3712	B
like i was talking about you know the music from his area or um i like gospel music i listen to a lot of i like a cappella gospel	3712	B
there's a group called Take Six that that does some really lovely stuff and some of it is a little too um	3712	B
it's too i mean it- it's- it's too much along the lines of of a lot of black music it's too uh it's not rap but it's just not enough gospel for me but their first um works that came out i really enjoyed them	3712	B
yeah i have heard of him the name rings familiar i don't know why though	3712	B
um-hum	3712	B
hm well that sounds nice	3712	B
yeah i like classical guitar too um Strings and Fur i don't know if you heard of them they are not exactly classical but they have got some really lovely music out that is along those lines	3712	B
and who else God i've got we've got a couple really good um tapes i cannot remember who else	3712	B
there's another group called Gypsy Kings that i listen to that it's- it's in Spanish but even if you don't understand it it sings a lot of stuff that that anybody's familiar with like you remember the song Volare oh well anyways	3712	B
i remember the song and um you know it's a lot of guitar type of uh from Spain type stuff it's really beautiful	3712	B
yeah	3712	B
yes i have i have i don't have any of his work but i do like like it i have heard it on the Oasis	3712	B
have you	3712	B
uh-huh	3712	B
yeah	3712	B
um yeah there's there's a little bit- of- that- bit of that in there	3712	B
yeah-	3712	B
exactly well i think we have covered it	3712	B
what do you think	3712	B
it was nice talking to you too have a good evening bye-bye	3712	B
well Wendy what kind of music do you like	3712	A
um-hum	3712	A
um-hum	3712	A
um-hum um a lot the same i don't like hard rock at all and i uh don't like um	3712	A
rap either i don't care too much for jazz sometimes a few things i have heard that i like but	3712	A
okay	3712	A
and um i like classical and i like um	3712	A
a lot of different kinds of contemporary um folksy type where you can hear the words and um you know where there are something they're saying	3712	A
um i guess my preference is um well either classical or Christian contemporary or uh praise type songs	3712	A
um i don't have a particular favorite i um	3712	A
i like some of the music that's put out by Hosannah um Integrity tapes they're instrumental mostly um where they just have um	3712	A
praise songs and it's set to just instruments or um praise songs with words um	3712	A
there's a few things i don't pay too much attention i turn the radio on and i don't always pay attention to who is singing what i just know there's a song here a song there i like i don't spend a lot of money buying tapes and stuff so	3712	A
yeah	3712	A
yeah	3712	A
uh-huh	3712	A

um	3712	A
um-hum	3712	A
um-hum have your ever heard of John Michael Talbot	3712	A
yeah	3712	A
yeah i guess i he's one that at least i know you know if i hear his name i'll probably like it cause i he just has a real	3712	A
quiet reflective i think he just accompanies himself on the guitar and uh classical guitar and i really like classical guitar yeah	3712	A
hm uh-huh	3712	A
yeah i think so uh-huh uh-huh	3712	A
yeah have you ever heard of um a Venezuelan he's local but he's cut a couple of albums now or whatever you call them_1 these days CDs i guess	3712	A

oh yeah and and what kind of books do you read	3760	B
oh yeah	3760	B
oh do you like those detective stories	3760	B
oh well that's interesting i- i actually like to read also but	3760	B
i usually fall into one of two categories either	3760	B
true science fiction or fantasy on one hand or highly technical	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
kind of one or the other	3760	B
i	3760	B
i do yes	3760	B
yeah and i'm a computer scientist	3760	B
but i have a lot of other hobbies i- i well yeah i- i i'm kind of um	3760	B
i- i guess what you'd call it a project person yeah and i love i like i have a shop and	3760	B
when things break around the house i always try and fix them_1 myself and so hobby it's- it's- it's its funny uh from the one stand point it's work	3760	B
but it's a hobby too that that i enjoy to do to find broken	3760	B
well essentially anything you'd find in a house	3760	B
uh a a stove or an oven or a broken piece of porcelain or uh	3760	B
chipped tile on the floor i mean just anything	3760	B
well it's it's not anything elaborate it's just a work bench with a gazillion tools	3760	B
but enough that	3760	B
again for anything in the house i can probably	3760	B
right	3760	B
and in the car i guess the car too	3760	B
so that's i- i think i would probably consider that a hobby although sometimes it gets to be excessive	3760	B
yeah i	3760	B
right yeah i- i think it it	3760	B
it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances	3760	B
so do you have any artistic- um i wanna- i guess i wanna say creative or artistic hobbies	3760	B
oh yeah well that's good	3760	B
yeah well i don't necessarily either i can plink out a song or two on a piano and i can	3760	B
um i- i don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art i guess graphics arts is that what that would be called it i can't like do any of that but sweat shirts is certainly impressive	3760	B
um-hum	3760	B
oh yeah	3760	B
oh yeah	3760	B
uh-huh	3760	B
i see well that's neat that's a i guess i consider that a hobby do you do you cook for a hobby or do you	3760	B
do you	3760	B
that's something you	3760	B
i understand that	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
uh right	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
but i think that still borders on hobby	3760	B
probably the other thing i do which	3760	B
i'm sure it'll sound horrible to you but is i program for fun on my computer	3760	B
so i'll i have little projects little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies	3760	B
but drive my wife crazy	3760	B
i do yes	3760	B
in fact there's actually several of them here right now not not all of them being mine	3760	B
yeah	3760	B
so uh i wonder if you you could construe raising children as being a hobby	3760	B
um-hum	3760	B
okay um we're guess we're supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time um	3760	A
i basically read books	3760	A
what i do sometimes when everybody's off gone to bed my kids are in bed my husband in bed i just every once in a while i'll just stay up and	3760	A
finish a book that i'm i usually have about three books that i'm going on i'll work on one for a little bit you know and then on the next one but that's kind of	3760	A
not always just sometimes	3760	A
um just really different ones um	3760	A
i had one that i was reading on um raising your children and another one on a	3760	A
on a biography and another one on a um	3760	A
um like a crime story you know a truth crime story	3760	A
yeah but it this this is a true one it was this seemed a little different so i was reading that one last night	3760	A
yeah its like my husband	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
you must uh work for TI yeah my husband does too	3760	A
yeah it gets	3760	A
uh-huh really	3760	A
oh really	3760	A
yeah yeah like what kinds of things do you fix	3760	A
oh and you have a shop	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah you can fix just about everything and anything	3760	A
well that's great	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah that's that's pretty much like my husband he's	3760	A
he's pretty uh mobile in that area too he he works on the cars we barely take them_1 in	3760	A
he works on irons- irons and all those TV's and stuff too we rarely have to take those things in too	3760	A
oh yeah yeah definitely	3760	A
um	3760	A
gosh not really i mean i during Christmas i work on you know like	3760	A
um holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things but	3760	A
but um	3760	A
not really	3760	A
oh	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
uh-huh	3760	A
um i belong to this organization for um with- if you have preschool children you know	3760	A
and uh every once and a while they'll have a a craft um session for the moms	3760	A
and those are really neat and we learned to do the um transfer pictures on the sweatshirts	3760	A
transfer photos and um those are really neat so we learn different crafts like that um	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
no i cook dinner and its not i don't consider it a hobby but um	3760	A
you know i no i'm not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately i like to bake off and on and usually once a week i'll bake something but its not	3760	A
anything elaborate you know	3760	A
at least i don't think it is	3760	A
so	3760	A
yeah	3760	A
uh-huh	3760	A
uh-huh	3760	A
oh	3760	A
well good you have a computer at home	3760	A
oh good yeah	3760	A
oh really	3760	A
wow then you are busy	3760	A
wow that's really good	3760	A
well you know one of the books that i did read- that i was reading and i stopped because it's so	3760	A
its the book is so detailed and you have to sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again because i didn't quite get it all	3760	A
and uh it is so detailed	3760	A
who uh does your family keep a budget at all or	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
ah	3705	A
ah	3705	A
huh	3705	A
oh really	3705	A
uh-huh	3705	A
you-	3705	A
three extra days you'd a yeah	3705	A
about it huh yeah we've uh we've been trying to save for a house we've been really trying to penny pinch and	3705	A
i tell you it gets tough when you know we have i've tried to write something out on a computer and stuff but it seems like every week there's something that comes up and makes it about impossible to	3705	A
car breaks down or somebody gets sick or	3705	A
exactly	3705	A
but	3705	A
are you uh are you able to plan or save anything for the healthy future or no i know it it's a day to day thing	3705	A
yeah i know all that's we i have my wife and a daughter and	3705	A
it's about impossible	3705	A
well that's good to hear	3705	A
and there's nothing you can do about it huh	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
yeah it makes you wonder how they get it all i mean	3705	A
oh do you	3705	A
huh	3705	A
just it	3705	A
yeah well that's what's amazed us is we've been trying to get into a house and i just i just with what we make a payment i mean it's about double what we pay for rent i just can't see how people do it these days	3705	A
so	3705	A
well it's actually Utah's been lucky we haven't been hit by the recession so housing prices have stayed up the only thing that's helping us is that the mortgage rates are going down but uh it's still moving pretty brisk and	3705	A
i say we've been kind of lucky we haven't been hit with the same kind of stuff that the rest of the nation has	3705	A
we've been able to stay out of you know that we haven't lost many jobs or anything like that up around	3705	A
yeah that nursing	3705	A
um-hum	3705	A
oh do you you just work on call huh	3705	A
huh	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
oh yeah definitely	3705	A
definitely sounds	3705	A
yeah but it sounds like you've been doing all right with it so	3705	A
um-hum	3705	A
yeah so do you have a family or	3705	A
oh do you	3705	A
enough to keep you kind of busy yeah	3705	A
yeah that's true yeah i uh that's what uh	3705	A
you know we're trying to we well i mean we've got a long ways off before school starts my daughter's just eighteen months but	3705	A
you know you think about it i had to struggle my whole time through college you know pay for my own and get an occasional grant here and there but	3705	A
i just don't know how you know they can ever do it in ten years fifteen years from now when i have to go and	3705	A
yeah	3705	A
and a small little you know two bedroom home with you know five hundred square feet is about sixty thousand it seems like and those are pretty hefty payments to	3705	A
well that's in Utah like i say i think we're we're probably below the market for the most part we're pretty lucky that way but	3705	A
hasn't it	3705	A
uh-huh	3705	A
ooh	3705	A
oh that's not bad	3705	A
um-hum	3705	A
i just know what my bills are and	3705	B
how much i need for that and what's extra i'm a nurse and so i kind of figure i'm taking home a hundred dollars a day	3705	B
so when i look at things like to buy or anything i think of it in days	3705	B
oh that's a good one	3705	B
well that's what happens that's exactly what happens it	3705	B
um-hum um-hum so just when you think you might get a little ahead that's right that's what happens	3705	B
so that's kind of hard but	3705	B
no no not at all	3705	B
not at all i- i barely get by	3705	B
have more money and some don't and that's it so uh-huh and and i'm lucky i have a very low mortgage payment because_1 i- i had my house for a long time and	3705	B
i don't have a car payment and you know i- i don't have a lot of things so i'm pretty lucky but i have to make- come up with the money totally by myself so that's hard too you know	3705	B
yeah how is housing there	3705	B
yeah	3705	B
yeah yeah	3705	B
yeah well i'm lucky i'll never lose	3705	B
but you know it doesn't matter if i lose a job one place i'll just go somewhere else so	3705	B
yeah	3705	B
oh oh yeah really and and they get a little picky in one place and	3705	B
i know where i am now there's a whole big new administration and they're they're scaring everybody to death but i don't work on staff i just work on call	3705	B
and- um-hum and so i have a couple of agencies that i work for and i make much more money that way and i can be independent i don't have to go to all the meetings and get into the politics and	3705	B
i don't get the benefits but i think it's more than worth it then i just pay for that so yeah it's a great thing but it's risky and most people don't wanna	3705	B
do that	3705	B
yeah i've i feel like it you know and it's much more interesting that way too you don't get burned out so much so	3705	B
oh	3705	B
well i know what you mean it does look impossible you look around you and i don't know how young people buy houses today or anything i really don't know and	3705	B
oh that's terrible	3705	B
yeah	3705	B
oh yeah well it's not too bad in this area really the thing is there's a lot of money and like i'm in Plano so it's a little bit north of Dallas but	3705	B
but there's so much money in this town and there are things that are three hundred and five hundred thousand and lots and lots of them	3705	B
but you can buy a nice three bedroom home for like eighty thousand	3705	B
so it really isn't it's low compared to the rest of the country you know and there's all kinds of	3705	B
oh really i i've spent three years um teaching in public schools and elementary school	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
i taught in Utah and uh	3776	B
did you teach in California	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
you sound pretty young for a university professor	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
um-hum	3776	B
well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because_1 i don't think we did that in Utah	3776	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
uh-huh yeah	3776	B
true	3776	B
um-hum um-hum	3776	B
yeah i see what you're saying yeah i totally agree	3776	B
oh yeah	3776	B
uh-huh	3776	B
well i've i haven't taught in Iowa but i've taught in Utah and um	3776	B
people there were saying that	3776	B
the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home	3776	B
or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids yeah well	3776	B
well uh maybe it was the area i was in but a lot of schools had lot of transient um families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side and	3776	B
yeah and i mean like you said how they were the schools were doing more things for the kids	3776	B
they thought than they were thirty years ago i mean they were the school i was teaching at the the year i left they're considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids	3776	B
as well as hot lunch and	3776	B
i uh spent four years as a university professor and yeah	3776	A
oh do you really that's great	3776	A
no kidding	3776	A
what-	3776	A
i did i did um	3776	A
well i was pretty young well- i was uh i had never intended to do it and i was uh	3776	A
uh given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system	3776	A
at any rate um the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is um	3776	A
research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning	3776	A
have you ever	3776	A
well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and uh what what it involves basically	3776	A
is the use of peer groups and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person	3776	A
to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh	3776	A
gain a competence with respect to the material	3776	A
um i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution	3776	A
in the way we learn uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system	3776	A
uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators	3776	A
and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results so my feeling is that um	3776	A
the the problem is is	3776	A
uh significant there are plenty of good people uh available to	3776	A
um offer people educational experience but that we just have to reallocate- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and uh i think	3776	A
certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um	3776	A
uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning	3776	A
and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually i don't know what form it'll ultimately take	3776	A
um	3776	A
uh but i think that	3776	A
the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for	3776	A
uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that	3776	A
uh	3776	A
i- i don't	3776	A
i don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it as- both as quote unquote students and as teachers	3776	A
but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities	3776	A
in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh you must see kids with real significant problems um in some cases	3776	A
uh course Iowa City i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City is it is it uh deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or	3776	A
right	3776	A
even in Utah	3776	A
well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe	3776	A
yeah you see- you saw a fair number of troubled kids	3776	A
yeah	3776	A
yeah	3776	A
okay yeah Donna um you said you have three children what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them is it you know	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
uh-huh that's neat	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
so do you find it difficult to find time or is it pretty natural uh-huh	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah yeah do you work during the day	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
i can imagine yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
uh-huh	3720	A
yeah so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in America	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
oh that's good yeah	3720	A
yeah well families are facing a challenge i know that with i'm a newlywed and we're you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years and	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah but i do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because_1	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
um-hum	3720	A
yeah	3720	A
okay um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and um	3720	B
uh my husband let's see he coaches basketball with Brian um so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side	3720	B
um he's a real sports kind of person so he plays tennis with with the kids we all kind of play tennis as a family except the baby plays on the play ground we take turns with her um	3720	B
uh let's see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer um	3720	B
uh let's see what else we do oh i suppose we watch a little TV together we really don't watch i think as much TV as a lot of people we don't have HBO we do get the Disney channel for the kids	3720	B
uh my kids have the Nintendo which they play and my husband sometimes joins them_1 with that	3720	B
uh my little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things and i'll take some time and do that with her	3720	B
and of course we always read a bed time story at night and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story um	3720	B
basically the story person because_1 my husband doesn't have he gets home from work late or whatever and and usually once in a while he'll read the story to the little one but that's basically my job um	3720	B
it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it and that's kind of cutting into your your time	3720	B
and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine they go upstairs at nine	3720	B
and um now this weekend we'll have a baby sitter come and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late maybe- maybe Brian will still be up and	3720	B
spend some time with him but it is it's really hard you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think	3720	B
uh no i don't work i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities that was two days a week and even just those two days	3720	B
just seemed like it was a lot i don't know how i admire people that that can do it all but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard	3720	B
um even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything and that's another thing i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend and	3720	B
that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son and and they'll be my helper and then they'll get to pick out some of the favorite snacks that they get to pick out so try to do things like that but it you know it's it's uh	3720	B
and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too you fit it in with all that the that	3720	B
i i think a lot of people a lot of people sit sit their kids in front of the TV and HBO and rent movies and and	3720	B
kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know it's very very easy to fall into that trap and i'm not um totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape but um	3720	B
um i think different parts of the country i think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids people are real	3720	B
sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and you know but um	3720	B
what um-hum	3720	B
um-hum and it's it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to to cut back to one and um um	3720	B
but you know if you have the type of job i have a friend that's a nurse and she can pick her hours and that's a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to uh	3720	B
spend time with the children and uh and your husband and	3720	B
do everything at once	3720	B
well i think it's a big it's a big um responsibility you just don't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single	3720	B
when you have children you have to say now this is different and you do have to give things up i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um	3720	B
for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it because they	3720	B
yeah as far as i'm concerned and	3784	B
probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching uh Reasonable Doubts which had a you know capital case in it	3784	B
and uh my- i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony	3784	B
mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day	3784	B
um-hum	3784	B
well	3784	B
i- i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation	3784	B
but i do know that some people	3784	B
almost all people usually die before that point	3784	B
they just get too old	3784	B
um	3784	B
as far as capital punishment on on it's own merits	3784	B
i have the trouble with the way it's applied	3784	B
i think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner	3784	B
uh and i've i've said this very often and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent	3784	B
because if you're if you're black and you kill a white guy you're going to fry period they will kill you	3784	B
if you're black and you kill a black guy you know it's you know two hundred hours of community service	3784	B
yeah	3784	B
well it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship	3784	B
you know we're the majority so we can do whatever the hell we wanna do	3784	B
and you're the minority and you're stuck with it	3784	B
but uh	3784	B
you know we had this in the Vietnam war you know we had you know population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent	3784	B
but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent	3784	B
the handwriting's on the wall there isn't it	3784	B
you know	3784	B
but that's another issue altogether	3784	B
as- as far as capital punishment	3784	B
i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days	3784	B
and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence	3784	B
well that- that goes back to when uh America was a a colony of England	3784	B
in England you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent	3784	B
and	3784	B
once they found you guilty you know the judge said he's guilty kill him	3784	B
well there- there were some people that uh had a problem with that	3784	B
because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me	3784	B
and uh or he'll have somebody lie for him you know people lie it's a strange thing but they do that	3784	B
and	3784	B
to prevent that kind of misuse of power	3784	B
they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap	3784	B
and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy uh at E Systems	3784	B
they were going- to- they convicted him	3784	B
of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit	3784	B
he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of a	3784	B
an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people	3784	B
you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy	3784	B
you know they all look the same to me you know	3784	B
big lips flat nose yep that was him	3784	B
uh-huh	3784	A
i do too	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
why is it you know i- i'm i'm in that same i think if it's uh	3784	A
if it's a convicted- if it's a convicted uh felon on parole	3784	A
uh and he goes out and and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i- i feel the same way i don't think i think that person is is beyond uh	3784	A
rehabilitation and and he should be	3784	A
taken out	3784	A
uh-huh	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
uh-huh	3784	A

huh	3784	A
yep it sure is	3784	A
yeah it's	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
see the only thing i don't you know i don't understand i guess i- i don't understand our judicial system uh as it is right now because i	3784	A
you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death	3784	A
how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal	3784	A
and get stays of execution- execution i mean how you know is there	3784	A
um-hum	3784	A
uh-huh	3784	A

yeah i- i- i rather enjoy the Cosby Show my wife and i both like Commish	3777	A
uh it's either Friday night it's either tonight or tomorrow night um around here at least	3777	A
i guess it depends on what channel you're getting you know what system you're getting it through	3777	A
uh we we always enjoyed it it it seems to be kind of halfway between um	3777	A
something like All In The Family and uh Hill Street Blues	3777	A
uh it's- it's- it's- it's a good show	3777	A
you tend	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
he- he tenderhearted fellow	3777	A
yeah i- i guess that's what first drew us to him the uh	3777	A
the the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours	3777	A
but uh	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
yeah um	3777	A
yeah um i don't know we uh	3777	A
watch Commish any chance we get	3777	A
um used to be a big fan of Star Trek but that's kind of they- they- it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against um anything	3777	A
spiritual	3777	A
but uh	3777	A
anyway	3777	A
yeah i- i used to be a used to be a real big fan of Star Trek	3777	A
um pretty much yeah i always enjoyed the show anyway	3777	A
and Star Trek's in a set- the uh Star Wars set	3777	A
uh the one of the first Star Wars movie	3777	A
i think i watched it something like nineteen times	3777	A
uh i did at one time anyway	3777	A
oh a pretty big fan of that sort of thing used to used to read a read a lot of science fiction work too	3777	A
but uh	3777	A

that that's that's the best way you- you haven't found out yet or anything have you	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
that's the best way	3777	A
i mean it's like finding out somewhere in July what you're gonna get for Christmas i mean you know it's it's it's not as much fun oh	3777	A
anyway	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
oh i'm about half kid heart anyway	3777	A
i- i	3777	A
well	3777	A
the new cartoons don't seem to be worth much but the uh well a couple of the uh ones Disney's doing aren't too bad but	3777	A
oh yeah	3777	A
yeah	3777	A
the the the worst of the violence in the Flintstones was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot	3777	A
but oh shoot i mean blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet or or or you know or on all the you know everything of this species you know just all kinds of crud	3777	A
yeah everything's mutations and and and killing and	3777	A
gone are the days of those things they use what was it i uh uh TNT- uh Turner Broadcasting Network used to	3777	A
used to uh do the Saturday morning and Sunday morning cartoons the old cartoons they used to put between the first and second feature at the theatre	3777	A
those old little ten minute jobs where the uh the real ballooned looking art work you know and- and	3777	A
um i guess one of my favorite ones is Cheers	3777	B
i always liked that one they're always so funny and i also like The Cosby Show those are probably my two favorites	3777	B
you know i've watched that one time and it was really good but now that's on what Saturday night	3777	B
is it Saturday	3777	B
uh-huh i can't i can't remember	3777	B
uh-huh yeah i yeah i saw it one time and i really liked it but i just haven't uh seen it you know watched it since	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
yeah the episode that i watched um	3777	B
i liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason	3777	B
and he seems to do that sometimes	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
yeah i thought it was a pretty good show	3777	B
i also like i- i like to watch like Sixty Minutes and Twenty Twenty	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
i've never gotten into the Star Trek era	3777	B
used to be a Trekkie huh	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
oh my goodness you must have some of the lines memorized	3777	B
wow	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
twelve week oh i was gonna say i hear a baby in the background	3777	B
i imagine that keeps you busy	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
well we're we're expecting our first in about three months so i know we won't be watching as much as we do now	3777	B
oh wow	3777	B
that must be tough	3777	B
it doesn't matter just a healthy baby	3777	B
well we had a sonogram but we told him not to tell us so it's gonna be a surprise	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
yeah it's- it's not quite the same	3777	B
yeah i agree i'm sure we'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows	3777	B
oh i am too i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while when my sister comes to visit so	3777	B
well you know it seems like a lot of them_1 are a lot more violent than they used to be	3777	B
you know i remember like the Flintstones and the Jetsons and those were just kind of good old cartoons	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
yep	3777	B
yeah and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays	3777	B
yeah	3777	B
um-hum	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
uh-huh	3777	B
okay have you painted something lately	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
oh yeah another bedroom	3756	A
hm yeah yeah yeah	3756	A
you know where you get around the edge	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
well how do you get the edge though the the straight edge oh i see	3756	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3756	A
huh	3756	A
well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too	3756	A
oh really	3756	A
oh oh nice	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
oh that'd be nice	3756	A
hm or two tone or two tone	3756	A
you know	3756	A
uh-huh well the white but i have a problem i can't get up high and we can't paint the chimney	3756	A
well we have one of those ladders we're just not willing to get up that high	3756	A
well we did too we did it in the fall and it's just it's too high it's really scary but	3756	A
and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that but is other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
the blowers	3756	A
oh oh oh oh i know what you're talking about um scaffolds that's it	3756	A
huh	3756	A
it's	3756	A
yeah	3756	A
oh my so that was worth it getting a professional for that	3756	A
oh i think that's what we might have to do with the chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself	3756	A
it wasn't too bad i mean you save	3756	A
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty	3756	A
you know since it's a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it but in in in that way you know you're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it	3756	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
my word	3756	A
um-hum	3756	A
um-hum	3756	A
oh my word	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
uh-huh	3756	A
oh my word so that was really worth it painting his own house	3756	A
but uh i think i'll probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little	3756	A
oh i know but it's that it's the textured wall	3756	A
he can still	3756	A
yes i have that room i showed you and then since then we painted the bedroom	3756	B
yeah i showed you that one too didn't i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
oh yeah	3756	B
well i've heard now i asked Janice somebody recently about how- how you do that	3756	B
oh uh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that they'd have special rollers	3756	B
that are real soft and furry that you'd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful	3756	B
we use a a two inch brush with uh on a slant	3756	B
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes	3756	B
but	3756	B
well yeah i think i'm going to do it this spring actually	3756	B
there're there're six houses see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials there's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses	3756	B
so i'm thinking i'm gonna change it to something you know the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones i think i'm gonna put something like a brown on it	3756	B
on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something something- where it'll stand out a little	3756	B
what color'd you paint	3756	B
what- yeah	3756	B
there's some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house	3756	B
on the outside-	3756	B
well you got to get one of those ladders	3756	B
oh yeah well a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he's done his house and that's what he i was out there last weekend he's finished everything except the chimney	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
yeah yeah i know our house in New Mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it	3756	B
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff	3756	B
so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid and he came with with his own rafter- uh what do you call those things no those where you built like a rafter thing	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
scaffolds yeah he came and did it that way and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up	3756	B
and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactuses and if he fell he was dead and he knew that so	3756	B
yeah plus he cleaned up my mess	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
yeah that	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to oh Furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons	3756	B
and anyway he when he checked out they only- and and he was using his Furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something	3756	B
and he had he had the bill- he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint	3756	B
so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something	3756	B
and he saw it- i guess yeah it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff	3756	B
yeah	3756	B
uh	3756	B
yeah rollers are so messy we never mess with them anymore	3756	B
well still a paintbrush	3756	B
uh what do you	3717	A
well i don't know i would hate i would rather not have to have it all taken out but i kind of feel like	3717	A
it's part of living in a free country but it seems like they take quite a bit out	3717	A
oh yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
you probably know like i say you're a lot more knowledgeable about it than i am but do you do for corporations or mainly	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
oh do you oh	3717	A
so what what do they think the corporation you work with	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah well i tell you i- i work for a credit union so that might be a whole another topic as far as well you know how do	3717	A
what's the opinion around there about uh you know credit unions not being taxed and stuff do they do have you guys had any i don't want to say battles but	3717	A
do they uh a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff they they claim the unfair- unfair- uh unfair playing field and whatnot and	3717	A
whether or not credit unions are getting you know being treated special and do they get	3717	A
oh yeah	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
it's where they're going to tax credit unions on a state level or or just assess their more for the insurance fund	3717	A
huh yeah it's uh i don't know i want i think i've always felt that if we credit unions stick to their little niche they have that then it probably shouldn't be but it seems like more and more uh	3717	A
we're getting out into a lot of the bank territories i do not know if it is too fair or not	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
oh yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
but	3717	A
yeah they getting into business lending and things like that or yeah i the credit union i work for is one of the top the twenty- uh about the fifteenth largest and we are starting to get into that and that is where i really have my questions as to whether or not we're	3717	A
you know if they were able were playing on a level field whereas the banks are getting taxed and stuff	3717	A
and i don't know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed there's no doubt about it	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean we've talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or	3717	A
yeah that's true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but	3717	A
maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
yeah that's more or less touchy-feely thing as opposed to	3717	A
yeah i just always heard that the poor would end- end up taking the worst brunt of it because they're	3717	A
you know their their income is less and yet they're being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know i've heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that it'll be maybe a different level of tax but	3717	A
seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldn't do much anyway	3717	A
um-hum	3717	A
yeah that's true	3717	A
yeah that's true	3717	A
yeah	3717	A
uh-huh	3717	A
well uh	3717	A
are the taxes in in Texas are they are few state taxes very high or	3717	A
oh don't you oh that's sweet	3717	A
oh that hurts	3717	A
yeah it is	3717	A
how do you feel about it	3717	B
uh i'm a tax lawyer and uh i uh	3717	B
but i agree with you i uh	3717	B
i-	3717	B
um-hum	3717	B
yeah corporations i work for a bank	3717	B
yeah and uh	3717	B
and	3717	B
um	3717	B
well banks banks are regulated of course by the uh by the federal government anyway so	3717	B
we don't have the franchise taxes	3717	B
which are	3717	B
are not federal taxes uh	3717	B
i don't know i- i think they i don't hear anything at work about them really	3717	B
oh okay	3717	B
we've had that too because of the failures though	3717	B
and uh whether or not they should be assessed more	3717	B
and uh the the state has uh has uh is in the midst of a reform probably in that area	3717	B
or or higher assessment to yeah	3717	B
right	3717	B
uh i don't know that it is fair i think that it's you know the way banking is being uh compacted i work for at Nations Bank which has just merged with C and S Sovran	3717	B
and uh	3717	B
you know i think i think a little competition is good	3717	B
uh	3717	B
but down here a lot we saw we say them_1 doing things they shouldn't be doing	3717	B
yeah real estate	3717	B
yeah	3717	B
everybody's gone down i think the individual levels are fine	3717	B
uh i don't think they're perceived as uh	3717	B
was i learned in school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a hundred thousand dollars you know	3717	B
uh we wouldn't reduce the deficit by	3717	B
but but a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that	3717	B
well that's what sales tax are	3717	B
that uh flat taxes i think are a pretty good idea uh they're debating of course right now whether to bring in capital gains again uh to stimulate the economy	3717	B
and uh find from what i from what i recall it doesn't stimulate the economy that much it just uh boots everybody's feeling about stimulating the economy	3717	B
yeah	3717	B
the	3717	B
i- i what happens is i think it is a good idea but they chip away at it i mean the home mortgage deduction is like sacrosanct	3717	B
you can't take away people that said there you go you've got one exception already and uh and uh it you know well if we didn't have this exception then we'll just add this one and it just gets it snowballs	3717	B
i- i think it is in theory probably a good idea	3717	B
we don't have state income tax	3717	B
none	3717	B
but we've got an eight percent state sales tax	3717	B
yeah and uh you know course that's	3717	B
that's a regressive tax	3717	B
and it's you know uh	3717	B
uh it's not on grocery	3717	B
well today it's uh we're not doing much with it because_1 it's kind of raining outside but or snowing actually uh	3787	B
but um actually my husband is in the other room um planning a um organic garden or organic treatment um	3787	B
yeah do you do a lot of lawn work	3787	B
um-hum	3787	B
well there was a time when my husband had had- had traveled a lot and um	3787	B
we haven't been treating it as well you know using fertilizer and stuff or i guess the lawn looks okay it's just that we don't we still have a problem with weeds	3787	B
and	3787	B
but the thing that he is wanting to try this year is um using some organic treatments and	3787	B
we're not real naturalists or anything but um	3787	B
um but uh um so he wants to try doing some you know different kind of stuff i don't really know what it involves or um um	3787	B
at this point in time i enjoyed having the service when we did um	3787	B
what service did you use	3787	B
Lawn Doctor	3787	B
hm	3787	B
yeah we tried using Chem Lawn but um our problem is our front yard is completely different from the backyard	3787	B
and um i think they just use the same stuff on everything because_1 we've got a mixture our front yard is um all Bermuda what's not weeds	3787	B
and the backyard is a mixture of Saint Augustine Bermuda and some type of uh winter grass that stays green all all winter	3787	B
yeah something like that it's real clumpy and	3787	B
yeah	3787	B
oh do you do you ever- do you ever double sod or um whatever-	3787	B
you know where they mix the seed	3787	B
yeah yeah i think that's our problem is that we we just need to get it fertilized really good so that we can get the grass- grass growing rather than the weeds	3787	B
um in the front yard not so much we have a lot-	3787	B
so how's your lawn and garden work	3787	A
yeah i understand that it actually is snowing cold and wet	3787	A
oh is he okay_1	3787	A
not so much anymore i'm i'm getting older i'm fifty two now so i've just uh i've sort of slowed down you know we use this rather than do it ourselves as far as fertilizing i utilize a service and i guess they do a an okay type of job	3787	A
but uh and i've let this little kid that lives behind us cut our grass just a little bit this past year i think i'm gonna let him do it all this year just	3787	A
i work uh i'm out of town quite a bit and i come home and seems like every Friday that's what i have to face on Saturday is doing my lawn so i just stopped doing that	3787	A
right	3787	A
oh i understand yeah we- yeah we have a problem about_1 every other year with weeds it it appears that every other year a service can get rid of them and uh but just- just about every other year they come back	3787	A
it's a constant battle i tell you	3787	A
right	3787	A
i understand	3787	A
i do too so i'm have the same problem	3787	A
right	3787	A
right	3787	A
right	3787	A
with a thirty five dollar bill well- well we didn't use one year before last a service because we we had weeds like two years in a row and you know when you when you have a service you don't expect that so	3787	A
we stopped and i sort of did it myself year before last then this last summer i'd went back to a service and then went but went to a new service and they appear to have be doing a better job	3787	A
Lawn Doctor	3787	A
and we used to use one in Plano and we switched to one that's more local	3787	A
one of our friends bought the one in Plano they just didn't uh didn't do that good a job on our lawn so we changed services	3787	A
right	3787	A
right	3787	A
right either rye or something	3787	A
yeah you can see i have we have a lot of trees in our yard so it's a it's you know during the summer it's bare under the trees so i've planted a lot- planted a lot of rye- winter rye to grow because that will grow in the summertime under trees	3787	A
it's more of a shade- it's a better shade grass so now as as cold as it is out there and as rainy as it is we have you can see where we planted all the green grass but as it's in the summer because_1 that's- that's the only green area in our lawn	3787	A
all of our Bermuda's all brown	3787	A
we have on the side yard few years back right	3787	A
i'm always uh you know sometimes i'm sometimes i'm i'm over at Home Depot i'll just a grab a grass- a thing of of grass seed and put it in the old	3787	A
spreader and just spread it real quick or throw it out in the areas where i think i need it but overall i guess we have a pretty good stand of grass they say in the summertime the hotter it is the better the Bermuda grows and course that supposedly quote will crowd out the weeds and everything so	3787	A
so i just	3787	A
right how about_1 how about_1 flowers you have you have nice flowers in your front yard	3787	A
what are you cooking for supper	3857	A
that sounds pretty good	3857	A
what type of food	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
well i'm kind of a house husband and and i cook everyday	3857	A
it's about the only thing that	3857	A
huh	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
and	3857	A
today i made a banana cream pie my wife gets testy if i don't have some sort of dessert in the house	3857	A
yeah sometimes i i make things and they don't work so i kind of throw them_1 away before anybody sees them_1	3857	A
but i'm a i i don't know i live out of cookbooks other than stuff that i've cooked over and over and over	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
sometimes i like to get a hold of a very hard book uh	3857	A
and hard recipes especially some of the French dishes	3857	A
and where i've got to read it reread it and then keep it out while i'm cooking	3857	A
and you know something new not something i'm going to fix every day or something	3857	A
right	3857	A
but i guess i know for like twenty years i my wife and i both been fixing a a chicken dish from the Philippines and	3857	A
it's really really strong with garlic and black pepper and	3857	A
we've always thought nobody would like it	3857	A
and uh	3857	A
we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe	3857	A
yeah and i didn't go easy on anything	3857	A
yeah it's it's delicious it's like when it when it's like birthday time and you say well what do you want to eat we always say Chicken Adobo and	3857	A
it's just it's very pungent thing and and we just didn't think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and i've already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so	3857	A
maybe	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
where did you grow up in the Midwest	3857	A
okay	3857	A
right	3857	A
uh	3857	A
i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks they're they're from Midwest from Iowa from her background	3857	A
because that's where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area	3857	A
so it's especially when we're baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know they've been tried and tested and and everything so	3857	A
yeah uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and	3857	A
uh no we lived up at Los Alamos	3857	A
so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh	3857	A
Santa Fe type dishes and uh	3857	A
that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they uh they expect it	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
we don't even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants around here	3857	A
yeah well	3857	A
in this part of the world there's you know there's a lot and there's some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so	3857	A
you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe	3857	A
that i'd rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and	3857	A
yeah	3857	A
oh boy that's a good question i haven't figured that one out yet	3857	B
personally i'm thinking of making a goulash	3857	B
but i'm publishing a cookbook right now so or getting it ready to go to the publisher	3857	B
all types	3857	B
different nationalities there's going to be a different section for each nationality	3857	B
it ranges anywhere from Midwestern cooking to Japanese	3857	B
there's some Scottish- there's some Scottish in it some Scottish dishes that i know some Russian some for babies you know how to make baby food instead of buying it because it's so bloody expensive	3857	B
i'm a housewife	3857	B
i'm a housewife	3857	B
everyday too	3857	B
i've got two little boys	3857	B
yeah i made banana bread two days ago and it's gone	3857	B
everything i make disappears real quick so i guess people like it	3857	B
yeah well see a lot of people do live by cookbooks not just house husbands but like bachelors and stuff they don't know how to cook anything you know unless they have a recipe to follow	3857	B
that's why i'm publishing this cookbook because it's simple recipes	3857	B
it's nothing that's hard	3857	B
it's just everything in it is really simple	3857	B
you are	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
just something for a special occasion	3857	B
oh really	3857	B
that must have made you feel good	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
huh	3857	B
well my husband went to chef school before we got married and he can cook all kinds of fancy dishes and i can because i went to cooking school too but i	3857	B
i favor the Midwestern kind of cooking because i grew up country so that's what i like to	3857	B
well i grew up in Arizona	3857	B
on a ranch- on a ranch and it was a horse ranch and we cooked country style you know i mean you don't peel your potatoes when you cook them in the country you just cut them up and there you go	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
yep	3857	B
well my mom published a cookbook when she was married to my dad which was about ten years ago	3857	B
but um	3857	B
and she published hers so now it's my turn	3857	B
i'm trying my luck	3857	B
anywhere near Alamogordo	3857	B
oh	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
there's some really good food that comes out of there i'll tell you	3857	B
there is none around here that's really Mexican	3857	B
they're all fake	3857	B
you know and when you taste the food you know it	3857	B
there's just a difference	3857	B
oh really	3857	B
yeah	3857	B
well i live in San Diego and it's right near the border	3857	B
but you'd be surprised how fake the restaurants are out here they	3857	B
knowing how close we are to the border i mean you only have to drive five minutes to get to the border	3857	B
you'd think that there'd be good Mexican cooking here	3857	B
the last family reunion i did not plan i only participated and enjoyed about two years ago	3817	B
how about_1 you	3817	B
it often depends how far you want to go back on- on our particular family reunion they went back to my great-great-grandfather	3817	B
so that it was quite um spread out and there were many families um and there were many people we didn't know i think the total participation i don't know how many were invited but there were about two hundred and fifty people there	3817	B
and some of the families one of the cutest things that some of the the families- families did was to get T-shirts that identified themselves as that branch of the family	3817	B
it was fun	3817	B
actually he was not he has gone but they decided to go ahead and take the family reunion back that far so that it wouldn't just be people meeting third cousins but people meeting i guess	3817	B
whatever fifth and seventh cousins	3817	B
and the other thing that i thought was particularly fun was uh the huge they had a huge family tree uh that was posted so you could sort of everybody could sort of see who married whom and	3817	B
so that was fun	3817	B
you know in every family there's usually one person that is gifted to do these things i have a cousin who never marries who is a librarian sounds like a bad novel	3817	B
um and she did she was she's always been interested in genealogy and she's kind of kept track and so	3817	B
um i think she just started out writing to	3817	B
key people in the different branches of families and asking them to contact everyone and i really on the family tree there really was everyone except there was just some one group that had sort of gotten lost	3817	B
in Missouri but this is was in Indiana and it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in one area	3817	B
so it wasn't like they were necessarily from all over the country but	3817	B
we're a good Catholic German stock and so yes	3817	B
the original family that i eluded to my great-grandfather had twelve children and they had some pictures of that- that was another thing they did that i thought was fun	3817	B
sounds like the twelve tribes of Israel or something	3817	B
that's always true they remember most the games they had lots of games and competitions which were fun well are you planning a family reunion	3817	B
oh	3817	B
do you how your relatives- you're from San you're in San Francisco	3817	B
sometimes when you've moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be	3817	B
this is a little office	3817	B
that sounds	3817	B
typical	3817	B
i never knew that i- i always i thought the children- like the children of your first cousins i always called those second cousins and my children and my cousins' children i called third cousins	3817	B
that's how i've always named it some people have this once removed stuff and i don't know what that means	3817	B
they'd just be your great-aunts great-aunt your grandparents' siblings would be your great aunts and uncles	3817	B
and	3817	B
so but it it is interesting sometimes a little sad when families branch out quite so much but i don't know that's the American way	3817	B
i had two distant relatives who lived in the Dallas Fort Worth area that- that i never had met and didn't know they were here and we we all laughed how it was funny to go back to Indiana to meet people who lived	3817	B
ten miles from you so that was sort of funny in fact one of them it's like my father-	3817	B
i don't remember how this was i guess it was actually just my father's cousin so it's not all that far away turns out he even goes to our church here in Dallas so	3817	B
planned a family reunion recently	3817	A
you know i really haven't and i know of friends who've done it recently and have really enjoyed um	3817	A
the the planning process but uh most of our family see each other fairly frequently so it's it's uh you know not a a major event to to try and plan it because we're all fairly close um	3817	A
that's wonderful	3817	A
oh that's great	3817	A
so your great-grandfather was still living and everyone up to that point was invited	3817	A
uh-huh wow	3817	A
uh-huh	3817	A
that's wonderful two hundred people who organized it who was the one that instigated the the planning process	3817	A
i was gonna ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was	3817	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3817	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3817	A
now given the size of the group were there people were most of the families fairly large is that what contributed to that	3817	A
that's great	3817	A
that's wonderful i'm sure that was a wonderful experience for the kids too and even if they didn't appreciate it at the moment they'll probably really appreciate it later	3817	A
no uh uh	3817	A
yeah my folks uh moved from Michigan to San Diego and that's where they raised the three of us my daughter my sisters and myself	3817	A
but uh	3817	A
i would expect yeah yeah	3817	A
and i know that my grandparents' families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother	3817	A
so we've kept in touch those first cousins very pretty closely um i'm not quite sure how i'd even pursue finding the rest of the folks in Michigan	3817	A
i think i think each of my grandparents had ten siblings	3817	A
so	3817	A
there's got to be a few of those second does that make second cousin or third cousin i'm not sure	3817	A
oh okay okay	3817	A
so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great	3817	A
aunts and uncles	3817	A
right right	3817	A
did you find that you had a lot in common did people find out things about each other that they hadn't been aware	3817	A
really	3817	A
uh-huh	3817	A
do you um have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting	3813	A
um-hum	3813	A
yeah	3813	A
oh well we don't have a real strict budget um	3813	A
we have a a low budget to work on but we um you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we- we just spend about so much we don't	3813	A
i- i don't know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there	3813	A
a certain amount	3813	A
yeah	3813	A
oh	3813	A
wow that's great	3813	A
oh	3813	A
oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient	3813	A
hm	3813	A
yeah well that's a good idea	3813	A
let's see the the other thing there the topic was talking about was	3813	A
if you if i don't all i can think of is if you don't keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses but um	3813	A
one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas well not fly back but somehow we get back there	3813	A
and um this year we did it by train because_1 it was the least expensive and	3813	A
huh oh yeah	3813	A
and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare	3813	A
and so um	3813	A
we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and	3813	A
entertainment things like that then um	3813	A
somewhere in out in the wash it'll come out that we have enough to get back there you know	3813	A
uh-huh that's right	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
uh-huh that's right	3813	A
yeah well whenever i don't know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will i'll probably pick it up	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
yeah i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in count it up at the end of the year something	3813	A
but yeah	3813	A
uh-huh	3813	A
well for many many years uh	3813	B
my wife and i did have a budget uh we were both working at the time and so forth	3813	B
and um	3813	B
that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of	3813	B
uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation	3813	B
so it it's uh it's been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of	3813	B
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did	3813	B
sure uh-huh	3813	B
um-hum	3813	B
i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh	3813	B
you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i- i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there	3813	B
as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that	3813	B
yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff	3813	B
and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal- personal storage	3813	B
well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall when- if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up	3813	B
so it's it's worked very well that way at least that way we you know if each of us finds something is missing	3813	B
uh we put it up uh the other person might not know about it	3813	B
that way we can keep up to date	3813	B
uh-huh	3813	B
well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
sure well i think we unconsciously do the same thing excuse me my throat's not as clear today as it should be	3813	B
uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks	3813	B
tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money	3813	B
so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip	3813	B
so that- that is another way of uh budgeting	3813	B
and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we don't throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice	3813	B
i do the same thing i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
yeah	3813	B
well let's face it then when we talking budget	3813	B
it is important to to have a budget and uh i- i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the	3813	B
level of my checking- checking account and i have a money market account also	3813	B
and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum	3813	B
and i'm always trying to	3813	B
hello	3862	A
hi my name is Dolphene i live in Texas	3862	A
okay i work for TI do do you also okay	3862	A
oh okay uh you're ready to begin	3862	A
oh okay	3862	A
okay	3862	A
yes	3862	A
well i don't think that uh any of my relatives would really like to go there	3862	A
i- i believe that if i am in a position uh like when my mother	3862	A
gets to the- to a point where she needs special care that i'll be able to	3862	A
just bring her into my home	3862	A
and my father also and um	3862	A
or have someone go into their home you know and um and look after them	3862	A
that way	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
you right it's it's basically it's more how they feel about it because_1 it's like they have feel they feel like they're they're um	3862	A
my- the way my mother would put it like somebody had {throwed} them_1 away you know	3862	A
right	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
um-hum	3862	A
um-hum and another- another thing to think about um on the positive side of the nursing homes there	3862	A
i used to work uh in one of the offices in a nursing home and i got to see a lot of the things that that they did	3862	A
they um they had a lot of crafts	3862	A
and they had a lot of games	3862	A
and uh they get together and they just do they they do all sorts of things and then there's some of- some of the uh	3862	A
the people that are that are in there	3862	A
are real nice- you know very very nice and friendly to everybody	3862	A
and uh then there are others that are it's a just just a job and they just you know wanna go in and do what they have to do and get out and go home um	3862	A
the the attitude of the staff as you said is- is is really uh very very important	3862	A
right	3862	A
right	3862	A
yeah	3862	A
um yeah	3862	A
well it's like well- the one that i worked in um you would see some of them_1 uh just	3862	A
like in wheelchairs all day they'd just roll- roll themselves around all over the place and	3862	A
and they would enjoy themselves with activities and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group and they they just	3862	A
didn't like participate together with the others because they they had some some uh	3862	A
i guess slight- a slight mental disabilities and things like um what what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that they just don't don't um	3862	A
they weren't really together with the rest of them_1 when they got together for such activities	3862	A
hello	3862	B
hi my name is Pat Johnson and i live in Texas too	3862	B
no	3862	B
no i live in Dallas i work for the Dallas school system	3862	B
we might as well	3862	B
understand we're doing care of the elderly right	3862	B
and how do you feel about putting someone in a nursing home	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yes i would find it very difficult uh to place	3862	B
either- my father or my stepmother	3862	B
ah in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it	3862	B
yes	3862	B
yes i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you're faced with placing someone	3862	B
um in a place like that uh you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that's offered and such but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference	3862	B
and i have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and- have no family who could care- you know care for her	3862	B
and uh i know that uh the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about uh her situation	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yes	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yeah	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
i think it would matter too uh the kinds of uh	3862	B
disabilities	3862	B
that	3862	B
the nursing home accepts	3862	B
because there are some uh	3862	B
who poor things you know don't have uh any real grasp on reality any longer	3862	B
and they may be ambulatory but they tend to behave like children small children	3862	B
and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to have- to have to deal with on a daily basis	3862	B
ooh	3862	B
um-hum	3862	B
yes	3862	B
um-hum um-hum	3862	B
yes	3862	B
yeah Alzheimer's yes	3862	B
yes and that can	3862	B
uh well yeah i am as a matter of fact well actually- actually i'm looking for another car but uh uh new probably not	3815	B
uh sports car uh usually either black or red	3815	B
and- and electric windows and power locks no	3815	B
well uh not so much that as it is i've had so many times when uh uh you know i- i'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody	3815	B
uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window	3815	B
it is just a real pain or you know if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them_1 it's real difficult to drive reach- reach over and try to roll down the window	3815	B
and uh so power locks and power windows are just just things that uh uh just really help a lot what about you	3815	B
oh	3815	B
sure	3815	B
have you ever had a car with an air bag	3815	B
no	3815	B
well it it seems- sure seems to save lives and uh yeah i actually i like the antilock brakes	3815	B
and i've never had a chance to i have been in cars that have had them but i've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up	3815	B
but uh you think you'd buy uh an American car or a European or Japanese	3815	B
what was that	3815	B
huh stick shift huh did it have what a three speed or a four speed	3815	B
wow	3815	B
well actually i much prefer a stick shift	3815	B
and what i'm i'm curious i- i know why i love a stick shift why do you why did you want one	3815	B
um-hum	3815	B
it's hard to find stick shift cars anymore	3815	B
huh	3815	B
yeah no i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift	3815	B
huh	3815	B
huh	3815	B
um i guess i- i grew up on it and it's fun it's it's an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control	3815	B
over the car and it- it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and ice and slick conditions	3815	B
uh it- it- it does uh i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun	3815	B
yeah yeah	3815	B
well are you in the market for a new car	3815	A
oh what sort of requirements to you have for your car	3815	A
uh-huh	3815	A
um	3815	A
i see	3815	A
top of top of the line	3815	A
oh	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
right right	3815	A
um-hum um-hum	3815	A
well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like power- power windows or power locks because the people that i know have- who have them_1 always seem to have trouble with them	3815	A
and um so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and	3815	A
uh i guess a good	3815	A
no i haven't have you	3815	A
somehow i just think you know i like the idea	3815	A
right	3815	A
right that's a good idea	3815	A
um-hum um-hum	3815	A
well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i- i guess i did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record	3815	A
good mileage um	3815	A
and i needed air-conditioning and um	3815	A
can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift	3815	A
and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that	3815	A
you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a Chrysler um	3815	A
Lancer	3815	A
yeah	3815	A
no a five speed and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it	3815	A
so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move	3815	A
well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable	3815	A
um	3815	A
i found that out i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement	3815	A
so	3815	A
yeah	3815	A
well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports cars but now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift	3815	A
and so why do you like stick shift	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
right right	3815	A
um-hum	3815	A
right and actually it's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active	3815	A
so	3815	A
so	3833	A
um i did until my company went bankrupt	3833	A
yeah now right now i haven't been able to locate a job down here in Patterson	3833	A
it's kind of a small	3833	A
city so	3833	A
i've been going to Modesto which is larger but it's not like being in the Bay area where i came from	3833	A
you know	3833	A
but anyhow when i did work in the winter time i wore uh my wool skirts and sweaters and boots	3833	A
because the Bay area gets kind of chilly in the winter time	3833	A
and um then in the summer time i just wore you know the polyester blouses and usually- usually pants and just uh heels you know	3833	A
so uh where do you work at	3833	A
oh okay	3833	A
right	3833	A
you do you i don't suppose you can wear pants	3833	A
oh because i never see anybody in the banks out here it seems like i never see them_1 with pants on	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
no no i haven't	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
oh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
oh really	3833	A
isn't that	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
hum	3833	A
yeah that would be interesting to do um i worked for a trucking company so we didn't really even have to dress up at all if we didn't want to we could wear pants all the time you know	3833	A
but uh i just in the winter time i just like to wear boots and you know the wool skirts and the sweaters and everything	3833	A
but uh i've never gone to and had a you know	3833	A
anything like that done to tell me exactly what color i would look best in	3833	A
uh i know i don't look good in yellow but i like pink and blue you know and red	3833	A
but uh i just look in the mirror and	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
um-hum um-hum	3833	A
uh-huh huh very interesting	3833	A
so do you have your do you like like do you in Dallas do you wear wool in the winter time or	3833	A
uh-huh	3833	A
um-hum	3833	A
um	3833	A
um-hum and naturally it gets real hot in the summertime i suppose yeah	3833	A
yeah yeah it gets hot here in Patterson in the summer time more so than it did in the Bay area you know um like here	3833	A
uh like um a hundred and twenty six miles from Fresno	3833	A
but in the valley north	3833	A
right	3833	A
right uh-huh	3833	A
oh i see uh-huh so you have came to California though do you have family-	3833	A
uh do you work outside the home	3833	B
oh poor baby	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
um-hum	3833	B
oh yeah	3833	B
um-hum	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
i work for a bank and uh i have to dress somewhat more formally	3833	B
so i- i look like the little old lady preppie	3833	B
uh no i- i guess i could but i don't	3833	B
no no we don't wear pants uh i- i wear suits	3833	B
uh almost exclusively	3833	B
have you ever had a uh a color analysis	3833	B
uh	3833	B
well it's a very interesting process	3833	B
uh according to the lady that did mine she called them_1 summer and winter	3833	B
and uh spring and fall and the summer she said you could call them A B C D or one two three four or whatever	3833	B
but there are people that look better in the cool colors	3833	B
than than the other people look better in the earth and warm colors	3833	B
and uh most people are summers or winters	3833	B
and uh	3833	B
uh it's really an interesting process and i found out i was a summer so i look much better in the the blues pinks	3833	B
uh	3833	B
the the winters uh wear stronger colors	3833	B
but basically the same types of colors but as a summer i'm not supposed to wear uh black or stark white	3833	B
uh	3833	B
the winters- just winters wear black and white and the summer uh the spring and and fall colors wear well i have a daughter in law that uh	3833	B
uh this the the camouflage colors the khakis and the olive drab green	3833	B
just make her eyes light up like crazy yeah and then i- i also have a daughter in law who has auburn hair	3833	B
so she wears the earth colors uh the oranges and the olive drab greens and the khakis and and uh they're most becoming to her so it it it it really is an interesting	3833	B
analysis	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah	3833	B
uh-huh	3833	B
yeah uh-huh	3833	B
yeah well reds uh i i have to have a red that leans towards the the blue uh in other words it leans toward the maroon	3833	B
but the reds that lead lean toward the orange don't do a thing for me	3833	B
so i have to be careful about reds	3833	B
oh yeah oh yeah uh we have thirty nine- an average of thirty nine days when it gets down below freezing and as a general rule at least oh	3833	B
oh two or three days at a time during the winter we'll either have uh ice covered streets or two or three inches of snow	3833	B
so uh i- i wear woolens quite a bit	3833	B
oh yeah oh yeah it gets very warm in the summertime	3833	B
yeah yeah uh-huh	3833	B
are are you over toward Fresno	3833	B
uh south	3833	B
oh north oh i see i have not been i have not been north of of uh	3833	B
uh what is it uh Interstate Eighty that goes from Sacramento to San Francisco	3833	B
i have not been north of that highway	3833	B
yes uh-huh	3833	B
okay	3852	B
well Larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and and	3852	B
a couple of ladies ran a stop light the lights weren't working properly it wasn't their fault but we they didn't run it we both had green and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car so	3852	B
that was a huge repair bill	3852	B
i know i hated that	3852	B
so it wasn't enough to total it but that's my that's been my most uh	3852	B
expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years and	3852	B
well i travel a lot so you know uh this last one i leased so i don't know and i leased it on a twenty four month program it's the first time i've ever done that but i'll probably go back to buying them_1 because i don't care to lease them_1	3852	B
no it has the expanding balloons	3852	B
uh it they didn't go off	3852	B
no i guess we weren't going that sort of upset me we weren't going fast enough according- when i called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it but no sir didn't go off uh we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day and	3852	B
and the street lights	3852	B
yes	3852	B
yes	3852	B
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything i tell you just	3852	B
took it all off it was uh uh my my doors were okay front and back and	3852	B
but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage it was a expensive- then i get it back and two weeks after that i'm driving it in front of the local high school	3852	B
and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage so	3852	B
so i'm gonna get rid- my twenty four months is up on this car i'm getting rid of this car	3852	B
my golly how about_1 you Larry	3852	B
i understand	3852	B
i understand	3852	B
sure	3852	B
well- i understand that because i'm from West Virginia and we had the same thing up there continuously- continuously salting the roads for snow	3852	B
sure	3852	B
no i'm gonna i'm gonna buy it Larry i don't like the rental i think i'm getting ready to retire myself and i'm going to i'm going to be you know driving a car for longer so i usually drive a car	3852	B
for three years and and anyway and	3852	B
so but last couple cars i've only driven for two years so i'd leased this one for two years so i'll probably go back and buy one and uh this next car -will probably be my retirement car	3852	B
well- no sir not really not really uh	3852	B
no problem at all my wife and daughter we have uh two Toyotas in the family one Nissan and we have the Lincoln and uh the not really no problem there at all as finding- as far as finding parking places it's it's convenient in that in that regard	3852	B
yes it is and i'm and i travel i'm like a traveling salesman don't travel a lot any more but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive	3852	B
yes	3852	B
is that right	3852	B
-well my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old it only has doesn't even have thirty miles- thirty thousand miles on it so gosh been much in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car	3852	B
okay_1 Ron welcome to the net and uh what did you do about your last auto repair oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth	3852	A
um	3852	A
my goodness gracious that's	3852	A
well that's still not enough for a total is it	3852	A
to get it's a very expensive automobile	3852	A
oh and do you buy one every two years	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had	3852	A
did that help you	3852	A
they didn't go off	3852	A
well what-	3852	A
but you were hit in the side weren't you	3852	A
that may be the problem you you might- you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to uh activate it	3852	A
my goodness	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
my goodness	3852	A
i would think so that doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one	3852	A
well i'm relatively fortunate about that uh here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities	3852	A
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they don't have to drive that way here and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle	3852	A
and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time	3852	A
uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh and i drive a Honda most of the time	3852	A
and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
well i just i did- i had this Cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders	3852	A
uh done and then it all repainted and then winter got here and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off so i haven't had a chance to drive it very much	3852	A
but anyhow uh uh now are you gonna buy this next car or you going rent it a lease again	3852	A
are you	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
well that's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the Lincoln uh isn't it too large for normal town driving	3852	A
finding parking places and getting in and out the doors	3852	A
uh-huh	3852	A
ah	3852	A
yeah	3852	A
well- well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips	3852	A
i'm i'm very much aware of that	3852	A
um-hum	3852	A
yes i'm sure it is because that's the way that i enjoy this Pontiac that i have it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine	3852	A
um-hum do you do you feel that uh	3852	A
well um i had planned a very successful cousins reunion i have a lot of cousins and i did that several years ago in fact it was so well received they've been really having a fit for me to do it again	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
good	3897	B
oh how neat	3897	B
uh-huh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over several-	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum well that's kind of nice to be able to do that to- for both occasions my my uh family	3897	B
um my father's family uh he had five or six oh i let see six brothers and sisters	3897	B
and uh when my grandmother died we found that we were not getting together except um just when somebody died	3897	B
it was only funerals and so it was kind of sad so about i guess it was about two or three years ago i planed this cousins reunion and how i my my cousins even though we're all	3897	B
fairly close there's only two or three of them that's out of town and out of state	3897	B
uh i we didn't keep in close contact and there were sometimes well let's see one one family had five and one family had four children and the rest of us were you know like two and three	3897	B
and uh	3897	B
so i just sent to the oldest child in each you know uh in each family	3897	B
uh my oldest cousin in every family to uh to send me their	3897	B
brother's and sister's names and addresses and their names of their spouses	3897	B
and i got good- pretty good response from that had to do a little phone work and then i just sent out a real neat little memo to everybody	3897	B
and one of the cousins helped cook the meat- the meat and everybody brought a dish	3897	B
and uh i it just worked out really really well	3897	B
oh my word	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
well i- i can imagine it's hard to get that many people together	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
oh shoot well how often do you all do you have- try to have like reunion	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum oh well that's that would be fun uh-huh	3897	B
uh-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
well i don't know about you but neighborhoods just aren't like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that that is really neat	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
oh sure and and to find out what happened to everybody right um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
well one of the fun things i did was when i sent out my invitations i mean they weren't like invitations i just did it on a	3897	B
on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my cousins um when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage	3897	B
on on that you know and just just printed it on uh a real good copy machine uh you know you they weren't really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it	3897	B
and everybody got a big kick out of that because_1 there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had had	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
um-hum	3897	B
oh that would be fun- uh was that it wasn't- that wasn't a genealogy book or	3897	B
it was it was different than that	3897	B
go ahead Vickie	3897	A
um-hum	3897	A
i've never actually got to plan one but i've came to several back here in Tennessee that uh were planned long distance with people you know because_1 my immediate family is like five states	3897	A
and they've all turned out pretty good and this time we're here for my mother's eighty fifth birthday	3897	A
and we had a big dinner today about thirty people and	3897	A
uh well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephew's one of my nephew's is getting married so	3897	A
a lot of people came from well to Florida Virginia and Texas and Tennessee here for that for both occasions	3897	A
so it's been	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
i i'm actually one of sixteen kids so and only nine of those kids belong to my mother	3897	A
and they were all here in Tennessee today the first time we have all been together for a snap shot in	3897	A
well forever it's been in my memory yeah	3897	A
the last time we had a legitimate family reunion one of the sisters couldn't make it so	3897	A
everybody had pictures of everybody together but her	3897	A
so today we	3897	A
well	3897	A
it's kind of like your family sometimes it's just funerals and and and special occasions but the last family reunion was in eighty five and i'd like to see another one get going	3897	A
i was going to you know now that the subjects been brought up uh about five years ago it was- actually i didn't get to attend this but i was so wanting to but several of my sisters had got together with some other people in the neighborhood we grew up in	3897	A
and we had a community park and of course we all rode the same buses and stuff and they had a block- or like a community reunion and	3897	A
i didn't get to attend because i was in the process of moving to Texas over that same weekend and uh but they said you know it was a blast and they sent me pictures	3897	A
it was you know people we grew up with and uh people came from all over the place to get back for that one	3897	A
yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but uh i'd like to see i'd still like to see them_1 yeah	3897	A
well at the time you know all i could do was tell them hey well Sam's moving from New Mexico to Texas and this that and so- the other so	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
yeah	3897	A
um-hum	3897	A
hum a few years ago my wife's family and they're off in a little town in Missouri and uh	3897	A
they planned it for several years and actually had a book made of peoples stories and where people went and photographs that went back about two hundred years and uh and of course	3897	A
it was no it each each family that lived in	3897	A
what what you have some ideas on the to help out the President here	3881	A
right i- i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at	3881	A
right people get get where they depend on the the benefit and they don't have much interest and there is no uh	3881	A
uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesn't get continued there's there's a lot of waste as a result i think of that	3881	A
yeah	3881	A
yeah	3881	A
well uh i	3881	A
yeah i think there's uh there's a good opportunity if they'll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh	3881	A
if and combine the savings there with with the savings in	3881	A
all these uh give away programs and and then waste that's in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just	3881	A
continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that don't do any good	3881	A
well there was a there was a study i don't know if you heard of it it was the Grace Commission	3881	A
uh and it it he was uh a private uh individual and he did a study on on cutting waste out of government and he came up with	3881	A
i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on	3881	A
uh-huh	3881	A
right yeah you wonder if all that is necessary and that's the same in government i guess it's is it all necessary	3881	A
yeah yeah it it perpetuates a lot more jobs i think is what it does	3881	A
but but	3881	A
uh-huh	3881	A
yeah well	3881	A
well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and that's something the government has never really tried hard to do uh	3881	A
they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have	3881	A
uh there's no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when you're going into debt to do it	3881	A
uh	3881	B
i think that uh one of the things they're going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at what's important and what has a return on investment	3881	B
uh there's an awful lot of federal programs that uh	3881	B
they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good	3881	B
and there's some things some programs that just don't seem to be working at all	3881	B
uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs they're just seem to be self perpetuating	3881	B
and uh	3881	B
uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved	3881	B
just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them_1 no incentive whatever to to solve their own problems	3881	B
well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh	3881	B
they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family	3881	B
so that's resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare	3881	B
and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around	3881	B
and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing	3881	B
i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation	3881	B
I know that	3881	B
um-hum	3881	B
yeah	3881	B
well i know that uh	3881	B
well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator	3881	B
and work out a a one or two page cost proposal	3881	B
and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program	3881	B
we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh of nonsense to for somebody to go read	3881	B
you know	3881	B
and uh you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do why	3881	B
and	3881	B
uh and i- i think one of the problems we're having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh	3881	B
when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor	3881	B
and now it seems like there's uh as many administrators and administrative assistants as we have teachers	3881	B
and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent	3881	B
um-hum	3881	B
and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things	3881	B
uh we have a	3881	B
a new sewage treatment facility near here	3881	B
that's uh one of the fine EPA approved things that does a super job of cleaning up the water	3881	B
and they have an administrative building associated with it	3881	B
that uh has-	3881	B
uh i mean i guess i get it most people i get it from uh the paper and the TV and	3866	B
i guess probably now the TV first paper second and- radio third	3866	B
yeah i was just kind of think of the order you know but uh	3866	B
yeah	3866	B
yeah i think it's uh i don't know i mean	3866	B
it's getting a little bit ridiculous i mean this- this i don't know if you saw it yesterday but uh	3866	B
where i was at had it on CNN and uh they had that press conference with that uh Jennifer Flowers uh Clinton's alleged uh mistress whatever and uh	3866	B
it just got to be so i mean it's ridiculous because_1 you know one of the questions was uh do did uh Clinton use a condom and all that i mean it was uh uh the whole press corp was just laughing	3866	B
right	3866	B
yeah i think i mean he probably did it i mean that's my belief i just think that you know if he did it you know he should have said so on Sixty Minutes and cause i mean American public is pretty forgiving and	3866	B
most times yeah if you do something i mean what else can you say- how can you	3866	B
well now with	3866	B
yeah but i mean the fact is now that he's left himself- the fact that he wouldn't deny it or	3866	B
confirm it was he's just left himself open to further digging from other reporters now you know there's all types of rumors now that	3866	B
Miss uh America Miss Arkansas all the way down to Miss Teen Arkansas well- allegedly had a	3866	B
thing with him i mean it's just going to keep dogging him i- i think he's going to be out of the race in two weeks just because_1 this is going to keep getting the fact that he won't confirm or deny i mean	3866	B
i mean he he's been this has been going on for years though i mean he's always had rumors and stuff and	3866	B
yeah and he	3866	B
no it's just i know it's just i think is just the fact that he uh	3866	B
he just flat out lied to the public that he didn't and it was totally proven wrong and then he challenged you know the press to you know prove it and they did and that's what killed him and Clinton on the other hand if he if he	3866	B
i mean he took a big risk just even going on TV the other night with his wife but i think his wife came off better than he did but	3866	B
in the end i think he's just going to his people now are you know the	3866	B
the fund the campaign you know they're going to wait and see what happens and you know when he keeps more stuff more stuff keeps coming out about him and then	3866	B
i think he'll be out uh you know he'll be out of the race eventually because_1 the money is what uh the only thing that matters in the end and if he doesn't have any money there's not	3866	B
oh yeah she she's a bimbo i mean you know	3866	B
the	3866	B
yeah but	3866	B
i don't know i mean it's just the press is always going to be like that i think and you know i mean- Americans- most i think that most people in America know	3866	B
i mean my people my age you know probably probably really don't care i mean what they i really don't you know care what they do as long as it doesn't	3866	B
but when the press says that you know some it's it's important it's got to be important because i mean they control	3866	B
i mean	3866	B
what's said and everything and	3866	B
yeah i think it's i mean yeah i think it's totally gone overboard and i mean it's issues and everything and the timing of this can-	3866	B
can be more worse for him but he he's clearly the front runner now he's about to get blown out of the water at this time	3866	B
yeah	3866	B
uh i mean he he he had i mean he had the thing won but now i mean	3866	B
i- i- i just don't think he'll be around i mean this this if you go by past history and you know he's he's dodging the subject now you know he says	3866	B
he clearly stated you know what he had to say on Sixty Minutes he didn't say anything all he said was that the American public knows that i'm mean you know	3866	B
okay what- what do you mean uh Bill and you know i'm not going to confirm or deny anything i mean that's where you	3866	B
okay	3866	A
yeah same here	3866	A
uh i hardly ever listen to news on the radio i don't even know if they have it anymore	3866	A
yeah what do you think about uh you know the second part of that question was are they doing a good job	3866	A
i'm beginning to think you know especially this week with all that stuff coming out about Clinton uh	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
i- i got a feeling that	3866	A
you know cause from- from what you know i got most of my information from the Larry King show and uh	3866	A
it was like nobody's verified her story at all and it just came from the tabloids and everybody jumped on to it	3866	A
without- and nobody's been able to verify that she's telling the truth all the only thing they know is that she lied about everything else	3866	A
would you go on national television and and uh tell the world that you'd had an affair and you know and your wife and her parents are listening and	3866	A
that would be kind of rough to do	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
i thought we were kind of through with this a few years ago when Gary Hart uh got caught messing around and	3866	A
i thought we would kind of leave private lives out of this the politics but uh	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
yeah we're waiting	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
yeah well when i heard i guess it was yesterday i heard that she'd gotten in excess over a hundred thousand dollars to talk to the this tabloid thing	3866	A
i thought well golly gee she's got to be lying i'd say i slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks you know	3866	A
maybe but	3866	A
well	3866	A
yeah	3866	A
why has the press gone overboard in telling us things and	3866	A
well if if if if somehow he clears himself from this he is all of a sudden jumped out in front	3866	A
because everybody knows his name and and knows where he's from and knows what he looks like and i'm not sure everybody knows all the other people at all	3866	A
that are	3866	A
okay well have you had to return anything lately	3889	A
uh oh	3889	A
uh-huh	3889	A
um	3889	A
yeah we haven't had to take anything back although i wonder you know if they	3889	A
sometimes i think things are made to not last as long as they used to you know so you have to buy them_1 more often uh	3889	A
and my phone is making a weird noise um	3889	A
i'm trying to think we have we just moved into our house about two years ago and we had to buy um	3889	A
refrigerator and washer and dryer and all that and so far we haven't had any	3889	A
any major problems haven't had although i keep hearing noises this morning that make me wonder if our washer is about to to uh you know	3889	A
oh uh-huh	3889	A
huh	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
oh	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
hum	3889	A
oh	3889	A
oh	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
um wow what a mess-	3889	A
yeah	3889	A
um-hum	3889	A
right	3889	A
oh they could make lots of bucks that way oh we haven't had any	3889	A
we haven't had to have anything fixed like that although we do my husband orders a lot from Land's End um catalog	3889	A
yeah yeah we've we've had real good luck with them for the most part but they have changed their sizing somewhat and because_1 i had ordered a women's blouse and i wear about a six but i usually like to order the next size up	3889	A
and i had ordered a um uh one of those little polo shirts um	3889	A
and it's really pretty small and i hardly ever wear it but so i was trying to decide what size to order this time and i went ahead and ordered the same size	3889	A
well yes i did i returned a number of things yesterday at uh JC Penney but-	3889	B
but it wasn't um it was clothing	3889	B
and um	3889	B
the blouse was uh supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my shoulder and it wasn't you know the style of the blouse it just	3889	B
i think it was sized wrong but you know it was a nice blouse but and um i took some uh lingerie back that wasn't	3889	B
well i the size that i usually buy did not fit in their in their brand it was too small	3889	B
uh but as far as large items go like appliances or things like that no	3889	B
uh-huh	3889	B
um um-hum	3889	B
well uh i would like to comment on my washer um	3889	B
um my washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise	3889	B
and you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced	3889	B
but um it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really	3889	B
and i he says let me show you and i said- i said oh yeah i see that it really needs something bad you know but it didn't uh have an affect on the performance of the machine	3889	B
what what it was the um it was a cap after your um	3889	B
after the body of the machine was in place it was under that so it wasn't visible	3889	B
and it was out of sight	3889	B
and it was rusting out	3889	B
although i don't have any rust in my clothes and i said okay how much do you want to	3889	B
uh do this repair work and he told me almost two hundred and fifty dollars and i said hey i can go buy a new one for that price	3889	B
and i said- and i said no i'm not gonna do that i said the performance of the machine is not affected by that part	3889	B
and i said and that's not that's not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in	3889	B
and um so that was two years ago and my machine is still functioning fine	3889	B
so i didn't you know and he wanted thirty five dollars for a service call and i says hey wait a minute they didn't tell me that when i called and i said i'm not paying it	3889	B
i says if they had told me up front i would have paid it but since they did not say ma'am there's a thirty five dollar service call	3889	B
but they didn't and i says i refuse to pay it and so he he had called his office and told them what i said and i- i was released from that service charge	3889	B
so you know they were they to me that was underhanded i wouldn't have minded if they had said okay uh we have that service is thirty five dollars or whatever they they charge maybe it's different um	3889	B
uh charges for different things i don't know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything	3889	B
and then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever you've got wrong with your	3889	B
you write them_1	3889	B
yeah they really could	3889	B
yes	3889	B
oh they're a fantastic company to deal with	3889	B
oh uh-huh	3889	B
um-hum	3889	B
um-hum	3889	B
oh my	3889	B
oh i do um cross stitch and some needle point	3863	B
and needle- needle point and i also crochet	3863	B
yes	3863	B
uh what kind	3863	B
what kind of hobbies do you have	3863	B
oh yeah	3863	B
what kind of music do you do do you do you perform or do you	3863	B
wow	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
uh-huh	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
oh it sounds like you are busy that's almost an occupation now	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
for uh for ham radios	3863	B
um-hum	3863	B
oh	3863	B
yeah i've always thought that was interesting i've never know anyone or or used a ham radio but i always thought that the concept was really interesting	3863	B
um-hum i didn't know how far of a of a distance i guess depending on what kind of aerial that you use	3863	B
yeah	3863	B
oh uh-huh	3863	B
wow	3863	B
uh-huh	3863	B
regularly	3863	B
that's exciting	3863	B
oh	3863	B
uh well actually yeah i've i've done some original work not very much in cross stitch	3863	B
but i- i did do one for my husband's mother	3863	B
and unfortunately she passed away the day i finished the day after i finished it	3863	B
and uh she never saw it she never knew anything about it	3863	B
it is and	3863	B
it's kind of spooky the	3863	B
the thing that i did i did the twenty third psalm the last verse	3863	B
and it was i presume you're familiar with that	3863	B
and uh	3863	B
yeah it's it's in uh it's one picture and it is hanging on the wall and i entered it in the State Fair of Texas under original art work and i won fourth place with it	3863	B
but i do pictures all around i've done some pictures oh i've done polar bears and sayings and i've done um uh sunsets and quite a few wedding and baby announcements	3863	B
most of them are already worked out i have worked up some but not many of them and the ones that i haven't worked out there's magazines everywhere	3863	B
and there's uh craft books and there's several designers that once you've you've been with a particular craft like this you get to know the designers and	3863	B
you end up having some favorites in the designers	3863	B
well	3863	B
well i do	3863	B
yeah but i've got uh a little baby he's there he goes he's seventeen months and uh my cross stitch time has	3863	B
good	3863	A
so what common hobbies do you have Cathy and	3863	A
cross-stitch and uh needle point uh-huh	3863	A
and you do crocheting	3863	A
my goodness i ought to have my wife here talking to you i think	3863	A
well i don't whether we can call it a hobby or not and uh many years ago music was a hobby to me	3863	A
but as i have gotten older i found out that music has taken over about half of my time	3863	A
and uh now that i'm i retired about uh not quite a month ago that'll be uh i guess uh most of my efforts	3863	A
well i i	3863	A
yes i play uh violin in um three different symphony orchestras local- a local one here in State College and then one in Altoona which is oh forty five miles away and	3863	A
and another one at the Lockhaven University which is about forty five fifty miles away	3863	A
and uh i formed what is called a State College Municipal Band oh about_1 ten fifteen years ago	3863	A
i play trumpet in that and conduct occasionally once in a while	3863	A
so i'm pretty busy in keeping that band going and trying to keep my violin playing up to uh an acceptable level of these other orchestras	3863	A
it does does take a lot of work and then when i have spare time i uh also am an amateur radio operator	3863	A
but i don't	3863	A
um-hum i have so little opportunity i am hopefully the next year or so going to uh rebuild my station and uh get back on the air a little bit more consistently	3863	A
i do have the equipment but as the antennas blew down the last few years i just went off the air and that uh that was the end of that	3863	A
it is it's it's a very interesting thing to talk to people all over the world it's what it amounts to	3863	A
depends upon the frequency and how good of an antenna you have and how conditions are about every eleven or twelve years conditions change	3863	A
so that uh you're signals get into different parts of the world	3863	A
man i have at one time or another talked almost not every country in the world but in all areas of the world	3863	A
i oh i have uh when i was really active i had well over a hundred different countries that i had talked to	3863	A
yeah um-hum fairly consistently yeah well tell me about this work that you do and uh do you display- display these sell them or uh how do uh	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
you know that sounds exactly like things that Pat does but-	3863	A
hum	3863	A
that is a shame	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
yeah and this is something that you would make into one square and hang on the wall is the way you do it uh-huh	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
where do you get the information to that enables you to do these different pictures are they already worked out so that you know	3863	A
um-hum	3863	A
yeah	3863	A
hum	3863	A
well that is a very interesting thing it it is awfully nice to have something to do that that you enjoy so much you can put you soul into it so to speak	3863	A
yeah i can hear him	3863	A
so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today	3828	A
yeah that's	3828	A
no i have to i have to agree with you i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the Richardson- Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak and you know it's a shame	3828	A
a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced	3828	A
something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in uh a year	3828	A
on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a stash- stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and uh when he uses- spends-	3828	A
uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing	3828	A
now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there	3828	A
well we don't either in Texas	3828	A
well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this	3828	A
as far what goes on with our	3828	A
criminal system our judiciary-	3828	A
-judiciary system and everything else it's just uh it's terrible the way it is right now	3828	A
yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if it's uh crimes like we're just been discussing	3828	A
obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them_1 off the streets but i don't think that's gonna happen because just like you said and	3828	A
our state's a good example your state's a good example and it's just not gonna happen as far as the murderers	3828	A
and people that commit rape and things like that i'm not sure what's right but i know that it's- it's not right to put him in there and	3828	A
let- let him live for years and years and years before you do execute him or whatever because_1 it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to	3828	A
i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of TV and i'm sure they have uh	3828	A
exercise facilities and movies and and everything else you know they can	3828	A
have a good time in	3828	A
no it really isn't	3828	A
it's a big it's a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it	3828	A
so i don't know	3828	A
i'm uh i'm pretty much of a hard person uh	3828	A
i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright	3828	A
oh	3828	A
you bet i mean that's the only way to	3828	A
oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them_1 and all you know it's just unbelievable	3828	A
can you really	3828	A
gosh	3828	A
oh i know see	3828	A
meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know	3828	A
yes	3828	A
the drug problems that's another one	3828	A
well i'm	3828	B
think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people	3828	B
getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they're	3828	B
given by the court system but i don't know with the economy the way it is i think crime can't do much but go up	3828	B
right	3828	B
well there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina the average serves six weeks	3828	B
well we- see we don't have any room in our prisons so	3828	B
they shuttle- they shuttle them_1 in and shuttle them_1 out and they get them_1 get them_1 early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then they're they're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals	3828	B
and it just it it's just really absurd	3828	B
i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions	3828	B
that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because_1 they realize there's absolutely- or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it	3828	B
uh yeah	3828	B
yep	3828	B
well i don't know what the answer is but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working so	3828	B
i hope so i don't	3828	B
oh i definitely believe in capital punishment	3828	B
it's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that i don't i'm kind of curious- curious about what-	3828	B
yeah you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost- almost a period of twenty years	3828	B
yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the North Carolina Supreme Court	3828	B
and then uh after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States and that usually takes another four to six years so it's	3828	B
they're hoping i guess they're what they're hoping- they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did but it just uh	3828	B
we have a serious problem in we have so many problems in this state right now and and the the thing is the the fundamental-	3828	B
the fundamental problem is the legal- is	3828	B
okay Lee tell me about your ideas on this uh the US government supporting health insurance and so forth	3870	A
well what is this going to do to the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing uh a good job	3870	A
yes	3870	A
well this is what's bothering me Lee another question do you think that there should be some control uh innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously- ridiculously over priced things	3870	A
we realize that for the individual person some things are very important uh matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it	3870	A
but by the same token some of these charges they make for	3870	A
well- well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line there should be some control of that	3870	A
yes and that's what's giving the local um insurance companies hard times that's the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals and you get something done and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it	3870	A
yes we've had several of them_1 my wife and i both have had that recent	3870	A
yes	3870	A
see that that bothers me about the government see uh my	3870	A
do you think that these- that these insurance things should be covered on a state basis or US government basis	3870	A
well i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately uh the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote	3870	B
has uh provided some very good health care and uh much	3870	B
i think inadequate health care uh and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces and i think	3870	B
um it's inevitable it is just a matter of	3870	B
uh time and mistakes and they're both inevitable	3870	B
well it's gonna make it tough for them and it's it's gonna be a difficult transition i don't know uh how it's gonna uh	3870	B
play out in terms of the particulars but i don't think society- society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long	3870	B
our uh	3870	B
physical mental and spiritual health uh it's really very costly uh and uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this my	3870	B
right	3870	B
um-hum yeah	3870	B
yeah there are abuses of they're abusive of privilege	3870	B
right	3870	B
well this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address because i know this is addressed by uh in Canada i- i have a a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in Canada	3870	B
and they made the transition uh and i think that the uh for example duplication of magnetic resonance imagers uh	3870	B
i've i had one myself and uh	3870	B
they're wonderful technologies but cities have uh three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need	3870	B
so i think that what the marketplace doesn't do because of the way the system has worked and it doesn't allocate resources optimally because	3870	B
there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills	3870	B
what's begun to change all of that the people paying the bills uh employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they've seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years	3870	B
so i think the evolution will be interesting uh Hawaii has a system that is apparently working and uh it'll be interesting to see how how	3870	B
uh much more attention we pay to that i do think though that it's inevitable primarily because of the pain uh that people are feeling uh under the circumstances and i believe that	3870	B
it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers	3870	B
uh i don't know i like that idea i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances	3870	B
with the profit incentive work very very well uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste	3870	B
that's that's that's the problem with government uh uh administration of these programs and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with government is gonna have to change in this regard	3870	B
you know that's really a tough one for me to answer i don't uh uh i would like to see the greatest improvement in management	3870	B
my my field- my field is the cognitive sciences and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done um	3870	B
as a function of the operating systems in place and those operating systems have to change and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems	3870	B
and so a state or federal application uh could work uh it all depends upon the way we structure the environment we may have to do	3870	B
-hello	3818	A
yes do you have any pets	3818	A
oh what kind	3818	A
okay	3818	A
i bet what happened to the rabbit	3818	A

oh you're kidding	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
oh	3818	A
he doesn't have any pets	3818	A
um	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
oh	3818	A
um	3818	A
um-hum um-hum	3818	A
oh for crying out loud well	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
um-hum um-hum well we don't have that problem Lady hardly ever barks at all unless she's outside playing and uh Chasta only barks like when the paper boy delivers the mail she might bark for a little bit	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
hm	3818	A
i'll be	3818	A
oh that's too bad	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
yeah that would that would really be upsetting with me too if my neighbors didn't like my dogs you know	3818	A
and uh well of course two of two other neighbors have dogs you know and they get to come over and play	3818	A
um-hum hum	3818	A
um-hum	3818	A
um-hum um-hum well some people have dogs but they really don't like them_1 i don't know why they even keep them_1	3818	A
you know really some- a lot of people have pets and	3818	A
oh yeah God mine are like my family	3818	A
at night they sit out here by the door by the patio door and look in you know sit side by side	3818	A
so every night i think for two hours every night and then we let them_1 in	3818	A
and they come in they just lay down but just i guess just the idea that they're in the house with us for a while you know	3818	A
uh-huh so	3818	A
well	3818	A
well that's a shame you know and you can- i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that that would be awful	3818	A
you know	3818	A
well that's too bad	3818	A
but anyhow we don't have that problem like i say	3818	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3818	A
well at least you can still get some right	3818	A
well that's good well let's see	3818	A
isn't it funny though i just wondered if someday this was going to happen	3818	A
hello	3818	B
i do i have a big dog	3818	B
huh oh he's just a big bloodhound	3818	B
i had some rabbits and they were much easier to take care of than this big dog is	3818	B
well we got the bloodhound and the rabbits and the bloodhound didn't mix well so they were easier to get rid of than the big dog and my kids were anxious to have a have a puppy	3818	B
uh-huh	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
huh	3818	B
okay well i've had some really interesting things happening with my dog let me tell you about this	3818	B
i have a dog that at nighttime when it wants to go in the garage because_1 he's kind of spoiled he will bark	3818	B
and i have a neighbor next door who gets real mad at this so	3818	B
for the last three weeks he's turned us into the police and in to the uh the animal control and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so	3818	B
it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my kids and to come over and kill the dog it's going- it's just berserk	3818	B
he does he has a dog himself out in the backyard that barks but for some reason this dog's bark just drives him up a wall and he's just	3818	B
i don't know it's been really upsetting he keeps calling and	3818	B
you know it bothers me when the dog barks so as soon as he barks we put him in the garage but	3818	B
i don't know what the problem is	3818	B
he is an alcoholic so i think he's just found something to vent his anger on and it's he's decided that it's us but	3818	B
uh-huh	3818	B
see that's like this dog it only barks i mean the longest it ever barks is five or ten minutes	3818	B
but you know he's called over and said he's going to get the police to take Lee away and that we're idiots for having a dog like that and	3818	B
it's just really been upsetting because_1 they were real good neighbors up until this	3818	B
this time	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
well see everybody everybody all the way up has a dog that's what's so strange every house all- you know all the way up from- on five you know five houses up from me and five houses down have dogs	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
yeah i figure why have them_1 if you're not gonna take real good care of them_1	3818	B
but	3818	B
yep that's how this one is	3818	B
huh	3818	B
yeah feel loved huh huh well i haven't i don't know what- i you know i can't figure out how to solve the problem unless i get rid of Kahuna and uh you know	3818	B
i've got to live in this neighborhood so it's almost boiled down to do i	3818	B
do i keep a pet that i love or do i live unhappily in a neighborhood paranoid of whether he's ever gonna bark or not	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
yeah	3818	B
well i'm thinking about going back to rabbits they were quiet mess free	3818	B
so	3818	B
boy	3818	B
well this is really a treat	3818	B
yeah let's hope it happens again-	3818	B
life is yeah well you know there's something that um i really find kind of maybe it's not an invasion of privacy but it's kind of annoying	3853	B
um you know phone calls uh automated	3853	B
you know i mean i- i find that really {offencing} or offensive	3853	B
yeah and they don't stop i mean they you know you call and it	3853	B
it could be any time of the day and and what happens is is they'll call especially- especially those computer ones	3853	B
they'll call and and they don't you can't get them_1 off the line you'll hang up and you pick it up a minute later and they'll still be on there	3853	B
yes i just had you know that just happened a couple day of i guess it's kind of fresh in my mind because_1 this happened a couple of days ago	3853	B
i'd picked up the phone and it's you know they started talking giving me all this spiel and then you know you try to hang up because_1 there's there's nobody to talk to there's only just um	3853	B
and- you hang up and then you pick up to make a phone they're still on there	3853	B
i know i know that is	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
but uh as far as privacy- uh invasion of privacy i there really you know i guess i'm kind of like you i don't really find it	3853	B
there isn't a whole lot that i feel like it's a invasion of privacy- of privacy um	3853	B
oh i know	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
yeah	3853	B
well the	3853	B
i guess you know there's um	3853	B
i- guess- i guess i don't think about that very often because it it has become the norm you know um	3853	B
yeah and you they find everything- i mean they find out everything about you they want to know your you know where you live what you do what you know and some of the questions yeah and some of the	3853	B
uh-huh	3853	B
yes you know sometimes that does happen you know sometimes they they would you know somebody would call on the phone and and uh you know you think it's just	3853	B
uh regular type questions but really they are kind of prying into your to your life you know you	3853	B
they wanna know uh where you live how long you been living there	3853	B
do you own do you rent you know what time of the days they're usually home what uh you know and sometimes you know you just kind of go through the routine of giving it out and then you think about it afterwards	3853	B
yes	3853	B
uh-huh	3853	B
right	3853	B
oh yeah oh yeah	3853	B
yep	3853	B
but um	3853	B
i guess it is i'm i'm in that area so it's uh	3853	B
well i'm yeah i'm in sales so i	3853	B
you always kind of uh you know it- i know that when we when i sell a product to a new customer	3853	B
that's always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that	3853	B
um you know but i know that in order for our company to survive we can't you know uh	3853	B
don't wanna take the risks so	3853	B
um i- i suppose some of those uh	3853	B
you know that's- that's the funniest thing is be rare i mean maybe one out of ten	3853	B
do we check on it yeah you know but it's kind of a routine type thing where you just do it and and you file it away and uh	3853	B
you know at random we'll we'll go ahead and check on it but um it's not	3853	B
no huh-uh	3853	B
so you know i just gather the information and and somebody else uh you know at their leisure time uh will check on those credit references but	3853	B
yeah most of them_1 are yeah most of them_1 are but they're not all you know they're not done all at the same time	3853	B
and um	3853	B
you know i- i wonder about credit uh	3853	B
i have trouble uh coming up with things that actually i've considered invasion of privacy and perhaps it's because i've become so accustomed to the fact that that's the way technology works	3853	A
what's that	3853	A
oh gosh yes yes	3853	A
i suppose that it's an invasion in that they know where you are and and	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
oh seriously i've never had that experience	3853	A
that seems unusual	3853	A
you know that almost seems dangerous because_1 what if you picked up the phone to call nine one one or something and you	3853	A
i wonder if that was a problem in their system that doesn't seem like it should work that way	3853	A
haunting you	3853	A
i used to be concerned that everyone no matter what the creditor always wanted to know your social security number but then i figured well they're	3853	A
they all have to link it back to some number that -that only you have and so	3853	A
they have access to all your records	3853	A
um-hum um-hum	3853	A
if you wanna use credit you have to pay the price and that's	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
that's probably why you have gotten those calls because they know that you're one of those people who um are in a	3853	A
i don't know income bracket or something but who has disposable income that's why they're after you	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
do you own do you rent	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
yeah i generally don't	3853	A
you know when you buy a new product how the um warranty card always asks your level of income	3853	A
and it usually says optional so i i rarely fill it i i don't think i ever fill it out frankly but uh they they wanna know they would like to come back and	3853	A
see whether or not you're gonna buy another product	3853	A
interesting	3853	A
that's how marketing works today i think	3853	A
are you	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
um-hum um-hum	3853	A
really huh	3853	A
oh yeah you don't wanna take risks	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
do you personally look at those credit uh references or is there someone else who does that	3853	A
someone else in your company does that	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
um-hum	3853	A
oh really so there isn't someone who every time does it just not you	3853	A
hm	3853	A
but most of them are checked on routinely just by someone else	3853	A
uh-huh	3853	A
uh-huh that makes sense	3853	A
okay have you had to return anything lately that you've bought	3891	A
yeah	3891	A
oh yeah that'll be nice	3891	A
i haven't either really	3891	A
right right well i think it's gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have to return it most most places are willing to you know go with the customer	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
on uh yeah i know that- i know	3891	A
that's true that's true i haven't had to return anything that i can think of but uh you know with- like radios and things they've become so cheap that even if they do break it's better just to go get another one than have it fixed	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
yeah uh the stuff like that you know	3891	A
yeah and i you know like television and stereos and things they're a lot cheaper if they're Japanese made	3891	A
you know i've i've gotten to the point where i think so but um i've had to return um i think a television one time and um	3891	A
uh the color went out but and it was like a month later and i didn't have any problem whatsoever which i think is good but	3891	A
you know years ago you didn't never have to return anything everything worked for so long	3891	A
oh yeah	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
well that's not bad at all well this is the first time i've ever gotten anybody outside of Texas	3891	A
really	3891	A
wow	3891	A
um clothes is about mainly what i've you know gotten lately and i think they've gone downhill	3891	A
as- as far as unless you it's you get what you pay for	3891	A
right	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
that's true	3891	A
right	3891	A
yeah	3891	A
yeah i agree with you it's kind of hard for the small man	3891	A
to make it you know with the the homemade thing	3891	A
you know	3891	A
um-hum	3891	A
right	3891	A
wow that's pretty interesting	3891	A
hum	3891	A
let me think of something else here	3891	A
um i can't that's the only thing i can think of is clothes you know and and they're going up so high if you want a well made you know piece of clothing	3891	A
or in matter of fact furniture also you know you have to go you have to pay a lot more it's the old adage you get- get what you pay for	3891	A
but um you know and you can get oh i know i bought a real cheap couch one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didn't last very long you know	3891	A
i think the frame of it wasn't really good because_1 it was probably mass produced	3891	A
you know	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
uh-huh	3891	A
hum	3891	A
do you have a problem with your water heater	3891	A
if you-	3891	A
um no not really i uh i may have had to have a	3891	B
a few minor repairs but i haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future i'm gonna be buying a big computer and	3891	B
um one of these eight millimeter camcorders	3891	B
so i've been i've been studying these things but uh i haven't had to return too many things i	3891	B
and	3891	B
i think it really turns down to	3891	B
picking who you want to buy from and i hate to say it but the field- the electronics devices that i buy the the ones in Japan in generally	3891	B
are much higher quality from working	3891	B
i mean i hate to admit it but it's true they and they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public	3891	B
that was made in China	3891	B
works just fine and it cost me four dollars	3891	B
yes it's amazing isn't it	3891	B
yes	3891	B
uh-huh	3891	B
that's right and and and that's been really um way it's been for me for the last five or six years that- i returned a TV set to be repaired but the problem was that uh we had a a lightning storm and	3891	B
the lightning flashed in through the power and uh hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just uh one of those circumstances	3891	B
no	3891	B
well i tell you most of my talks are in Texas that's true i but i've been- i've been uh talked into um California twice in the last uh week or two	3891	B
yeah	3891	B
well we're being filled up with a lot of	3891	B
of stores that have huge quantities of of uh clothes and articles and you know we've got Wal-Marts and Gee- Gee Bees and a whole bunch of things and	3891	B
i don't know how we can support all of those things and the and- and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them_1 on the market cheaper for the public	3891	B
and when that happens more of those products are likely to have uh inferior working ability and that's when you have to start returning them_1	3891	B
so	3891	B
yeah	3891	B
that's right and i- i- i have a friend who does make uh beautiful furniture but he has to charge twice as much when you go to a store	3891	B
if it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it	3891	B
yep	3891	B
huh	3891	B
yes	3891	B
do you	3891	B
hum	3891	B
actually i had some uh i bought a water softener for my home	3891	B
and i didn't have to return it but it didn't work well and i finally- i finally had to have the company come out and to check it out so i did have that problem	3891	B
and it was a matter- i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself	3891	B
of course my dad is a big sailor so he likes to sail and he likes to do all that stuff but it's been a long time since he's had a boat	3868	B
but we use to go to Lake Michigan and fix up you know work he had a boat that he was working on so we used to do that but i've never sailed	3868	B
i was in from Chicago i grew up around there and then um	3868	B
moved down here about ten years ago	3868	B
no it was called- it was uh it was an old forty foot yacht that	3868	B
no i mean it well no and it it was never in the water it was on dry dock so it was uh always kind of just sitting there so	3868	B
um he fishes i don't do you	3868	B
huh so do you- from- from docks or from what	3868	B

oh	3868	A
is that right	3868	A
oh that's	3868	A
well as about as a matter of fact about two years ago right now uh i've completely and totally remodeled and restored my kitchen	3893	B
yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the kitchen we've we had was um	3893	B
had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops	3893	B
at first i was- we were just gonna paint the thing and you know how everything just sort of grows	3893	B
and uh so i ended up just just tearing- tearing out the whole place and uh putting sheet rock in and building my own cabinets with ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything new floor	3893	B
well uh i'm fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own	3893	B
yeah um-hum	3893	B
i love that it's it's really pretty we had just uh Formica	3893	B
and when i built the new cabinets uh i looked into this tile deal and i thought well you know i think we can probably do this	3893	B
and um it was uh	3893	B
it was not even- not hard at all um it just i just followed the instructions the basic instructions that you use with the tile and uh they're not hard at all really it's just about anybody can do that	3893	B
no not at all um uh what we what i've been doing is just using some like bleach and it uh gets it clean but it does it has browned over the the couple of years	3893	B
you know but it really don't look that bad even though it has gotten brown you know what i should have done now that i think about it was used brown colored grout	3893	B
and	3893	B
that's right that's right	3893	B
you know because it does stain some i mean you could whiten it but i never have	3893	B
um about three months probably three or four months	3893	B
yeah yeah	3893	B
well it was for a while the worst part about it was we had to do it when i got to the sink part over here what i did was i left this cabinet	3893	B
just about this one wall where the sink is to the very last	3893	B
and um i figured well you know i'll remodel the rest of the kitchen and then when we get to that point i'll do that last because_1 we so we can keep the sink as long as possible	3893	B
and then we had we were without a sink about a week or a week and a half or so	3893	B
and um what we had to do was just take the dishes and uh put them_1 in a big dish pan	3893	B
and you get water from the bath tub and then rinse them_1 in you know for with the bath water- not not in the tub but you're just letting it run under there you know	3893	B
real really yeah we did eat out a lot	3893	B
not a thing not a thing i almost thought i had cut through a water pipe in the wall but i didn't i just nicked it a little bit it wasn't all the way through and now that was about it	3893	B
yeah well have you have you done anything like that or or anything smaller or	3893	B
um-hum	3893	B
oh no no there's nothing like that here either	3893	B
uh-huh	3893	B
oh yeah	3893	B
yeah	3893	B
sure	3893	B
right right	3893	B
oh sure yeah it does	3893	B
that's right you are	3893	B
and you're and you're half and half	3893	B
yeah	3893	B
oh	3893	B
oh i understand yeah a little latch like yeah right	3893	B
well yeah yeah everything is still so brand new yeah	3893	B
um-hum	3893	B
oh i see	3893	B
well yeah sure	3893	B
no yeah now something like that i would probably have hire- have to hire	3893	B
-okay so have you had a project recently	3893	A
that's a project	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
yes	3893	A
you must you must be pretty handy	3893	A
so you did the tile counter tops how do you like that	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
did you have or do you have any problem with staining of the grout	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
and just start out with that and uh-huh	3893	A
well how long did it take you to complete this	3893	A
that's not bad considering you did it yourself although i'm sure it was a real pain to have to live you know with everything	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
no i know what you mean sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your wife didn't cook for about three months	3893	A
did you have any major catastrophes or anything	3893	A
uh-huh	3893	A
well that's quite an undertaking uh you know	3893	A
well nothing that big a deal my husband did um he made a cedar closet and shelving out in the garage uh for us which really was nice um	3893	A
i don't know how it is in Biloxi we Dallas has no basements i suspect Biloxi	3893	A
yeah well we come from the Midwest where there's basements and you know so you have to make storage where you can	3893	A
and uh he bought the sheeting uh the cedar sheeting and put that in and i didn't know for certain how that would you know how that would work out if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out but	3893	A
it's been great we haven't had any problems with moths or anything and the extra he finished the outside painted it to match the uh garage walls which is white and it's just beautiful it really added a whole lot you know {storagewise} to the house	3893	A
but uh i think the only glitches he ran into on that i put a few nails in it so i consider myself a partner in this but	3893	A
yeah right the only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the doors he had to put in oh like some extra closure because even though he thought that the um the plywood that he got was straight	3893	A
somehow the humidity or something warped it a little bit while he was building it and we have to have a little closing you know to hold it down at the bottom	3893	A
um-hum	3893	A
but that- that was about it but our house in only four years old so we haven't done you know just a whole lot to it at this point	3893	A
um-hum although we're talking about adding uh the the ceilings here are high and the pitch of the uh roofs are very high and we're talking about adding like some rooms up in the attic space	3893	A
uh because there is so much space up there	3893	A
but uh i don't know that that's something we will undertake ourselves part of it we'll probably do you know like hanging the	3893	A
well actually uh oh the last eight or ten years i have	3856	B
an aunt and i i should say have like done our family reunion	3856	B
and uh oh you know we send out letters to everybody and we rent a place in this uh savings and loan in a in a little town	3856	B
and uh then everybody brings a covered dish and that sort of thing and uh	3856	B
it's real nice because my mother uh	3856	B
had seven brothers and sisters and if we didn't do this like the cousins would never see each other the aunts and uncles um that's the type family reunion we've had there you know	3856	B
so uh	3856	B
you know if we found you know the years we don't do that nobody- nobody sees each other because everybody lives in different places you know	3856	B
oh	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
oh	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
uh-huh yeah everybody fixes their specialty or whatever	3856	B
yeah well it really in your case and mine too uh i guess in most everybody's as far as especially more distant relatives you know uh cousins aunts and uncles and so on	3856	B
you just wouldn't see them if you didn't do something like that	3856	B
well my immediate family like on my side uh has gotten large because there's four of us and now we've all had children and now we all have grandchildren	3856	B
so that makes just my immediate family like thirty people so we do a separate reunion and we have a lake house uh about seventy miles from here	3856	B
so we we've done it once we all get together down there	3856	B
and um that works out real well because there's a lot	3856	B
well lot of things everybody can do they can fish or they can you know swim or things like that	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
uh-huh	3856	B
well it really doesn't much matter where or how you do it as long as you manage to do it every how often did like your families up there have them	3856	B
yeah	3856	B
yeah we have taken like old home movies from you know twenty five thirty years ago and and shown them at the family reunion	3856	B
uh-huh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago uh there's places now that do that	3856	B
and uh it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get about thirty or forty old reels you know	3856	B
on there and it and then you can skip around and find what you want and all that it really has uh worked out good	3856	B
so uh	3856	B
so how did you get on the TI thing	3856	B
what experience have you had with family reunions	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
huh that's really good	3856	A
yeah my mom my mom's family is all	3856	A
my family is really scattered out so if we didn't have family reunions we simply would never see each other for example um	3856	A
my	3856	A
my parents live in Seattle Washington	3856	A
however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from Utah	3856	A
and all of my dad's uh relatives and family are from Oregon so we we usually have family reunions once a year and we'll go to Utah and uh	3856	A
go to Oregon um	3856	A
my mom puts a big deal into the family reunion when they go to Utah um and um	3856	A
she sometimes plans them and and sometimes helps in planning them usually um Southern Utah is so hot that um we pick there's the	3856	A
they rent out this cabin that's up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get some- the cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time	3856	A
and that's what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also	3856	A
uh	3856	A
yeah	3856	A
yeah i know at the the family reunions on my dad's side that we go to in Oregon um we usually um	3856	A
have it at a park and so you know swimming is always part of one of the activities so	3856	A
oh there's a there's a family reunion- reunion um once a year um	3856	A
for for each for my father's side and for my mother's side i know and my wife also um	3856	A
so they try when they have family reunions they don't have them as regularly but when they do they try and make big deal out of it and usually have you know something like a talent show or	3856	A
um each family um does something	3856	A
um	3856	A
yeah	3856	A
yeah my mom- my grandma also has some	3856	A
we haven't particularly shown those at the reunions but my grandma has some home movies and we ever whenever we go to her house we like to	3856	A
see those those are	3856	A
you know nice for memories	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
uh-huh	3856	A
current events you take a newspaper	3826	A
is that right is that how you usually keep up on the news	3826	A
uh-huh	3826	A
yeah	3826	A
yeah i don't either it's mostly by the news but mine is mostly- mostly- mostly just like the six o'clock news or eleven o'clock is usually about the time i'm ready to look at TV	3826	A
uh yeah some	3826	A
oh	3826	A
huh	3826	A
yeah that's had a lot of publicity hasn't it	3826	A
uh-huh	3826	A
right	3826	A
i haven't seen it	3826	A
but it sure will be interesting to see how see it once i do figure out what all the controversy's about	3826	A
yeah i don't think we got the full story but i don't you know i haven't seen the movie so i don't really have an opinion about what he had to say yet	3826	A
right	3826	A
but who was involved that's i guess that's the story to tell huh	3826	A
yeah just like this years later maybe	3826	A
that's probably exactly right	3826	A
right	3826	A
that's right	3826	A
that's right so what brought you to San Francisco have you-	3826	A
did-	3826	A
did are you living right in San Francisco then	3826	A
oh well you're right in the middle of things then aren't you	3826	A
a job	3826	A
my brother lived out here and he and my dad owned a little trucking company and they asked my husband to come and run it	3826	A
but we lived in Concord for several years before that	3826	A
and he grew up over there in San Mateo so we know that	3826	A
right	3826	A
so we	3826	A
um about nine years now	3826	A
i do i really like it	3826	A
yeah i really like it	3826	A
boy that's for sure you can't even uh i mean it's not even fathomable that	3826	A
so the question is how do we keep up with current events	3826	B
as a matter of fact as you called i was uh taking a look at uh the San Francisco Examiner	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
uh i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour fairly regularly and uh the network news less often	3826	B
and will watch some of the talking heads programs on PBS	3826	B
uh and that's pretty much about it we don't get Time or Newsweek um	3826	B
and uh as a matter of fact i don't get any of those sort of of magazines anymore	3826	B
yeah do you watch the network news	3826	B
yeah out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock uh well they're moving the prime time schedule up from	3826	B
uh eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten	3826	B
and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here	3826	B
um will move up on all three of the local network affiliates	3826	B
i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie JFK have you have you seen-	3826	B
yeah it's really interesting to listen to how different people uh approach different topics um	3826	B
it the i didn't realize this but uh Dan Rather at CBS was the first person to view this Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination	3826	B
and he had viewed it the day after and uh got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one	3826	B
and uh it's really interesting- and he Rather wrote- later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece of uh uh evidence backwards that he'd argued like a lot of other people that Kennedy had lurched forward	3826	B
after the shot and he'd in fact been uh forced backward which lends credence to the two	3826	B
uh to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie	3826	B
i haven't either	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
it is uh you know i uh are you one of those people who believes that it was uh not a lone gunman that that we just never really got the full story	3826	B
yeah i- i haven't seen the movie either but i- i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy	3826	B
and uh	3826	B
well that's what Oliver Stone's seeking to do and i- i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes	3826	B
uh really important news comes to people through movies	3826	B
through television	3826	B
yeah and and i think that's really interesting i know that um uh my wife and i were talking about	3826	B
how uh much uh attitudes toward women uh and and the relationships between men and women husband's and wives uh are changing and i think people get more of that information	3826	B
through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper	3826	B
uh that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and and uh i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um	3826	B
it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services	3826	B
so much uh so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news	3826	B
um i came up here i was uh working for uh a unit of AT&T and was promoted i came out to California to go to graduate school and and was hired out of the PhD program um in southern California	3826	B
and went to work for a unit of AT&T and they promoted me and moved me up here and we liked it my my wife is from San Diego	3826	B
live uh right out by the park right uh right off uh Lindley Meadow in Golden Gate Park	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
yeah what took you to Texas	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
oh yeah	3826	B
uh-huh and you grew up in Walnut Creek yeah how long have you been in Texas	3826	B
that's do you like it	3826	B
that's a i- i hear a lot of good things about Texas	3826	B
it's big it's probably more affordable housing it's	3826	B
yeah	3826	B
i well i the the we live yeah living here it's just it's	3826	B
well why don't you tell me about your lawn and gardening	3832	A
do you do you have a large lawn	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
well i like the yard to look nice but i can't say i really enjoy it	3832	A
yeah no i've i've got other things that i like to do and that's that's not my favorite	3832	A
i don't know sweating- out there sweating in the sun you know and pulling weeds and those stuff	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
yeah and i won't mow the lawn either and you know watering the lawn is a pain in the butt because we don't have a an electric system so	3832	A
or sprinkler system i should say so	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
well what do you like to do when you garden	3832	A
oh so you actually grow vegetables	3832	A
well that's nice	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
yeah you know i i find that gardening for me is just uh it it's expensive	3832	A
you know you get into buying as many plants that you need to make it look good and you know you can't just buy two or three you've got to buy a dozen for one small area	3832	A
you know so	3832	A
exactly and i know we've got this spring we've got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because they're	3832	A
they kicked the bucket so	3832	A
well that means we'll just have to put something else	3832	A
and so but you know we haven't we hadn't had any freeze damage this year of course because it hasn't been that cold i guess it's been about the same with you all	3832	A
yeah and i	3832	A
and the rain is unbelievable i mean it's just	3832	A
we got a few a few flakes last week	3832	A
just enough to make it look you know i mean it didn't even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down	3832	A
yeah what about you	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
that's true that's true ours are well they're they're kind of dormant they're pretty mellow right now	3832	A
yeah	3832	A
in fact i just had a garden company come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your lawn give me an estimate because i just don't want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because because i don't know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed	3832	A
so i just let them treat all my weeds and i won't have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the garage	3832	A
well yeah it's better for us because we don't we have a pretty small lawn	3832	A
so and and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than thirty bucks so	3832	A
i don't think they do the ants i think they're just dealing with the weeds	3832	A
no because we've got a real problem they're overtaking everything	3832	A
so but i mean we got some good grass but it's getting you know um	3832	A
exactly it's getting choked out	3832	A
you you still have onions growing	3832	A
oh	3832	A
so so do you go uh give them away that you have so many	3832	A
you use them pretty much yourself	3832	A
well that's good	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
so the green onions the green onions grow into the	3832	A
the bigger onions	3832	A
wow	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
well you sound like somebody that needs to come to my house and do a little work but	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
and that stuff fades away though right	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
uh-huh so it doesn't cover- i mean it it it doesn't compete with the regular grass or anything	3832	A
uh-huh	3832	A
oh let's see it hurts um i don't know i do quite a bit of it	3832	B
um pretty fairly fairly fair amount yeah yeah we switch plants here and there do you like to garden	3832	B
oh really	3832	B
oh no no i don't like that no	3832	B
no not that part just the pretty part	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
right right	3832	B
yeah i like to get out in the morning	3832	B
and that's it	3832	B
oh mostly i like to keep a little garden	3832	B
right right right just like um salad salad vegetables that kind of thing	3832	B
and um	3832	B
that's about it	3832	B
just you know and shrubbery and everything and to keep the weeds down and stuff put mulch around it so you don't have to weed them	3832	B
it really is	3832	B
right	3832	B
right right	3832	B
so it doesn't look it looks skimpy if you don't	3832	B
oh heaven	3832	B
really	3832	B
right	3832	B
right i think it's only frozen- um we've had a freeze twice	3832	B
and it wasn't very bad	3832	B
right right did you get any snow	3832	B
oh you're kidding really	3832	B
right	3832	B
well that's nice	3832	B
no none none not none whatsoever so some of the plants are still kind of growing along	3832	B
so that makes it nice	3832	B
yeah but soon it'll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in the spring and then it kind of dies down	3832	B
a little while later when you have to take care of everything	3832	B
right	3832	B
right	3832	B
right	3832	B
wow that's not bad	3832	B
right	3832	B
do they get get rid of the ants and stuff like that	3832	B
oh oh	3832	B
not bad not bad at all though	3832	B
to the point where the weeds are taking over the grass	3832	B
oh my	3832	B
oh let's see i still have onions growing in the garden	3832	B
well they'll in Texas they'll go all year around	3832	B
and then if you want green onions you just go out there and grab some	3832	B
no	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
yeah if you put them in all times of the year you can go out and take them you know for a green onion here and there and then if you have some left over they'll go to a a regular bulb onion and then you can have that the next um	3832	B
the next time next next year yeah	3832	B
yeah	3832	B
huh yeah they will if you let them alone and then you can put them anywhere sometimes i'll put mix them in with plants	3832	B
just have a bunch of green here and there	3832	B
and then oh let's see and then um i put rye grass or my husband did put rye grass out this winter to make it look green	3832	B
um right you put it around September November to make it look green	3832	B
right when it starts getting hot um	3832	B
it'll start dying down and your regular grass will come back in	3832	B
in the	3832	B
no no no no huh-uh it has real shallow roots everything but you got to get out and mow it it looks nice for a while and then it goes away and it kind of fertilizes the grass that's there all the time	3832	B
um i have one child a little girl who's eighteen months old	3806	B
oh wow congratulations	3806	B
um	3806	B
actually even though our daughter is a year and a half we just got her last July we adopted a little girl from Beijing	3806	B
uh yeah my wife is also Chinese	3806	B
my my wife is Chinese	3806	B
and so we um traveled to Beijing and we adopted her and so we're	3806	B
she's just at a playful age right now we just do a lot of things play with her and take her to a park of course can't- right now it's too cold to go out too much here it's been really cold	3806	B
but um	3806	B
yeah uh although we were gone for most of our Christmas and we had a nice time in in California for our vacation visiting family	3806	B
so	3806	B
um yeah	3806	B
no that's where my wife's from and we also visited Seattle where i'm from	3806	B
and	3806	B
so	3806	B
we just love- mainly we we like to spend time playing games and	3806	B
um	3806	B
just she's sort of at a playful age teaching her new words things like that	3806	B
yeah so yeah your your activities probably consist of staying up at night um	3806	B
really	3806	B
-that's good	3806	B
oh that's nice	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
well we found that was important too for sleeping through the night um having um their their own room	3806	B
in fact it was almost trained out of our daughter during vacation where at our parents' house where it's just um one room for all of us our daughter and us um	3806	B
the first few nights back she was terrified to be in the room by herself but now she's	3806	B
sleeping through the night again so	3806	B
um we	3806	B
my wife um	3806	B
is we also- other things we're trying- trying to do um um	3806	B
is potty train our our girl a year and a half that's a little some people think that's a little bit early but um	3806	B
she was the foster parents our friends in China who had taken care of her before we could get her um	3806	B
have a Chinese generally potty train their children a little bit earlier earlier and um	3806	B
so um we're having spend some time with that also	3806	B
but	3806	B
and	3806	B
yeah well i'd	3806	B
she doesn't enjoy it that much but um she's learning slowly but surely	3806	B
we have a little book it talks about giving rewards and so it's a pleasant experience and things like that	3806	B
uh-huh	3806	B
yeah but there's a lot of we we're just having lots of fun with with our little girl right now um she has lots of toys got little	3806	B
she especially likes the little telephone and the little tyke bike that she has	3806	B
um and then reading she likes us to to go through the books you know and she could say a few word you know she could learning to say the names of you know a lot of simple animals and um	3806	B
and the you know the sounds that they make	3806	B
like duck says quack	3806	B
and doggy says ruff things like that	3806	B
so that's about her	3806	B
her stage right now and she's running around she she started	3806	B
when we first adopted her we she she wasn't walking yet but she was soon walking within a couple weeks after that and now she's running all	3806	B
how many children do you have	3806	A
um okay	3806	A
we've got one he's uh thirteen weeks yesterday	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
oh okay	3806	A
from Beijing	3806	A
oh okay	3806	A
pardon	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
it's not not real toasty here either but i imagine it's a good deal colder in Iowa	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
is that where you're from originally	3806	A
okay	3806	A
uh yeah	3806	A
right now uh our son's just uh dealing with grunts and squeaks and grinning and crying and	3806	A
actually no he sleeps real well at night	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
he'll he he generally sleeps through the night uh he'll go down about till- well he don't doesn't go down till about ten ten thirty which is a little tough when you got a lot of studying to do but uh	3806	A
he'll uh he won't get up till like six o'clock uh somewhere between six and eight in the morning	3806	A
he'll be ravenously hungry by then	3806	A
but he's truly a jolly little fellow and sleeps through the night too which is a real blessing	3806	A
uh it- it took about the first four weeks before he started that	3806	A
which i don't think it was quite coincidental but he started sleeping through the night about the time we took him out of our bed and put him in a crib in in the next room	3806	A
suddenly he started sleeping through the night almost consistently	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah that's good	3806	A
that's good	3806	A
pardon	3806	A
um-hum	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
that's got to be a a lot of fun	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah uh uh it's you know	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah well they they the children are gonna to eventually training- wind up training themselves but	3806	A
um they can be trained into it pretty early too	3806	A
so i remember some of the strange potty training experiences when i we were growing up amongst brothers and sisters	3806	A
so	3806	A
and we're almost kind of not looking forward to that	3806	A
anyway	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
um	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
yeah that's good	3806	A
yeah	3806	A
well this is an unusual topic what do you think about it	3825	B
well that sounds great Ellen how far away do they come from right	3825	B
oh okay	3825	B
oh okay that makes sense nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once	3825	B
um-hum	3825	B
yeah	3825	B
that's interesting you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this then	3825	B
southern California's still pretty large	3825	B
i see	3825	B
and	3825	B
yeah	3825	B
well my experience um	3825	B
has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family uh	3825	B
years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side and uh	3825	B
they haven't had a reunion since then they just show up at funerals and weddings	3825	B
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that but anyway my mother's side	3825	B
we had our our first real reunion that i've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some- some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and	3825	B
uh they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and	3825	B
people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and you know a lot of that sort of thing since it was the first one that we'd had	3825	B
the you- you could do that once now next time we have one we'll have to think of something more creative to do	3825	B
oh	3825	B
well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy	3825	B
not a passion huh	3825	B
um	3825	B
i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy and i- i suspect we will do more of it	3825	B
um i found out some about some of the relatives i didn't you know i- i didn't even know their names some of the	3825	B
two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and	3825	B
uh there's a lot of things there you have to stop they're really kind of fascinating i found out my grandmother was one of a twin and we don't even know where the twin	3825	B
we have virtually no	3825	B
no background on on her on the twin	3825	B
uh my grandmother's uh	3825	B
sister	3825	B
who would be somewhere in in West Virginia i'm sure she's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago	3825	B
i'm i'm quite a bit i'm probably a lot older than you are	3825	B
um	3825	B
i don't know	3825	B
yeah i at first i it took eight times to find you- you so i told my husband um you know what should i say and then he reminded me but um	3825	A
um his- in his family uh what they usually do on his dad's side his mom or um the aunts will send out little postcards	3825	A
like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the	3825	A
where to meet and you know just to bring anything and so they just notify everyone by mail and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short um	3825	A
or a small um dinner type thing	3825	A
um they come from	3825	A
well they all meet in Portland and they come as far as oh Seattle and and sometimes we've gone and we were from- we were living in Utah at the time	3825	A
and um but his his dad's family is all around the area and	3825	A
his mom's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern Utah and people would come from Seattle to there and um	3825	A
let's see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and they would	3825	A
um assign a different person each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody	3825	A
yeah yeah and the people who are down there like they'll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area and that person can call	3825	A
you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too	3825	A
and then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone's sort of involved	3825	A
oh well that's my husband's side and my mom's my mom's or my family- family uh we- we all live in southern California so we just have to either call or	3825	A
give a formal invite and we're all there so	3825	A
yeah well i mean LA Orange County area i mean everyone's you know mostly not farther than an hour away	3825	A
uh-huh	3825	A
oh	3825	A
wow	3825	A
well you know that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband's	3825	A
mother's side together is um they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and everyone- inevitably everyone is just	3825	A
very interested and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that and so everyone has to update their little	3825	A
books or whatever	3825	A
um uh i do but not to very much compared to my mother-in-law	3825	A
oh	3825	A
oh	3825	A
really is that your your grandma's own sibling and she	3825	A
oh i see oh so	3825	A
well maybe um they just moved away and then just sort of lost contact and	3825	A
what do you think have been the most significant changes	3819	A
so lawyers	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
well i think that's a big contributor i think women have uh really	3819	A
um begun to penetrate a lot of fields that were dominated by men for centuries	3819	A
oh yeah	3819	A
uh-huh well i think um	3819	A
one of the best things that has happened in the twentieth century has been the uh penetration of a lot of these fields by women and i think	3819	A
it's gonna continue uh and even though it's pretty difficult now for	3819	A
some men and and a lot of women i think uh	3819	A
it's gonna bring very good things and uh we're going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but it's a painful transition	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
yeah	3819	A
well i think there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and i guess that's the big thing	3819	A
you know as people change their attitudes that's gonna make the biggest difference women uh participating as equal partners	3819	A
in our society is one of the best things that will ever happen and history will record that but a lot of people really don't like that idea and uh	3819	A
no i i'm not look at what happened with the Anita Hill testimony before the Senate subcommittee and	3819	A
uh now i'm not surprised by that at all we have uh we have a two year old my wife uh works out of the home um and uh	3819	A
uh i think just looking at how uh her uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before	3819	A
so it's it it's really changing attitudes and um the economic necessity and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big difference i think	3819	A
um it's a painful transition but a really important one and	3819	A
yeah i think it's a big step for humankind and i think uh it's it's real progress but there are a lot of people with attitudes that have to change and i- i guess in answering the question that's what i would say i'd say	3819	A
that overall it's just the attitude of men and women toward equal participation and equal pay and equal political influence and all sorts of other things for women because	3819	A
that's really gonna be better for everybody but a lot of people are threatened by that as is reflected in what goes on	3819	A
yeah i	3819	A
well i think i think both	3819	A
yeah both attitudes have to change and i think uh	3819	A
um it's it's evident- evident to me as i look at all the television shows that now focus on the relationship between men and women uh watching Roseanne last night watching	3819	A
uh the show that preceded it Home Improvements all these television shows which reach the American people are beginning to reflect new attitudes and those	3819	A
well and not only i mean the the fact of the matter is that women have have carried more than their weight and are still doing that and	3819	A
um i see i think this is part of the problem for men as well as a guy i recognize that it's uh it's men who've suffered from this too because men need to learn- to learn	3819	A
uh mainly the fact that they let women in law now	3819	B
i think that had a lot to do with the way people thought about women	3819	B
not just lawyers but police officers and judges and	3819	B
the whole legal profession in general	3819	B
because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male	3819	B
and now there's women in it and i think that affected a lot of things	3819	B
oh i can i can definitely agree with that i'm i'm in a field that most people say is strictly male	3819	B
yeah mechanics	3819	B
oh yeah very painful especially when you have certain women that take very dim views on mothers that actually work	3819	B
i'm a mother of two and i still hold down a job and a lot of people say well you're not home with your kids all the time your kids are gonna turn out bad i don't think so	3819	B
some men but you'd believe you wouldn't believe how many women are against it	3819	B
yeah	3819	B
um-hum	3819	B
oh yeah and i think it's one of the biggest steps	3819	B
we or any other country in general could take	3819	B
yeah	3819	B
yep	3819	B
yeah that's for sure and you know a lot of people think that the men are the ones that are fighting this	3819	B
but you'd be surprised the majority of the people that are against women going into the work force doing you know even jobs you know on an even keel with men	3819	B
a good percentage of them_1 are the women that are fighting it and most people say well men try and keep women locked up that's not necessarily true	3819	B
i mean the women have these ideas that they got to be the little home makers and they have to stay at home or they're not doing good you know a good job	3819	B
and that's not necessarily so but everybody's blaming it on the guys saying well the guys don't let the women out	3819	B
that's not necessarily so it's just the women have to realize they can do both	3819	B
yep and the fact that women are actually getting out and working and also keeping the home together	3819	B
well it usually just means sort of getting away from the normal	3867	B
uh time spent at uh day to day job in the office and trying to enjoy the outdoors for the most part	3867	B
um i haven't done as much as i use to but i- i still like to go once and a while and go camping	3867	B
right	3867	B
the long ones	3867	B
right	3867	B
my son- my son has recently joined boy scouts and i i've become fairly active with them and and uh	3867	B
he joined about four months ago and we've gone on about three uh camp outs since then uh	3867	B
two of which involved uh back packing and and hiking they're a pretty active troop and i've i've enjoyed it it's gotten me a chance to get back out and do a little bit more again	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
yes uh	3867	B
we uh my family uh and i we lived in Colorado up until about three years ago for about fourteen years and and of course that was a great	3867	B
uh state for camping uh to get up in the mountains and it was easy to go some place on a weekend it's it's a little more difficult for me now living in Texas just because there is so much	3867	B
private land in Texas and there is not too much in the way of national forests and state lands that you can go hiking on here as opposed to states in the west i don't know how the Iowa area is for for that	3867	B
you can really- yeah really get out and hike uh-huh	3867	B
oh yeah uh-huh	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
yeah well camping- camping i guess uh different people look at it in different in different ways and and do different activities whether it's canoeing or	3867	B
camping can still be enjoyable	3867	B
yes the two burner stove	3867	B
right	3867	B
yeah	3867	B
we we've evolved to the stage of uh uh pop up tent camper camping now now that my our kids have gotten a little bit uh uh	3867	B
involved with camping and my wife finally got tired of camping in tents and having to bail out the water during rain storms and so forth so she talked me into getting a pop up camper and so	3867	B
our camping is sometimes a little more leisurely now than it use to be a little more	3867	B
yes uh-huh	3867	B
yeah it's it's somewhere in between camping and going to uh a motel i guess	3867	B
yeah uh-huh	3867	B
my- my son's boy scout troop does an annual uh one week float on the Buffalo River in Arkansas and i am trying to make sure he gets his qualifications in by next spring because_1 i would like to go on the trip with them_1 because_1 they	3867	B
camp out for seven or eight days while on the Buffalo River and they're floating floating for that many days and i am looking forward that would be uh roughing it more than i have in a long time	3867	B
um	3867	A
Tom what does camping mean to you	3867	A
uh-huh	3867	A
um-hum well when i think about camping is uh	3867	A
well back from my boy scout days uh usually means hiking out in the mountains and and uh building your own camp fire bringing your own food in a pack um and	3867	A
and things like that um things that i associate with camping usually	3867	A
the hikes and camping that we do we	3867	A
go to a lake and it might even involve some canoeing and	3867	A
and then we might	3867	A
i remember especially the fifty mile hikes where we'd we'd hike from lake to lake you know one day we'd be at one lake and hike to another lake they might be about five or ten miles away the next day and	3867	A
and things like that	3867	A
uh-huh	3867	A
well i haven't done	3867	A
much recently that's just what comes to mind when i think of camping that is what i think of and was what i did when i was a boy scout um	3867	A
well i just picture myself and i was going to say i really don't know what's available here i know there's some lakes we could drive to but i don't know of any places where	3867	A
you know you can do hiking and stuff like that	3867	A
i grew up um in the Seattle area and the Cascade Mountains were just an hours drive away and that	3867	A
that's where we did a lot of our hiking and camping um and then i lived	3867	A
while i was going to school at the University i was in Utah and there is also you know mountains there where you can	3867	A
do hiking and- plenty of hiking and camping	3867	A
yeah	3867	A
yeah i know for my from my mom um camping is um	3867	A
definitely bringing the Coleman stove and	3867	A
uh-huh even if we do build a campfire along side um the cooking is done on the Coleman stove just because_1 more convenient	3867	A
although even when my family and i went camping when we were growing up uh we went in the tents always you know	3867	A
oh in the camper oh that would that is if what makes it a little more luxurious	3867	A
well i guess the main point is to get to um enjoy the outdoors and	3867	A
you know especially if you go near a lake or mountains or you know beautiful scenery you know	3867	A
that	3867	A
well i was pretty encouraged by what happened this year and and i think with all those draft choices that i hear that they have uh they ought to be able to pick up a few more players that would help them	3877	B
so i'd i'd have to say i think that the J J Boys have done well	3877	B
oh i- i don't think there is any question that Aikman has to be the the starter because he's got the physical tools i mean that other Beuerlein stepped in and did a wonderful job	3877	B
but i don't think that you can until Troy loses the job on his own merits i think the job has to be his now that he's healthy again now if he doesn't perform then i guess the other guy is waiting to step in the wings	3877	B
but he's- but that guy's got his head screwed on right he's not causing a controversy	3877	B
yeah	3877	B
he said he'd hit the first reporter that says the word quarterback controversy	3877	B
yeah and uh but he doesn't- he doesn't like it he doesn't want that he just wants to go out and do his job when he gets a chance to play he kind of i think wants to let his actions	3877	B
speak for themselves pretty well	3877	B
yeah i'm a Dallas native so i've kind of grown up watching and i even i even went to SMU so i didn't even go away for college so i- i in uh north Dallas in Lake Highlands area	3877	B
Richardson School District	3877	B
yeah i was in the Dallas Cowboy Quarterback Club when they started it back in nineteen sixty i was uh just a little kid then and i use to go to the games and sit in the end zone for a buck of something for this little club thing they had	3877	B
i played in up through about seventh grade	3877	B
and i was not big enough to keep getting killed out there uh	3877	B
now you've got to be a Joe Montana fan a little now huh	3877	B
yeah well he's had a tough year but i think he'll probably come back yeah i	3877	B
you know if his doctor's give him the green light i- i think he will more than likely play again but	3877	B
yeah to a certain extent you know they sure have got uh they get the best back up in the league but Steve Young but i don't i don't think that you can throw all of San Francisco's	3877	B
lack of getting through this year to to the quarterback i think it's been i think it's been a variety of things they have had several key injuries in certain spots and couple close ball games could have gone one way or another and	3877	B
and uh you know they are still one of the premier uh four or five teams in the league and they're always one to beat	3877	B
so i don't think there is gonna to be any question they are going to be up there again	3877	B
another thing is some of their guys are getting a little older because_1 they have been up there for a while	3877	B
not since the season is over	3877	B
what i've been watching lately is the uh	3877	B
potential draft coming up as the players declaring which every time another good player throws his name in that means the draft is gonna be that much stronger and i have been watching the uh	3877	B
commitments of the high school players to the colleges lately cause that is going on national signing day is coming up next week	3877	B
when they can sign their letter of intent as to what college they want to go to so i've been watching to see if SMU was gonna get a few good players because_1 they've been kind of struggling along since their death penalty thing	3877	B
yeah i have season tickets so i go to all of the games	3877	B
well i was in the band there i uh was part of the spirit of the campus for a long time and uh it just we have a section of band alumni that all sits together called the Diamond M club we just we get the same season tickets every year and so we're uh	3877	B
we're all there and it's it's just kind of fun but i've got a son seventeen years old and he's gonna be going off to Rice in the fall	3877	B
and he wants to play in the the Mob the marching L band down there so i imagine i will be making a few trips to Houston or following them a couple of places to see him play	3877	B
just one	3877	B
how about you have you got any	3877	B
oh wow	3877	B
yeah what	3877	B
what part of town do you live in	3877	B
oh okay so they go to they go to Plano-	3877	B
well so what do you think they are going to do next year	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
that's right	3877	A
well which quarterback did you like better	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
i like	3877	A
that's right i like	3877	A
that's right that's his dream huh	3877	A
yeah i like the way	3877	A
see that's what i was just saying i like the way he handles the press also he's just under control on the field and off	3877	A
well that's been said plenty of times so	3877	A
speak for themselves	3877	A
yeah so are uh have you been from here all along or did you move from some	3877	A
oh well you're a unique one	3877	A
where did you grow up	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
huh	3877	A
so you've always been a Dallas fan	3877	A
is that right	3877	A
huh did you play yourself	3877	A
uh-huh	3877	A
yeah yeah see i came from the San Francisco area so i- i really liked the Oakland Raiders when they were there but then we kind of had to switch loyalties to San Francisco-	3877	A
yeah well as much of Montana as you can see anymore i guess	3877	A
do you think so there's lots of speculation whether he will or not	3877	A
yeah well well they sure went down hill without him	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
Montana	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yep	3877	A
yeah well	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
well there's not much to talk about as far as where we think the teams are heading this year but kind of a silly topic but	3877	A
oh	3877	A
is it	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
so do you follow do you follow SMU football	3877	A
yep i would say you follow them pretty closely then	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
huh how fun	3877	A
yeah	3877	A
oh	3877	A
yeah how many kids do you have	3877	A
oh that's gonna be uh a lonely house for you next year	3877	A
i have four but they're little i mean my oldest one is just thirteen so	3877	A
i got a ways to go before they leave me	3877	A
i live in Plano	3877	A
yeah uh well you know it's really ironic because it's just about a year ago today we were involved you know actively in that war that was going on at this time and uh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
yeah yeah uh-huh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
um	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
yeah well it it it certainly is not a an easy situation to deal with but uh i uh i i remember last year when the war was going on that i actually was uh if one can be	3831	A
in any way relieved when a war is going on but at least Israel listened to the uh admonitions of the United States about not retaliating uh when those missiles were dropped on them	3831	A
and amazingly we we had those weapons that would counteract those missiles so that they would do a minimal of damage uh the whole thing was very amazing to me i don't think any any of it is right i mean we should be doing any of that stuff	3831	A
oh it's such an misuse of what we are as people but under the circumstances i could not help thinking that probably uh you know five or ten years ago i don't i don't even think that same kind of uh	3831	A
respect uh sufficiently for the United States would have been there that Israel wouldn't have just gone ahead you know uh like that uh	3831	A
Arafat and the and the the P L O and everything would just you know be so rambunctious as to just	3831	A
to retaliate and even- even cause worse damage oh it was a very terrible thing but uh it's uh hm hm	3831	A
uh-huh they did	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
yeah well i guess you know so long as our uh missile systems were holding out to counteract what was being thrown in and things seemed to be working i guess it's	3831	A
it's really worth trying for peace or at least coexistence like you said uh and they have actually gone to peace talks uh since the time of that war to try to	3831	A
hit some kind of a a common ground for coexistence uh	3831	A
yeah uh-huh	3831	A
oh sure	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
um	3831	A
yeah well it amazes me that the guy is still there yeah yeah is not around	3831	A
very strange uh-huh	3831	A
you know	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um	3831	A
oh well that's hopefully not the essential issue to mankind but uh	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah uh-huh	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
oh really yeah	3831	A
mentality like	3831	A
oh really	3831	A
oh	3831	A
uh-huh	3831	A
hm	3831	A
um	3831	A
oh that's right that's right	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
oh that that's in Arabia	3831	A
um	3831	A
ah	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
um-hum	3831	A
yeah	3831	A
well it makes you wonder how- how	3831	A
okay uh	3831	B
yeah Middle East and	3831	B
yeah i guess last week was the uh anniversary of everything but uh	3831	B
that's that's one of those messed up areas i mean it's just	3831	B
i i i think that the whole operation- you know the idea of peace ever being achieved over there is just kind of a	3831	B
i don't know i mean that we're going to have peace you can have maybe some- little more stability that what they have right now but	3831	B
it's just that's pure hatred between the Israelis and the uh Arabs i mean it's just	3831	B
i just don't think they can coexist i mean because they're not ever going to you know	3831	B
it's just too many problems that	3831	B
right	3831	B
uh-huh	3831	B
yeah i'm i'm amazed uh Israel didn't even uh	3831	B
you know retaliate that that that's one of the most surprising things	3831	B
i'm but	3831	B
yeah in fact Baker was uh	3831	B
a speech yesterday trying to get them back they're supposed to be going back to tables pretty soon the next week or two i think but	3831	B
uh they'll you know they'll work out some type of an agreement and something will pop up in about five years and	3831	B
the fact that we never got uh Hussein out hopefully that will fall apart on its own in the next year or so but	3831	B
i mean if he ever gets any type of military power back i mean for that area that's just going to be same situation again and	3831	B
i don't know Bush	3831	B
i just think should have gone in and just take- take him out that would have that was a major problem	3831	B
just him being just	3831	B
he's powerless but still the fact that he's still in power it's over there that's a symbol of	3831	B
he stood up to the evil force of the western world and i mean that's just completely different mode of thinking and	3831	B
to them what they view- view as reality is just simply opposite of what we view but	3831	B
so i it's	3831	B
i just i don't know the only thing that keeps us there is the oil and i guess the only good thing that came out of it is we would be paying twice as much more now for gas but	3831	B
i mean	3831	B
well it is for the money makers out there i guess but	3831	B
i don't know it's it's kind of hard for me to really	3831	B
imagine i mean i've never even been over in that part of the world and i had a friend of mine that got back and	3831	B
he's sort of there and he's just said that he just really he couldn't stand the the	3831	B
uh Saudis at all because_1 he said they just didn't have any respect for them at all and just	3831	B
yeah- they didn't	3831	B
he just really had a hard time you know	3831	B
you know i- i look at it as a he looked at it as a job he wasn't like	3831	B
because_1 he didn't like the people and no one did he said they just didn't they didn't want them over there the people they didn't like them and	3831	B
you know they had all these rules you couldn't bring any type of religious artifacts in or	3831	B
any type of alcohol anything like that he's just	3831	B
and they they have like this they look down at the soldiers- the American soldiers and he said it's just	3831	B
you have a hard time you know fighting for their cause	3831	B
and to me to it's i don't know it's just it's just totally backward everything you know black is white and	3831	B
white is black to them i mean that doesn't make sense but	3831	B
okay i work with uh a lot of students and uh in my uh occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think uh	3884	A
the advice that i give to would give to uh parents i've had four sons- five sons that have gone to college- uh to uh college	3884	A
i think uh one of the main things is that they they choose a local college that uh or university	3884	A
that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if they're in the local area they don't have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things	3884	A
and uh	3884	A
and	3884	A
go ahead	3884	A
uh-huh	3884	A
yes it is	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
uh that that's uh kind of the the advice that i give and then uh they need to take a look at the uh courses- uh the courses of study and uh how it would go into their their major minor field uh	3884	A
what kind of placement uh they have in the particular area you know i had one son who uh went to a smaller college uh to uh went out in the uh premed area	3884	A
but they had an excellent record of placing uh their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was	3884	A
right he got early acceptance to a to medical school after he finished and uh if he would've gone to uh say the state uh it would be the University of Utah	3884	A
if he would've gone there uh i don't know whether he'd got accepted to medical school there or not	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
yes uh	3884	A
um-hum	3884	A
and you you can do this for any of the uh any uh university or or for any of the students that are planning uh take a look at uh their final goals at least hopefully they've got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then uh	3884	A
if it's law school or if it's uh medical or whatever	3884	A
there are different uh colleges and universities usually within the state that uh have a little- little better placement record or or getting them into into those higher degree or higher areas of education	3884	A
i see uh-huh	3884	A
um-hum you bet	3884	A
um-hum and uh that would be school- a school that the parents uh should seek out for their uh students if they're interested in that that field and	3884	A
and where it's well known uh the word gets out and that that might be a a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the the uh to to go to to Penn State	3884	A
um-hum yes	3884	A
um-hum you bet	3884	A
um-hum well that's very important in in a choice of a college or university that they look at those aspects uh wherever they might be	3884	A
and if it's uh financially if they can do that that's that's great	3884	A
but they- they need to know about the the costs and uh how they're going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh	3884	A
uh the bottom line is uh the the college or university that's gonna give them the best training prepare them for life	3884	A
um-hum	3884	B
yeah that's certainly helpful	3884	B
say your last suggestion there about	3884	B
staying within state i realize that there are a lot of schools unless uh uh the student has a real specialty	3884	B
and there oh maybe are one or two universities that are highly respected in that field they really ought to try to stay within their state i mean	3884	B
financing in universities now is getting a very very high	3884	B
and they can't help themselves on that either so it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state	3884	B
yeah	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
that's very important	3884	B
well that was certainly uh good advice to get him to go to a school who follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their students that	3884	B
that means that the quality of what he was taught must be very very high	3884	B
and that's good for him too regardless of where he works he has uh a top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
well we have that same situation here i'm i'm a retired professor at Penn State	3884	B
and uh the field i worked in was acoustics	3884	B
and we have an acoustics department here and we- have lots of students several hundred i guess in in acoustics and they have an excellent opportunity to	3884	B
follow through on their fields because our university is well known for it's research in addition to uh teaching obviously if we can do	3884	B
high class research we must be well trained and and uh available to teach the students well	3884	B
yes	3884	B
yes	3884	B
yes because_1 Penn Penn State is very well known in uh many of its uh many- of its fields and	3884	B
uh we we get a lot we do we only we get our sort of say we get state uh students not only from out of state but from all over the world	3884	B
i mean they they they really come here we have a very high uh percentage of foreign students because Penn State is pretty well tops in many of its fields	3884	B
and we have doubled in size in the last fifteen twenty years i guess	3884	B
um-hum	3884	B
yes that's true	3884	B
yes and then the basic thing is that you started out earlier to say the the bottom line is to give your	3884	B
declined that	3885	A
San Francisco has more crime than Texas	3885	A
it's a it's a difficult question i don't know that i uh can easily come up with an answer to what can be done	3885	A
i think probably drugs have a lot to do with crime in our society today so	3885	A
no no	3885	A
it's it's hard to know actually whether the	3885	A
crime um impact would	3885	A
be better or would- would decrease or would increase if there were some changes in the way drugs are legislated i don't know if	3885	A
i have uh an opinion yet about uh legalization of certain kinds of drugs but	3885	A
uh-huh boy there's certainly a lot connected with that you know	3885	A
organized crime as well as	3885	A
huh	3885	A
well i guess	3885	A
yeah i grew up in a pretty small town and i'm not sure that um	3885	A
the size of the community or the general appearances safety really has as much to do with it because because you're seen as an enclave You might get hit by somebody from the outside anyway	3885	A
um i guess on a on a local level uh i i was thinking when i heard the question about major changes in the country today but it's probably a little easier now that i think about it if i look at what an individual could do and obviously	3885	A
if you have lights on and you have uh uh a timing system for your lights in your own home you're going to reduce the risk of being broken into	3885	A
right right looking less like a victim	3885	A
neighborhoods watching each other	3885	A
yes	3885	A
in a southern California suburb It was outside of Long Beach kind of near Huntington Beach	3885	A
oh really yeah	3885	A
i've lived in San Francisco for about thirteen years now and um probably have learned by	3885	A
uh indirect and direct experiences about things to do to you know avoid those kind of situations but i think part of it's just as you grow	3885	A
as you mature you you recognize um how to present yourself in a public situation so that you don't look like you are a victim a potential victim	3885	A
it's a hard thing to communicate to kids isn't it	3885	A
i have a two year old	3885	A
no no but you know as a child we were able to uh ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our friends and those are things that i'm not sure i'd be comfortable with when she gets to bike riding age you know	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
that's interesting how large a community is that	3885	A
uh-huh and and Plano what would you say is the population	3885	A
because sometimes it's hard to you know i i look at small towns that have had problems with kidnappings and i think	3885	A
well the you know they're not on the edge of some large metropolis Um you know it's hard to even	3885	A
look at the factors that influence that happening why why in that particular you know	3885	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3885	A
uh-huh do you find yourself teaching your children things that uh you you know that they need to do but you didn't have perhaps in the way of level of awareness at an early age	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
uh-huh how how do they respond to that when you tell them about kidnappings at what age were they ready for that	3885	A
uh-huh how old were were they when you introduced that subject	3885	A
uh-huh huh	3885	A
uh-huh	3885	A
oh gosh a scary experience	3885	A
than Plano Texas yeah i sure am	3885	B
i don't think there is an answer of what would make crime go away there's no such thing	3885	B
yeah i think you're right	3885	B
have you ever had your house broken into	3885	B
i haven't either	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
that's for sure	3885	B
that's for sure	3885	B
i've never really been a victim of a crime and i've never had my car stolen or my house broken into or	3885	B
any of that so	3885	B
i've always lived in suburbs i don't know if that has anything to do with it or not but	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
right there's so many things that you can do in that way and you know going into parking lots with	3885	B
with your keys out being prepared you know being on the defensive	3885	B
right	3885	B
yeah we have a neighborhood crime watch where i am where did you grow up	3885	B
uh-huh	3885	B
yeah well my girls and i were just just down there this Christmas they play soccer and so we were down in that same area	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
but	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
that's right yep	3885	B
it sure is do you have children	3885	B
yeah they're not afraid of much at two	3885	B
yep i can understand that you know as we were traveling back from that same soccer tournament i was telling you about we stopped in Mesa Arizona	3885	B
and i was just amazed at the freedom that those kids felt they just don't have i mean even here in Plano Texas i worry when my kids	3885	B
walk you know a block	3885	B
and we talked to some of our relatives there and they said you know we just don't worry about that there aren't kidnappings and there aren't	3885	B
there isn't that element here yet	3885	B
um i don't really know it's not real big it's right outside of Tucson	3885	B
uh i don't know that either	3885	B
it's	3885	B
yeah	3885	B
why it would happen here and not there	3885	B
yep	3885	B
i guess you just have to kind of look for a family environment and and neighborhood and hope for the best you know and just	3885	B
sure	3885	B
sure it- and it's so frightening because you have to teach them to be scared all the time	3885	B
and to really be cautious	3885	B
well they don't know any other way they don't know any other way i mean they weren't raised when i was when you didn't worry about that everyone worries about that now so they just assume that you'll always have to be on your guard	3885	B
and this	3885	B
oh real young i mean i can remember when my my oldest daughter is thirteen today	3885	B
and when she was just three i took her to the Sun Valley Mall do you know where that is	3885	B
yeah i grew up there in Concord	3885	B
anyway and um she had gotten lost	3885	B
and it started right then	3885	B
you know and every person i would see that had a little girl you know tucked under their arm i'd run you know	3885	B
to see if that was her	3885	B
oh yeah	3885	B
uh what kind of lawn and garden work do you wind up doing	3842	A
um-hum	3842	A
okay	3842	A
okay	3842	A
okay	3842	A
okay this sounds kind of like slightly jumbled situation there	3842	A
uh that good income huh	3842	A
yes	3842	A
okay	3842	A
yes	3842	A
do- do you enjoy gardening	3842	A
yeah it's real relaxation	3842	A
uh my father ran a service station for thirty nine years and his	3842	A
i mean when- when i was a kid i didn't realize how true it was but he always said that that was the best way he knew of to wind- to wind down after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden	3842	A
and especially you know just hoeing just- hoeing up the weeds it was therapy to him	3842	A
and i guess it still is but uh	3842	A
and i didn't seem that way when i was like ten years old but	3842	A
oh yeah yeah um we had about a quarter of an acre worth of lawn between our my- my parents' house and our next door neighbor	3842	A
they were a rather elderly couple so we cut their lawn for them_1	3842	A
but uh	3842	A
there's about a half acre worth of garden we kept	3842	A
so when the kids and	3842	A
dad we	3842	A
well uh since i moved away from home i got to live in a place that had a yard	3842	A
so i not really	3842	A
yes we've actually gotten to the point where uh for a while i couldn't seem to keep anything alive	3842	A
i couldn't even grow weeds in the house	3842	A
but about three years ago my wife and i somehow another seemed to have turned into green thumbs we got we pinched off a uh a couple- couple of a twigs from a house plant of her mother's	3842	A
and wrapped them in a wet paper towel and brought them_1 home with us	3842	A
and put them_1 in a jar of Miracle Grow and water and these this thing took off and we planted them_1 and now it's a plant uh plant we pinched them off of was kind of full and leafy but it was only about	3842	A
eight inches high off the top of the pot this thing's about five feet tall now	3842	A
and- i don't know	3842	A
it- it's this you know some little broad leaf something or other we	3842	A
but uh it's it's got real thick thick stalks to it that like i say it's the couple of those stalks over five feet tall	3842	A
but uh they're just growing like mad once we got that thing going we wound up with about five or six other house plants that are all doing real well some people gave us some aloe vera and it	3842	A
it's doing well i mean it's had it's bad spots but	3842	A
uh it's had its rough times but yeah but it's it's doing real well now um	3842	A
i brought her a uh a couple of-	3842	A
i don't even know what they're called looks like overly large lawn grass but it just a broad leaf type of lawn net kind of like a a leaf on a stalk of corn but uh greener it's	3842	A
short house plant pardon	3842	A
yeah well it doesn't get a stalk the the leaves all come out of the center it doesn't really resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself it is- about_1 like the shape of a leaf a leaf on a stalk of corn but it's not on a	3842	A
stalk it's just all out of the center	3842	A
yeah and uh it doesn't seem to flower any and let's see we've got a little somebody gave us a Fichus and uh	3842	A
uh when we first got it no well we came close we got really close	3842	A
um when we first got it she kept moving it back and forth from our own front porch to the uh inside and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside	3842	A
and it had shed almost all its leaves it looked really scraggly and rough and when somebody finally told us the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them_1	3842	A
i have um we own a house that we rent out	3842	B
and i- i rent the house that i live in	3842	B
and the house that i'm renting- the house that i live in had the landlord provides the yard work	3842	B
the house that we own i provide the yard work	3842	B
i know well the the one that i live in is not nearly so nice as the one i rent out though-	3842	B
i wanna preserve the the the- value of the house by making sure the yard is taken care of	3842	B
so i- i go over to my other house and mow the yard and plant bulbs and flowers and	3842	B
i adore it	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
yeah	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
did you mow the yard when you were younger or do stuff like that	3842	B
ooh	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
do you still do yard work	3842	B
oh	3842	B
do you do anything anything like um uh house plants or	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
oh gosh	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
uh-huh	3842	B
ooh what is it	3842	B
oh	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
i killed an aloe vera	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
oh yeah um corn plants those are called corn plants or- or Dracaena or they're some kind of Dracaena but common name's corn plants i think-	3842	B
oh	3842	B
oh huh	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
huh that's i don't i know i have one of those that's not doing very well but	3842	B
i think i know what you're talking about	3842	B
you- you haven't killed it	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
um-hum	3842	B
how do you get your news coverage	3886	A
uh-huh	3886	A
oh that's pretty nice	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
right	3886	A
yeah that's just about all i get is the evening news and the and the newspaper sometimes i wish the evening news was like an hour long instead of thirty minutes	3886	A
but that would be nice to have uh um you know- all is it an all news uh radio station	3886	A
uh-huh	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
i- i guess i never i never really tried that it probably is on the AM i know it's not on FM	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
yeah	3886	A
well it's probably picking up um KLBJ that's a real famous	3886	A
um uh Lady Bird used to own it	3886	A
radio station here but um they're not so much news as they are um uh as far as musicians and and things going on around Austin	3886	A
you know	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
um-hum	3886	A
some subject yeah	3886	A
well not bad that sounds pretty interesting	3886	A
right	3886	A
oh i guess Dan Rather i'll switch around i'm not really partial you know one like Monday i might have one and Tuesday i might have another one you know just to get a different view	3886	A
you know or just someone different but uh	3886	A
yeah um-hum	3886	A
yeah yeah it's a little draggy	3886	A
yeah until it gets a little boring though i know there is something better on	3886	A
so it- it's pretty nice in that the newspaper here it's it's it's only you only have one newspaper and um it's it's kind of biased	3886	A
but um it it's all right	3886	A
yeah it's very conservative i would say it's very conservative but you know being it's only you- you don't have one in the evening and you don't have a choice	3886	A
and you know i don't i don't like that but other- i have uh uh small newspaper community um that's oh it's- it's um	3886	A
uh just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people and uh it's free and it's real nice	3886	A
yeah i really like it you yeah it- it's like the small hometown newspaper you know you can put your kid's picture in there if they had a birthday or or something like that you know or some	3886	A
well um most of what i do is um listen to the news in the morning when i'm heading to work um	3886	B
we get uh we have two different stations here that run uh National Public Radio and i really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when i'm driving home from work so that's where i get most of my stuff uh	3886	B
yeah we we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the Washington Post here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper	3886	B
and uh so it's you know it's it's uh between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to uh listen to the evening news but not very often how about_1	3886	B
yeah i don't blame you it's it's uh it's	3886	B
yeah and it actually	3886	B
well no i it's i guess what is it it's um it's kind of a talk radio station it's run by a university here called American University or at least that the the general program that i listen to National Public Radio itself is um	3886	B
a uh uh a syndicated thing that's run by a group that operates here in Washington uh but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good	3886	B
especially in Austin come to think of it uh that you're going to be able to get it down there uh	3886	B
yeah	3886	B
well i don't know whatever your you know it it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and uh and so forth and and uh	3886	B
this uh the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize it's kind of a bluegrass station or something	3886	B
um but uh yeah that that's i'm i'm dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special features on Austin it's a real interesting radio program because they they don't just cover-	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um -well that's very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as i'm driving home	3886	B
and um what they do is they they give you uh about a five to ten minute news uh broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they they cover	3886	B
um topics either of current interest or every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on on some uh particular thing like yeah like perhaps- for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah it's uh	3886	B
yeah it's real good and it it it uh the other thing is is is- my politics are kind of liberal and and um so they have a tendency being public radio to	3886	B
sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you you've got to give them_1 credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story	3886	B
and uh they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves either	3886	B
yeah yeah i'm the same way but the the evening news on TV it's it's really it's so short that you just uh i don't feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh McNeil Lehrer report on public TV	3886	B
i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long	3886	B
and uh with- you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i i used to try to watch it used- used to make me feel like oh well this is uh something i should be watching	3886	B
yeah exactly and	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
which way which which way does it lean is it conservative or	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
um-hum	3886	B
oh wow	3886	B
that's good yeah	3886	B
well that's interesting-	3886	B
uh probably not from what i've been hearing i mean there's not enough getting done	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
well you think this AIDS thing has been around since about nineteen eighty and	3843	B
i would have thought by now they'd have been a lot more advances	3843	B
in treatment and then again i guess there is i mean there's some drugs that they didn't have and	3843	B
i'm sure that didn't come cheap	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
it's pretty uh	3843	B
yeah i keep thinking that myself	3843	B
i i was i last year when the war thing was going on and it was over and they said it costed you know like seventy billion or something	3843	B
and they said if they had that much money for AIDS research they could have found found a cure	3843	B
so i kind of wondered about that i mean	3843	B
to me that's an astronomical amount of money and uh	3843	B
but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
there again that doesn't seem like a whole lot of money	3843	B
you know if to do something like that with	3843	B
uh but i i kind of agree with you we should spend more in this country for not only AIDS but a lot of other things before we start helping other countries	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
i mean in in in your own financial budget if if you're not doing well you're not going to help out anyone else	3843	B
but but that's not the way this country is or ever been i think we've always	3843	B
they had reasons for it i think i heard one just the other day that	3843	B
because of all the money he was you know giving away right now uh the president was i think his wife said something with well like we've got to keep these countries in a democratic mode	3843	B
uh sometimes i don't think it matters	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
my wife and i used to work at a research laboratory for the government	3843	B
and i know things go slow	3843	B
an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing sometimes	3843	B
so i understand	3843	B
you know where the money gets ate up at and	3843	B
but there really should just be more	3843	B
and now that	3843	B
yeah and now that uh you know the weapon spending is going down	3843	B
but we could put some of these laboratories even like the one we worked at at Los Alamos we could put them onto you know more AIDS things	3843	B
not that i know of	3843	B
i think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the street and i heard a rumor that one of them died with AIDS	3843	B
but i never knew for sure i met them once or twice because they used to sell plants in the yard but	3843	B
i never really considered that i knew them so	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
yeah	3843	B
actually-	3843	B
do you think do we spend enough on that or	3843	A
oh yeah	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah i just kind of wonder uh you know i've been thinking	3843	A
i don't know how much they spend on cancer and how much they spend on AIDS and some of those other things but it seems like uh	3843	A
you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of people that are affected uh cancer seems to affect a lot more people and you'd think they need to spend more on that but	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah that's true it's uh i don't know it's kind of interesting issue you wonder	3843	A
now it's gotten so out of hand that you know it's not just that the homosexual population and stuff like that uh you know it's affected everybody just even if you go to a hospital it's	3843	A
kind of hard to know what to do and	3843	A
you really i don't even think they have really a decent- a decent idea of how many people really have it i	3843	A
i would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and	3843	A
it's kind of a scary-	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
wait whether amongst	3843	A
yeah seventy	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where we're getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country you know or to support the Soviet Union this that and the other and	3843	A
you know i sometimes wonder if it's not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems and you know AIDS being one of them to	3843	A
i think didn't the President put i don't know if it was a billion or so more dollars or something in the budget this well i guess it was in ninety one to try and find a cure for it or	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
yeah it's kind of kind of ironic ourselves we're on the down trend and here we are trying to still pick other people up and	3843	A
seems like that's all we ever do and it comes back to haunt us in the long run	3843	A
but	3843	A
yeah yeah that's true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own house and put your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and	3843	A
yeah i	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
no and and	3843	A
yeah i i i agree that just	3843	A
and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know i guess if we didn't help the Soviet Union there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but	3843	A
you know we're either paying for it in weapons and arms or we're paying we're giving it to them for nothing you know	3843	A
and then we you know at least we have jobs when we're making all the weapons and stuff it seemed like and now we don't even have those because we cut back so much and then we give it away and you just wonder what we really get out of it	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
more money spent	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
well uh do you know that much about i mean have you ever met anybody that has AIDS or	3843	A
yeah i've never met anybody myself but	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
uh-huh	3843	A
yeah	3843	A
just more passing but	3843	A
yeah i just i haven't had anything strike home so it really hasn't hit me as bad and and sometimes- you know you tend to sometimes wonder well hey you know you kind of brought it on yourself but like i say now it's getting so much more in	3843	A
into society that people that you know have no intention of doing anything you know kind of end up with it and	3843	A
you know little kids and stuff like that that	3843	A
that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to	3843	A
to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other	3843	A
you know type diseases out there it seems you hear a lot more about the AIDS activists than you do these other people with these other diseases and	3843	A
how do you get most of your news	3874	A
what are your favorites on TV for for news programs	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
uh that's terrible i know i should know these but is Dan Rather	3874	A
C B S	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
are you one of those people that tends to like to go through the paper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something or do you tend to like to read at the end of the day	3874	A
yes that's the way i am	3874	A
oh that's nice	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
right	3874	A
yeah	3874	A
oh really	3874	A
sometimes it feels as though what i'm reading in the newspaper is the old news it's as if i heard it just the day before on the television and i wonder where they get a lot of their stories but i think that	3874	A
the one that i'm i feel like i get the most information from is is uh McNeil Lehrer and sometimes it's on in the afternoon if i'm if i'm home but i work most the time so um	3874	A
the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal because	3874	A
yes you're preparing dinner but you still have an opportunity to to look at it occasionally we have a little two year old so there's not a lot of time to for me i feel to spend as much time with the	3874	A
updates as i'd like to i think i probably get more of it from Lee because he works out of our home and um	3874	A
it it seems to me that McNeil Lehrer spends more time with each issue therefore i can count on it being more accurate uh because they've really spent more	3874	A
development of the story as well as research and	3874	A
and i get a better picture of what it is that i'm hearing about i- i wonder about the authenticity of the others um i- i have a feeling they get a lot from UPI and AP and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and	3874	A
just give little spots to it and	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
um-hum	3874	A
right and certainly in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press from some activities because they didn't want to have a lot of political fall out i think but there was probably	3874	A
some repetition of of stories that didn't have complete um confirmation i wondered that about the whole Clinton thing recently um you know something coming out in the tabloids and being picked up by a major media	3874	A
uh one of the accusations obviously is that they didn't go down there and research it and and get enough information i don't have a preference or an opinion really on that story one way or the other but it's uh	3874	A
yes	3874	A
this is true	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
uh-huh but it is always interesting to hear the follow ups you know on any kind of major presentation you always get the analysis	3874	A
uh-huh	3874	A
well they all have their perceptions too you know they may have heard the exact same thing and that's just their	3874	A
well that's a a good question um	3874	B
i read the newspaper obviously and and watch TV	3874	B
and uh	3874	B
uh we have one here at at at six o'clock in the evening to seven where we have local news followed by uh	3874	B
and i- i- i can't name the CBS i guess it is	3874	B
who is- who is the gentleman that uh	3874	B
MC's that program	3874	B
yeah i think in fact- i think it's Dan Rather yeah i- i- i have uh been- just retired recently so i have had very little time really to watch	3874	B
TV and uh to get the news so all of my time that was available was between about six and seven uh obviously i scan the newspaper	3874	B
and um i think	3874	B
no	3874	B
i get mine at the end of the day	3874	B
i at least i used to and now i'm beginning to read it about noon since i just retired i- i retired from Penn State and i just uh now i have some morning time available	3874	B
and it used to be that we got our newspapers in the evening which i liked because that's when i could read it and i felt like it was fresh	3874	B
and for the last two or three years our newspapers have been coming early in the morning and it's been six or seven o'clock at night before i got to read it	3874	B
and i had already heard all kinds of conflicting things during the day before i read a newspaper	3874	B
yes	3874	B
uh	3874	B
uh-huh	3874	B
well that's my normal time six to seven for here	3874	B
um-hum	3874	B
how do you feel about the authenticity of these various uh methods of presenting- of representing the news	3874	B
yes i always wonder about the accuracy of their source of information that's what bothers me particularly you know when we're had this business of the of the war over there in Europe i mean i always wondered about	3874	B
it that they based what they said on whoever told them well whoever told them_1 might not necessarily have the accurate news and know of the overall- know the overall	3874	B
story	3874	B
yeah	3874	B
um-hum	3874	B
well then the the only thing that you can be sure of the uh has gotten it straight from the horse so to speak is did you hear uh President Bush's speech the other night	3874	B
well at least we know what he said	3874	B
and we we don't have to to uh read in the newspaper what they think he said or what the Democrats think he said we know what we heard him say	3874	B
yes	3874	B
that's when you find out of all the disturbances that are in the background that know one else knows about that's the problem when you're in a politics	3874	B
there's always somebody working behind your back and- who just doesn't want you to get your way simply- because_1 you're on the other team well that's ridiculous really	3874	B
yeah yep	3874	B
never did worked for a lot of computer companies in my life but not that not TI	3848	A
uh	3848	A
credit cards	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
sounds like a good you ready to get started	3848	A
okay	3848	A
i stay away from them no	3848	A
uh i keep two i keep uh i got a Visa and it keeps a little balance on it not much and American Express is the one i use predominantly so i know i have to pay it every month	3848	A
i know when i was younger twenty years ago or so i i got into quite a bit of hassle with them charging to the limit like to never caught them up	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
i've had oh one time i had an erroneous charge show up on it from some	3848	A
credit card protection company or something and that took me a few months to get that reimbursed and uh find out what was going on there they had authorized they had paid somebody without my authorization	3848	A
and	3848	A
i think the final letter was they were sorry that happened	3848	A
boy	3848	A
yeah i've never gotten into an interest	3848	A
never gotten into an interest charge with American Express i know they have it but i just	3848	A
you know if you get it paid within the next thirty days or something you don't have one so	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
yeah it's kind of hard to get by without one you know it's	3848	A
i rent a lot of videos you got to have one there and different places and so you just about got to have a major credit card my favorites though are department store credit cards	3848	A
uh you can just stop in and shop when you want and don't have to worry about your check book or having cash	3848	A
and	3848	A
i found out with at least the two department stores we've done business with for years they treat you much nicer	3848	A
uh when you have a balance you pay it and	3848	A
there's never a problem with anything you want or anything uh and our give give the cards to my sons say here go get what you want	3848	A
that sort of thing	3848	A
so those kind of particular credit cards i've always liked	3848	A
yeah	3848	A
right when i work that's the way we uh i had a	3848	A
corporate card with American Express with my company and	3848	A
everything was put on that they didn't care what was put on there just	3848	A
and i i usually	3848	A
i think one time in all those years i had a situation where my refund check you know my reimbursement checks hadn't gotten here in time to make you know a payment of five or six thousand i had every month too and	3848	A
i mean just one time	3848	A
um okay	3848	B
subject is credit cards and how we use them	3848	B
okay	3848	B
i guess so	3848	B
now what's been your experience with credit cards	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
well i i uh i belonged to American Express many years ago	3848	B
and uh they had a reputation or at least they touted that uh don't go don't leave home without it type attitude that it was good in Europe and everywhere	3848	B
and i went on traveled in Europe and i was just absolutely appalled at uh	3848	B
the they it was useless	3848	B
and uh i think uh	3848	B
being overseas for about five weeks there was three occasions i got to use the card	3848	B
uh one little hotel out in the middle of nowhere in Scotland one little restaurant in Denmark and things like that	3848	B
and uh later i uh well i get in a scrap with uh American Express because they made some mistakes in my account and it just took too many letters to get it straightened out	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
well i	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
well it was something i don't remember the exact details so long ago uh they tried to sell me some kind of a special card	3848	B
you know gold card or super card or diamond card and so to do that they had to change my account	3848	B
and so	3848	B
some bills came in under the old account after they transferred all the money out	3848	B
and rather than credit you know move the bills to the new account and pay them off as they should they sent me this statement showing this huge interest charge on uh	3848	B
on the account	3848	B
and it took took me a while to get that straightened out	3848	B
yeah well i tried writing letters to get it straightened out but it uh it took about eight months and i finally said cancel the account and	3848	B
after about four months they quit sending me letters	3848	B
uh	3848	B
and now i only carry one really uh my wife insisted that i get another credit card and uh so i do have a Visa card	3848	B
yeah	3848	B
uh-huh	3848	B
yeah well i have another credit card our company when you travel uh because of the tax regulations they don't like to make cash advances	3848	B
uh because there's uh they're concerned with the tax liability there so uh rather than make a uh cash advance they issue a credit card and you just charge as you go	3848	B
and uh	3848	B
send your paper work in and by the time the credit card bill comes in presumably you have your check from the company the	3848	B
in dollars and lives and the long term effects	3834	A
you ready i i'll hit it if you're ready to start okay	3834	A
my name's Karen by the way what what's your name	3834	A
San Francisco	3834	A
oh nice to meet you	3834	A
ready to go	3834	A
what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war	3834	A
you you think it was a winnable war then	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
you mean the effects of of of Vietnam being to encourage him to to be more defensive in his posture and go for	3834	A
i meant offensive i'm sorry uh-huh	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
um	3834	A
i do think one of the effects was that the uh people involved in that kind of an um activity were surprised at the power that the media had on um intervening and probably	3834	A
set the tone for media's involvement in future whether it was a war activity or	3834	A
something along those lines that are going to involve a number of people	3834	A
everything changed after that in terms of media	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
well you remember in the Gulf War they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in	3834	A
Vietnam war they weren't about to have people out in there reporting	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
um	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	A
that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least	3834	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3834	A
uh-huh	3834	B
well uh	3834	B
oh i'm ready yeah sure	3834	B
Karen my name's John Benyak where do you live	3834	B
oh i live in Dallas	3834	B
just outside of Dallas	3834	B
nice talking to you	3834	B
what's that mean we're ready to go	3834	B
okay well it uh the way it turned out it wasn't worth anything really i just don't think i've always thought that uh	3834	B
it just wasn't carried on the way it should have been it wasn't carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just uh	3834	B
we	3834	B
well i think we'd uh we'd uh beat them i don't think uh	3834	B
i don't know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but uh i think if we'd uh had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war	3834	B
instead of letting the politicians and the	3834	B
and the peace and people like that dictate the terms of the way we fought i think things would have turned out a lot differently	3834	B
oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and uh or at least it is now and there's no way	3834	B
that if we'd uh been able to take uh	3834	B
use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have uh what would have lost it as a war uh the long term effects well	3834	B
i uh i don't know that's that's a little tougher to answer i think uh	3834	B
depends i guess on who's in office but uh i think Bush used that uh last year in the Persian Gulf uh by taking some stronger stronger measures and when the war started	3834	B
be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they decided-	3834	B
once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much uh	3834	B
run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in Vietnam is that uh they we escalated and uh just you know on a gradual basis and gave the	3834	B
um North Vietnamese and Viet Cong time to adjust to our uh	3834	B
increases in uh personnel and so forth they just didn't go in there if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially uh i think things would have been differently but different but it uh they went from	3834	B
having the advisors uh up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the uh	3834	B
the enemy just gradually adjusted to that and	3834	B
they didn't uh the people the country the people here didn't want the war the way it turned out they didn't want it that's	3834	B
uh-huh	3834	B
right	3834	B
oh really	3834	B
right well there are	3834	B
yeah there were every every night you'd come home from work and uh or school or whatever and see it on the uh the news i	3834	B
imagine that wasn't the case during World War Two or any of the other wars uh people just didn't feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of	3834	B
a lot of	3834	B
uh-huh	3834	B
right	3834	B
right yeah but uh i just uh	3834	B
i i guess i was in my let's see	3834	B
my twenties during during most of that war and i i never did think that they were they were doing it right i i'm just not a uh a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her i mean that she'd go around speaking on different campuses and	3834	B
getting people uh aroused about the whole thing and of course uh they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that's what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority and	3834	B
people were listening to to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt	3834	B
i was in the service at that time i wasn't over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn't fight it like they should have and it's a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you're over there and	3834	B
people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and	3834	B
either win or lose based on the fact that it's a war and not just uh uh mealy mouth their their way through the thing and try to get the um other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth	3834	B
oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have lost- i i i just don't think we could have lost the the	3834	B
okay so what- now what are your opinions on recycling	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
yeah i've heard that too	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them_1 and uh that's- i can't remember where i went to take them_1 but they wouldn't- they wouldn't take them_1	3876	B
oh i know	3876	B
there's no really recycling facilities	3876	B
i think that's a good idea	3876	B
besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in New York or isn't it	3876	B
um-hum you get ticketed if you don't do it right	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle	3876	B
yeah that's true	3876	B
yeah i've seen them_1	3876	B
um-hum	3876	B
that take them_1 back	3876	B
is Texas one of them_1	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at JC Penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling	3876	B
program that's um company wide and i do the recycling for that	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use	3876	B
but um we use to have uh i mean i- i don't even remember how much money that they've um mean- i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities but i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didn't you think of that before	3876	B
yeah that's true	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like	3876	B
then that's pollution	3876	B
yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor	3876	B
yeah	3876	B
truly sad	3876	B
well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility	3876	A
until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late	3876	A
you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand	3876	A
and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my paper- i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take	3876	A
plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them_1	3876	A
and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait -until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile	3876	A
um-hum	3876	A
yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that cannot- glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to	3876	A
no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out	3876	A
and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
i think so it's just because they have to you know	3876	A
right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and	3876	A
so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state i'm from	3876	A
uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay	3876	A
ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back	3876	A
you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just	3876	A
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i don't know if you've tried it	3876	A
and they have on the back- it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that	3876	A
yeah well what- some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now	3876	A
Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them_1 away cause there is no place to take glass	3876	A
so	3876	A
uh-huh	3876	A
okay do they save like the paper they- they use like the office paper good because_1 there is a lot of waste there isn't there	3876	A
right	3876	A
right	3876	A
right	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton	3876	A
you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business	3876	A
and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that	3876	A
yeah yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it	3876	A
and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried	3876	A
and i don't know it just may overwhelm us	3876	A
here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late	3876	A
very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well	3876	A
that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it	3876	A
yeah	3876	A
and then just like the glass bottles that- that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and there's no place i can take glass to	3876	A
so i still throw away a lot of glass	3876	A
yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic-	3876	A
yes i do i uh go on long walks whenever i can and uh	3827	B
well when i when i can fit it into my schedule and the weather's right i like to walk uh oh three four miles a day	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well that sort of same sort of thing happened to me i used to be a regular swimmer i i taught at a university and i you know could use the pool every day if i wanted and since moving away from the university environment i've uh	3827	B
now it's kind of difficult to find a pool that's convenient and affordable to swim in	3827	B
but uh what university were you at	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
did you say you're at the University of Iowa Iowa City huh	3827	B
i went- i visited- visited there once quite a few years ago had a friend who was in the linguistics department there	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well you would do you have contact with any of the uh people in linguistics	3827	B
yeah	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well if you ever run into uh to Cathy Reagan say hi to her for me i think she's still there	3827	B
um-hum	3827	B
well how briskly do you walk do you think how how fast do you walk do you think	3827	B
uh-huh	3827	B
well a brisk walker can go maybe what four or five miles an hour so if it takes you a third of an hour to get in you're probably going oh i would say at least a mile and a half probably	3827	B
yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go walking just about anytime i want to	3827	B
this winter though it's rained so much that uh there've been times where see my uh favorite	3827	B
uh area to walk is a a greenbelt they have right through Plano here and uh	3827	B
you know it's it surrounds a little stream over much- much of its extent you can walk for miles there and never cross a street you you go under the streets	3827	B
but uh when the uh when the water is too high uh you'd get washed away i mean they have signs up there warning people to stay away so	3827	B
we've had that uh a number of times recently not to mention the mud of course	3827	B
well you can get you can do the other thing i do is uh i have a little exercise bike that uh wasn't too expensive i got a cheap one but you can really work up a sweat on it	3827	B
yeah	3827	B
yeah i- i really prefer outdoor exercise i'm afraid that my favorite indoor exercise is eating apple pie a la mode and that doesn't help very much	3827	B
um Ashley um do you exercise regularly	3827	A
uh-huh well that's pretty good i unfortunately uh am not um exercising regularly at the time um	3827	A
i	3827	A
we've recently made a move i used to be at the university where there's facilities there and my wife and i regularly played um racquetball	3827	A
but um since we've moved to Iowa now um we don't have as many facilities like that um	3827	A
i was at Brigham Young University	3827	A
um actually i am working at a university right now i just graduated with my PhD at Brigham Young and i'm working at the University of Iowa however	3827	A
we had all free benefits for faculty and staff and students at Brigham Young but um	3827	A
oh it's we the benefits here as far as um using the physical facilities are not free here so and plus they're not as convenient we're we're further away so it's not as convenient for like my wife to come in you know for doing things together	3827	A
uh-huh right uh-huh	3827	A
oh	3827	A
i'm in uh	3827	A
at the National Center for Voice and Speech which is part of the um Department of Speech Pathology	3827	A
um	3827	A
well uh	3827	A
i just- i haven't been here uh uh only for several months and uh i- i'm sure that there must be some cooperation between the departments but uh i'm not aware of anything as yet	3827	A
um	3827	A
i	3827	A
okay	3827	A
okay usually when the temperatures are warmer um i live about twenty minutes from school so um	3827	A
from the university so i often will walk in which i guess it's i'm not sure how far it is um actually it's twenty five minutes and it's probably about a mile- i don't know long- it's got to be maybe a	3827	A
what	3827	A
oh i walk rather briskly but i don't i don't do it during these winter months it's just far too cold um	3827	A
so-	3827	A
yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um	3827	A
uh-huh	3827	A
uh-huh	3827	A
oh	3827	A
oh yeah	3827	A
but-	3827	A
yeah if i were to begin- to begin exercise now i think it'd be something that i could do um	3827	A
indoors something that's convenient	3827	A
um	3827	A
you know	3827	A
-it's like an exercise bike or something like that although i haven't purchased one purchased one yet sometimes i do- i have this little trampoline-	3827	A
small type trampoline that i do indoor jogging on sometimes for exercise but i haven't really started- been doing anything regular for the last several months since we've since we've moved to to Iowa	3827	A
well outdoor exercise is uh more convenient however-	3827	A
the federal budget boy	3894	B
i was just writing something down that	3894	B
came to mind as i observed what's happened in our society	3894	B
um	3894	B
we i think have become	3894	B
uh dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that really only we can do for ourself	3894	B
and i think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to that	3894	B
uh	3894	B
we have elected people who really don't know how to manage	3894	B
the money uh they collect	3894	B
i mean i think it really affects all of us to a degree Glen i think we are i mean i- i went through a P H D program that was funded by the Office of Navel Research that's now investigating Stanford and Harvard and MIT	3894	B
i mean we're talking about things that have done some good but have institutionalized corruption	3894	B
right well and we need to spend the money better i mean we do not need eight hundred military bases around the world	3894	B
there are lot of things we don't we don't need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we don't need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy farm- i mean basically	3894	B
you know it it is really true that this this country is suffering because um we are it's not that we don't have the resources we are just squandering them	3894	B
that's the way it was working on a defense department contract that's what happened-	3894	B
right well that's the way the that's the way the thing works	3894	B
that's right i've seen that happen and it's it what's even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations	3894	B
is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because we're the smart guys and without us society can't function and that that's no license to steal	3894	B
i mean i- i honest to God believe that's what- what's been going on and that was sort of seeped into the way we operated in those contexts	3894	B
and at the time i you know people i mean it was it was acceptable it's no longer acceptable	3894	B
right	3894	B
right and it it's not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldn't survive	3894	B
and do a a you know variety of other things if we put the money in the right place which is investing in people in the development of human capital	3894	B
in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought they'd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and	3894	B
right	3894	B
well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they haven't been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard MIT or Stanford education if it's that good and you really	3894	B
right but all the people who who are responsible for handling these kids were trained in universities and colleges	3894	B
okay and my point is hey wait a minute something's wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if it's the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around	3894	B
okay so ask yourself some questions why don't we have a higher quality with one of the world's great universities Harvard and Stanford both have schools of education	3894	B
i mean this is a focus it's not like this isn't an interest of theirs this is a specific focus two of the best funded institutions in the country	3894	B
premier universities in the world hey wait a minute how come they can't produce something like MTV which kids want	3894	B
yes	3894	A
i agree with that	3894	A
well what we've got um in my view is is a situation where	3894	A
we've got more people like you say that are customed- that are accustomed to being taken care of and than we	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
yeah well i- i really i think if you from a	3894	A
yeah i- i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think we're gonna have to eventually balance the budget or we're gonna sink	3894	A
we can't continue to pay the kind of interest that we're paying on the deficit	3894	A
that's true	3894	A
oh yeah throwing them away uh it's just like uh uh programs that are federally funded that if they if the they don't spend their allotment uh	3894	A
then they're then they're subject to losing the next year's allotment	3894	A
yeah and go into a spending frenzy at the year of the end- at year end	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
right that's true	3894	A
well and	3894	A
well and- well and so many people have have uh the feeling that well if it's if there if it's federal money then it's free money well it's not it costs everybody	3894	A
and uh it- you know just because you can uh get something from the feds uh uh that doesn't necessarily make it morally uh responsible	3894	A
well and and and well don't even began to talk about the educational system i mean is that is one example where it's being proven that throwing money does not create a good education okay-	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
yeah but i'm even talking- i'm i'm not even i'm not even talking about higher education we're- i'm talking about the the kids that we've got now they come out of high school that can't read and write	3894	A
and that also it just even the ones that that do read and write that really have a very poor poor grasp of of what a secondary education should have given them	3894	A
uh true	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
yeah	3894	A
um-hum	3894	A
right	3894	A
uh i crochet uh in in fact uh that's what i was doing when the phone rang	3892	B
yeah i'm making a baby Afghan uh for my daughter-in-law's sister-in-law who's expecting baby number one at age forty	3892	B
so i feel uh i feel like she needs a goody	3892	B
uh-huh	3892	B
oh my	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
no i- i really don't uh in fact this is the first thing i've crocheted in in uh some time	3892	B
but uh my grandmother taught me to crochet when i was five years old which is a long long long time ago	3892	B
so but i- i don't knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the the gauge doesn't work	3892	B
uh	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
hum i know i know	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
yeah well i'll tell you how i sort of feel about it	3892	B
i- i feel like uh of course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity	3892	B
but it- it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else is doing it	3892	B
uh the the if it's not real recreation	3892	B
it's- it's it's not doing you any good	3892	B
uh-huh	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
no no it doesn't it you either do it or or you either like it or you don't you either have a knack for it or you don't uh	3892	B
and and and uh again i- i feel like that	3892	B
if there's something else that you'd rather do uh	3892	B
some people have a natural green thumb	3892	B
uh and uh if that's what you like to do fine but if you don't	3892	B
then uh get a second job and hire somebody	3892	B
do something that you like to do uh	3892	B
life is too short uh	3892	B
i enjoy crocheting it it's real recreational- recreation for me but	3892	B
uh and and i used to sew a lot but uh and i just don't have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending	3892	B
but uh you know uh if you don't like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and uh	3892	B
hum-um dump it	3892	B
yeah	3892	B
um-hum um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
um-hum	3892	B
well what hobbies do you have	3892	A
oh you do	3892	A
are you making an Afghan	3892	A
oh how wonderful	3892	A
oh my goodness	3892	A
well i have a sister-in-law who had a baby at age	3892	A
forty and i think again at forty three so she's	3892	A
but i'm expecting too so on my first	3892	A
but um i don't uh the only thing i really have done in the past is um	3892	A
uh cross stitch and needlepoint	3892	A
um i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels	3892	A
where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven	3892	A
i've done that kind of stuff but i haven't done anything as big as an Afghan	3892	A
do you do that often	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
hum	3892	A
um-hum yeah that	3892	A
um i just haven't been	3892	A
oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt	3892	A
um i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that that make them_1 but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays	3892	A
you know because i work full-time outside the home	3892	A
and then you don't have the time because_1 you're tending to the child	3892	A
but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things	3892	A
right	3892	A
hum	3892	A
yeah i think that's true um like some people make uh um decorating their house a hobby	3892	A
and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that	3892	A
you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does	3892	A
and so uh you know we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a cop out but yet	3892	A
if if i- i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it	3892	A
but um my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with age and with years of experience- you know	3892	A
hum	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
yeah	3892	A
um-hum	3892	A
um-hum um-hum	3892	A
yeah	3892	A
yeah isn't that true	3892	A
we uh in fact mending it- you- even kind of has gone by the wayside for some- most for many people if they get a hole in their sock	3892	A
they don't darn it they they uh	3892	A
uh throw it away and buy a new pair	3892	A
but um	3892	A
yeah there's a lot of things that i think that i'd like to do	3892	A
but i don't make the time to do them_1 you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then i'll have more time to do it and um	3892	A
because_1 i like committing a a great amount of time to something if i'm working on it	3892	A
hello how you doing i'm Lee with uh uh i'm over here in Plano Texas	3830	A
oh sure	3830	A
oh	3830	A
where are you calling from or where are you at	3830	A
Arlington well there's a	3830	A
lot of	3830	A
stuff going on in Arlington these days	3830	A
are you involved in any of that no	3830	A
well uh what benefits uh do- now do you work	3830	A
oh you are	3830	A
okay	3830	A
yeah because_1 i- i work for myself and so uh	3830	A
uh there's a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come but uh	3830	A
oh is that right	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
yeah i uh i own part of a roofing company	3830	A
in the in the Dallas Fort Worth area	3830	A
and uh you- you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we we had all the benefits there and and i do miss that you know but uh on the other hand i	3830	A
i uh	3830	A
i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and	3830	A
being able to you know work when i want and	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
oh is that right	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
it's a	3830	A
yeah it really- probably- it probably- yeah i'll tell you what that is the single most uh benefit that i that i	3830	A
enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just	3830	A
and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it	3830	A
and uh yeah	3830	A
oh yeah even at a group rate uh it's it's unbelievable and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's	3830	A
that eats even more so yeah i guess what the other benefits that uh	3830	A
that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the	3830	A
bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know and course these days you can't count on that because	3830	A
uh you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh	3830	A
GM deal there in in Arlington and i'm i'm sure it'll be you know quite a few people are affected by that so	3830	A
uh-huh	3830	A
oh really	3830	A
is that right	3830	A
the Union yeah	3830	A
is that right	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
well really the	3830	A
yeah really the ones it's gonna hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area you know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh	3830	A
oh yeah	3830	A
yeah	3830	A
um-hum	3830	A
well i tell you i i've had my fill of unions i use-	3830	A
oh yeah-	3830	A
hello fine	3830	B
okay let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off okay	3830	B
okay	3830	B
Arlington Arlington Texas yes	3830	B
yes not all good stuff	3830	B
no no i'm not not personally	3830	B
i'm going to school right now i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what i think i've got a lot of	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
yes right	3830	B
yes	3830	B
yes i've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact i'm selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having	3830	B
that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits weren't there so	3830	B
oh do you yeah	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
uh-huh	3830	B
yeah	3830	B
right	3830	B
yep um-hum	3830	B
i think today the thing that i uh	3830	B
would appreciate the most uh because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine	3830	B
and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured	3830	B
i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to have- you need to have	3830	B
right	3830	B
it's out of sight right it's out of sight	3830	B
even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our	3830	B
right it goes up right	3830	B
um-hum	3830	B
right	3830	B
right	3830	B
right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the GM people come in when they were they would shut down to retool	3830	B
they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this right- yes	3830	B
they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and	3830	B
every Friday and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these great- i- i really believe they have done this to themselves	3830	B
in a way because of the unions being so strong	3830	B
and right now anybody that's laid off from GM will have a full year's paycheck	3830	B
i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at	3830	B
at uh through the company so i'm sorry- you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check and that would be it	3830	B
yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah	3830	B
but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them_1 in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know	3830	B
and it made the prices of cars go up and	3830	B
and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far	3830	B
i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour	3830	B
i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour	3830	B
convenience uh	3854	B
i- i use them_1 for just- uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard	3854	B
but um i- i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um	3854	B
uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one	3854	B
uh has a twenty dollar- it's a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i- i pay off every month	3854	B
there's no interest charge	3854	B
but and we never carry over we pay off every month	3854	B
well one thing is whenever we rent a car we don't have to pay um any extra insurance	3854	B
so that we uh my husband's uh family lives in New Hampshire	3854	B
and uh	3854	B
it's about_1 ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston	3854	B
so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car	3854	B
so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
oh dear	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
yeah uh-huh	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
uh-huh	3854	B
um	3854	B
can can you buy groceries with it	3854	B
uh-huh yeah	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
yeah i think so too	3854	B
no it's not	3854	B
yeah you really can and uh also um	3854	B
we travel abroad	3854	B
some	3854	B
and um it um you get MasterCard's accepted everywhere and and you get the	3854	B
a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in traveler's checks of course there are	3854	B
yeah and and even uh converting your traveler's checks at a bank they still charge you a fee	3854	B
and uh	3854	B
um-hum	3854	B
yeah um-hum um-hum	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
yeah	3854	B
yeah we do too	3854	B
do you use credit cards	3854	A
it	3854	A
do you	3854	A
uh-huh	3854	A
i see	3854	A
what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you don't pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa	3854	A
i see	3854	A
i see we used to get the American Express card and	3854	A
stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um	3854	A
benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so	3854	A
uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we don't do	3854	A
or other types of services i'm sure there're some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh i've just wondered what they were they haven't been appealing to us so far	3854	A
yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know you've arrived you've got this card	3854	A
and uh	3854	A
you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh	3854	A
so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i don't know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the Visa- Visa and MasterCard and they said fine we'll give it to you anyway	3854	A
and we said you know	3854	A
so	3854	A
they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and	3854	A
it's wonderful in that respect and we're glad to have them_1 we we	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
it's great you know and it eventually what we're gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and it'll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i don't think the Discover card's gonna make it in the long term	3854	A
um you know we don't need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but it'll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because_1 the price will come down	3854	A
i don't think it's worth fifty five bucks a year	3854	A
when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and they're pitching that in all their commercials i notice	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
yeah	3854	A
well now- now that's interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the conversion fee probably	3854	A
right	3854	A
well it it's gonna come that way and the reason it's nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources	3854	A
anywhere in the world and that's where we're headed the technology supports that nicely	3854	A
and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen	3854	A
and you don't get uh anything charged to you and that's great it's just insurance we're very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them	3854	A
it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever	3854	A
um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA	3854	A
yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh that's a great thing for-	3854	A
what do you think about drug testing	3808	A
yeah i think that it's appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and	3808	A
you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other people you know health professionals and people who	3808	A
uh operate machinery and fly and or drive whatever i think that those are really important i'm not sure how i feel about about other jobs just	3808	A
uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is	3808	A
drug free you know on on general principles	3808	A
but i can really see the justification for the others	3808	A
uh-huh for all job categories	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
so whether you're an executive behind a desk or you're operating a vehicle or whatever	3808	A
and- and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean	3808	A
so in the past month	3808	A
oh since nineteen ninety one it started is that right	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
when you say infrequent is it maybe once a quarter or	3808	A
how large is that group	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that	3808	A
that the company chose to do that	3808	A
was it insurance issue or	3808	A
safety issue	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
so uh on a performance level there was actually	3808	A
a problem with abuse of substances and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
yeah	3808	A
what kind of a company is it	3808	A
oh i guess i should have figured anybody i talk to in Texas is- is probably from TI	3808	A
interesting well	3808	A
they really i guess i shouldn't stray from the subject but they have some very interesting topics for for questions	3808	A
i often wonder who has created them	3808	A
was the response from the employees regarding drug testing favorable or	3808	A
oh really	3808	A
interesting quit on general principle	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
uh-huh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and	3808	A
be interpreted correctly	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
do you know if anyone's been uh	3808	A
um	3808	A
disciplined or	3808	A
so even if it's you know one time	3808	A
uh-huh	3808	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3808	A
seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that	3808	A
well	3808	B
unnecessary- a necessary evil i guess	3808	B
well	3808	B
yeah uh i guess i'm uh	3808	B
partly biased since we just recently our company's gone to the uh process of	3808	B
initiating drug testing on a random basis	3808	B
everybody uh in the corporation	3808	B
that's correct	3808	B
well it's uh	3808	B
other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and	3808	B
and supervision taking the uh being done within the first year	3808	B
which we've all been done you know	3808	B
uh seems to be	3808	B
the past year	3808	B
uh right actually- late in ninety it was	3808	B
but you know they it's fairly infrequent it's just that it's there you know	3808	B
oh Lord no i don't think uh	3808	B
first of all in my group	3808	B
hardly a fourth of them have been tested you know	3808	B
uh it's about uh twenty people	3808	B
well	3808	B
that uh they want to you know social uh issues	3808	B
yeah i think that	3808	B
that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh	3808	B
Texas Instruments	3808	B
yeah	3808	B
yeah i guess there uh	3808	B
may have been just a committee throwing out suggestions	3808	B
it was uh it was received at our site here in Houston	3808	B
fairly easily however in Austin where they have a lot of engineers and uh	3808	B
i guess a younger set uh people they uh they were pretty uh a lot of people quit over it and uh quite a	3808	B
quite a bit of furor yeah	3808	B
i guess yeah there was some people that just actually quit because of the	3808	B
their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know	3808	B
uh i don't know how much of that there is i don't think it's that big of an issue because they've hired a national company and it's you know handled	3808	B
third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that	3808	B
oh yes they've they've they've been people that have been uh	3808	B
the company has a	3808	B
you get a two step process the first time if you're caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if you're not you know	3808	B
still have to go into a program even	3808	B
yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user or whatever	3808	B
then uh after that first time- chance then the second time it's automatic termination so	3808	B
yeah well it's	3808	B
it's almost become a uh non topic anymore-	3808	B
okay here we go so what's your favorite team	3814	A
naturally huh	3814	A
oh really	3814	A
it's um like seventy five miles from Oakland and San Francisco	3814	A
it's in the valley	3814	A
okay	3814	A
well i used to be a Raider fan when they were there but now i'm a 49er fan	3814	A
you know and the 49ers just went down down down this year	3814	A
yeah	3814	A
yeah- yeah right right	3814	A
so what- what do you think's gonna happen Sunday	3814	A
i hope it's Buffalo	3814	A
you know i'm really i'm	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
yeah lost by what one point	3814	A
yeah	3814	A
uh-huh	3814	A
well at least Dallas was in the play-offs you know	3814	A
yeah	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
um-hum do you get to go to very many games	3814	A
uh-huh	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
hm um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
um-hum	3814	A
no i've never been to a 49er game i used to go to all the Raider games when they were in Oakland and	3814	A
uh it would be nice yeah but uh i don't think that's ever gonna happen	3814	A
you know um now i'm just waiting for something to come out- out this way out in the valley	3814	A
Sacramento still has a chance i guess of getting a team someday	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
so you plan on uh watching the game Sunday	3814	A
um-hum um-hum	3814	A
well that'll be nice- yeah that'll be nice yeah we're gonna have a little few people over to watch the game you know just serve hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that so we won't have to miss out on anything	3814	A
so	3814	A
i know it's too late huh	3814	A
yeah i was wondering for sure what time it started i thought it was three or something but you say it's four out here huh	3814	A
six o'clock your time huh that's terrible	3814	A
yeah yeah yeah	3814	A
well	3814	A
yeah um okay then it's been nice talking to you Brad all right bye-bye	3814	A
so uh	3814	B
uh Cowboy fan die hard	3814	B
yeah ever since i was last sixteen seventeen years well- as long as i can remember yeah ever since seventy six but um yeah big time they are uh	3814	B
everyone's jumping on the bandwagon now after the season they had what part of Patterson	3814	B
and- that uh that California is that	3814	B
oh okay so you're up-	3814	B
okay	3814	B
so i guess you're uh	3814	B
yeah	3814	B
there you go there you go	3814	B
yeah but if they would've made- to the play-offs i mean they were they were the hottest team i thought at the end of the season it's just it's kind of	3814	B
it's kind of bad that they miss out on the play-offs with a tie breaker or whatever but	3814	B
that	3814	B
uh i think it's um Buffalo	3814	B
i- i really do i think it's their time to	3814	B
everyone's picking Washington but	3814	B
i don't know i mean i think the AFC's been getting beat up every year you know lost a few Super Bowls	3814	B
because_1 they went last year they should have won it and you know missed that kick but	3814	B
yeah pretty bad for the kicker but	3814	B
i think they'll do it i mean naturally Redskins	3814	B
and the Cowboys don't have a	3814	B
much like for each other but um	3814	B
yeah it's	3814	B
the- the way they went out that- didn't go over and it got killed by Detroit but they're young team i mean they got all those draft picks next year i mean their future's	3814	B
i mean they're one of the young i mean they got so many stars and with Jimmy Johnson i mean you never know what he's gonna do it's just that guy's a wizard drafting people	3814	B
i went to four games this year actually um	3814	B
friends of mine have season tickets we've always- it's always um each year we've taken turns in getting them_1 and kind of	3814	B
switched around on them_1 everything and i just graduated and i moved back so i got to see more games finally	3814	B
i went to school at Texas Tech out in Lubbock Texas for last four years so i saw the games on TV but i hadn't been to any since yeah Thanksgiving once i guess	3814	B
so you make any- many 49er games	3814	B
yeah i guess it- still want them_1 back in Oakland huh	3814	B
yeah i guess there's not many Al Davis fans out there	3814	B
uh you got just- so many	3814	B
yeah there's so many teams out in California though i mean that's what the Rams the Raiders the	3814	B
uh uh that's just	3814	B
yeah um going Super Bowl party actually so um	3814	B
i'll be out there for do it every year how about_1 y'all	3814	B
right	3814	B
and there you go	3814	B
yeah i- i just wish it would start a little bit earlier because i guess well out there it starts at four but starts at six here you know that's	3814	B
i don't i mean people you know that they're wondering why their ratings go down every year it's because_1 people get don't like to	3814	B
yeah i mean but- a time because_1 lot of people you know they got to work the next day they don't wanna be sitting around at nine or ten at night and	3814	B
you know they start taking off but	3814	B
yeah it's six- it's six o'clock here like six eighteen so it'll be	3814	B
but it's one good thing about living out there daylight everything	3814	B
but um	3814	B
well i guess that ought to do it	3814	B
okay yeah all right thank you later bye	3814	B
i'm fine i want to know where you're from	3835	B
oh are you	3835	B
i i am too	3835	B
are you at the Christ United	3835	B
are you in Christ United Methodist	3835	B
oh okay	3835	B
well okay well um anyway um i'm with a a choir and and we've been doing this as a fund raiser i wasn't sure if they were still doing it or not but i know that's not what we're supposed to talk about	3835	B
okay i'm having dinner right now and and on the subject of food so just continue and you tell me something you'd like to tell me about food	3835	B
uh no i'm not actually i wish i were	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
oh that's going to be easy	3835	B
oh well i guess my my favorite recipe that i've seen this week was fried green tomatoes did you see that in the paper	3835	B
right right	3835	B
well you know i don't guess i have i mean i'm from Mississippi originally and surely you know i don't even know that i've ever seen it offered to tell you the truth and but this- this evidently is a Southern delicacy that i didn't know about	3835	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3835	B
right	3835	B
well i tell you if you see that movie it'll make you want them_1	3835	B
oh yeah it just they just really make it look good now i love things like fried okra	3835	B
and i try not to ever have fried things but still you know if i i think uh that the fried green tomatoes would be something like that	3835	B
probably you probably bread them and and uh you know like with corn meal and that kind of thing and then	3835	B
fry them_1 in grease	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
ooh nice	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
oh	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
oh i bet that was good i know i would like that	3835	B
do you work um in any particular what particular- what area do you work in	3835	B
at Spring Creek in what what area	3835	B
manufacturing because my husband is works for TI also	3835	B
uh-huh he's at he's at Spring Creek but he's manager of	3835	B
<b_aside> what are you manager of honey <e_aside>	3835	B
telecommunications	3835	B
uh-huh always it it's so funny you know his job is so complicated that i	3835	B
to me it's complicated that i never can exactly describe this to anybody	3835	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
well um now back to Fried Green Tomatoes you be sure and see that movie	3835	B
we saw it last Saturday and it was wonderful	3835	B
oh it really was	3835	B
uh-huh well it's either one	3835	B
yeah uh-huh it it has it's a story that would appeal to both men and women uh Dave liked it a lot huh	3835	B
oh no now but my husband liked Steel Magnolias but it was more like this is more like Driving Miss Daisy did you see that and um and this probably is even a little more	3835	B
masculine than than Driving Miss Daisy even but it's that kind of movie that has just a universal appeal	3835	B
uh-huh	3835	B
well how you doing	3835	A
um i from um Plano Texas where how about you	3835	A
oh okay	3835	A
pardon	3835	A
no um i i work for TI	3835	A
so that's how	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
well are you are you having a Super Bowl party	3835	A
well i was thinking now that would be a good place to exchange a recipe maybe um	3835	A
no i didn't uh uh it's probably in reference to the movie i'm sure	3835	A
um i know my husband has heard about that and thought that that sounded really good are they i don't even i've never had fried tomatoes	3835	A
huh	3835	A
i didn't know about it either now we i have had um marinated green tomatoes you know where you marinate them with onions and cucumbers but i don't i've never had fried	3835	A
fried green ones	3835	A
oh really	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
are they pretty does it look like it's a pretty easy thing to make	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
now i did i did go to a dinner this past weekend that was um	3835	A
at our church we had a church auction last fall and a lot of the things that were auctioned off were um services like a dinner for eight and then if you bought if you bought it	3835	A
there were two couples that two or three couples that might cater the dinner	3835	A
and one couple in our church had lived in the Philippines um years oh eight years ago and so they um auctioned off a Filipino dinner	3835	A
and um so it was really fun one of the things that we had were was fried um bananas but but not fried bananas i don't know what they're called but it's a it's kind of looks like	3835	A
the dough that they use for egg rolls	3835	A
i don't know what it's called but	3835	A
they put bananas in there and with cinnamon and i don't know what else and sugar and stuff and then they deep fry it	3835	A
and they use green bananas you know so that the bananas kind of stay together and i have fixed fried bananas before	3835	A
as a um Cuban or Spanish dish	3835	A
you know and they're really really good	3835	A
but um when you were talking about fried tomatoes it reminded me of this the fried bananas that	3835	A
you know	3835	A
yeah it was really a fun a fun thing to do a fun way to raise money	3835	A
i'm up at Spring Creek	3835	A
uh-huh	3835	A
um manufacturing	3835	A
oh really huh	3835	A
okay okay so he's in a different group	3835	A
yeah yeah i never can either i i mean i never can describe mine to my family or anything try to um i try to talk real real basic level when i get down to them	3835	A
okay	3835	A
was it	3835	A
is it a girl movie i mean is it is it something my husband would enjoy	3835	A
because he doesn't like going to see girly movies like like um Steel Magnolias he didn't want you know	3835	A
yeah yeah yeah	3835	A
okay	3835	A
yeah i mean like i have to rent Beaches and you know some of those other movies	3835	A
go ahead	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
do you have profit sharing	3851	A
right	3851	A
well that's nice	3851	A
yeah my company has that too	3851	A
uh medical	3851	A
i work for a private laboratory	3851	A
yeah we were smaller and it it was it was a lot better the benefits were a lot better and then we bought out another lab and	3851	A
uh they kind of cut the benefits a little bit	3851	A
right	3851	A
right	3851	A
well that's not bad	3851	A
how	3851	A
oh really lowered it to what	3851	A
yeah	3851	A
to what's your deductible	3851	A
that's that's good	3851	A
right that's that's that's better than most though	3851	A
i	3851	A
right	3851	A
well that can help a company a lot you know if they if they're in the in the past have been giving a lot of benefits if they cut them just a little bit that'll help	3851	A
and then i think some employees will tolerate that instead of lowering their salaries	3851	A
yeah i would	3851	A
yeah i know they uh they raised our deductible from two hundred to four hundred	3851	A
a person	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
yeah it is but that's something i can live with you know if that's if that's what they want to stop at	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
right	3851	A
oh wow	3851	A
right	3851	A
no huh-uh we sure don't	3851	A
well they're they're pretty big around here too	3851	A
and you know the larger companies have the HMOs	3851	A
whereas the smaller companies don't	3851	A
i know our our company underwrites our own insurance	3851	A
which in a way i think it it could be a little bad but	3851	A
so far it's working out okay	3851	A
what H HMO are you with	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
oh that's not bad	3851	A
and you have a retirement program and all that	3851	A
a retirement program and all that	3851	A
right	3851	A
yeah i've heard of that 401K used as a retirement program before	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
right	3851	A
can you contribute to that 401K	3851	A
uh-huh	3851	A
all right well i as i say i work for a telecommunications company in Plano	3851	B
and uh i really can't complain about the benefits i think they're they're pretty up-to-date and pretty comprehensive uh	3851	B
uh yes they have a thrift plan and profit sharing and uh the the routine things the medical coverage and dental and	3851	B
uh hearing coverage and so forth	3851	B
stock purchase plan and that sort of thing	3851	B
yeah it's uh they're pretty good uh pretty good program pretty good benefits	3851	B
and uh	3851	B
there's a uh in the thrift plan you can make a choice of a program that you can have your contributions directed to it's not just uh for the purchase of the company's stock it	3851	B
they have three or four different options available for you so it's uh and the vacation	3851	B
what kind of what industry you in	3851	B
oh i see	3851	B
oh okay	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
um	3851	B
um there's a lot of that going on because of the economy and so forth the medical programs have been cut back and	3851	B
we've had to uh i guess up to a year ago the coverage for the employee medical coverage was free but they they charge i think five dollars a month now and they they've	3851	B
no it's you can't complain about that and they've raised deductible or lowered lowered the deductible	3851	B
wait a minute now they raised the deductible they raised the deductible	3851	B
i think it's uh oh it's two hundred per person five hundred for for the family two hundred per covered	3851	B
uh it's it's been better but they have as i said they've raised it here in the last year or two	3851	B
but again i can't i really can't complain about that the vacation plan is pretty good	3851	B
uh there are eleven holidays a year it's it's again it's a competitive program pretty standard	3851	B
yeah well as i said and as you know they're they're cutting back in a lot of areas and uh	3851	B
not just laying off but uh cutting salaries and cutting back in the benefits area as well so	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
oh yeah that's for sure	3851	B
or being laid off but	3851	B
um per	3851	B
for the for the employee	3851	B
yeah that's pretty steep	3851	B
they have a flexible spending account up here where you can contribute a certain amount every month to this flexible spending plan- spending plan and use that money to uh pay your medical uh costs out of	3851	B
and there's there's a lot of interest in that of course if you put in too much money you have to have a pretty good idea as to what your medical expenses are going to be for the year	3851	B
because if you put in too much and you you don't use it all you don't get it back	3851	B
you lose it but uh there's quite a bit of interest in that	3851	B
we have an HMO as well as the uh standard group program	3851	B
do you have an HMO down at your place	3851	B
yeah i don't think there's as much interest in that up here in the HMO as the regular	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
right	3851	B
oh okay	3851	B
uh-huh	3851	B
yeah	3851	B
well	3851	B
oh it's uh	3851	B
it's Cigna i think we uh	3851	B
Cigna is the uh one that they're using	3851	B
and we have Aetna Aetna underwrites- underwrites not underwrites but it Aetna administers our medical program we're self-insured but Aetna is used to administer the program but Cigna Cigna is the uh HMO they use	3851	B
no it's it's pretty good it's pretty good coverage	3851	B
a what	3851	B
oh	3851	B
well it's uh no they don't they really they don't have- that's one thing they don't have- i guess i could say they really do need to uh	3851	B
uh get or acquire they they think that the 401K could be used as a as a retirement plan i guess that's what some people are doing	3851	B
but there's no retirement plan at all	3851	B
in fact they're using a company down there in Austin 401K management company to administer the program- it switched to them over the well last month	3851	B
but uh they made a nice presentation so the company decided to go with them but that's one thing they could use as a retirement plan unless you do unless you are committed to using your 401K as a as a retirement program	3851	B
but they don't have any kind of retirement plan	3851	B
oh yes yeah and they do too they match it up to a certain percent you can contribute up to fifteen percent depending on your salary	3851	B
and then uh	3851	B
tell me what's the last movie you saw	3880	A
Hook	3880	A
oh yeah there seems to be a lot out especially around Christmas but we were	3880	A
kind of busy and didn't really get out to see any of them_1	3880	A
uh the last one i went to the theater to see was uh The Doctors	3880	A
and i thought that was real good	3880	A
but i rent movies all the time	3880	A
yeah the last- the one that that seems to be the way we do it any more i saw Dying Young over the weekend	3880	A
and last week	3880	A
uh what's her name Julia Roberts	3880	A
and uh it was just really good	3880	A
i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying	3880	A
but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it	3880	A
yeah trying to	3880	A
i have been putting off to go see that one but my wife wants to see it too	3880	A
it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
oh yeah i	3880	A
yeah i went uh i went to the theater to see that one and then i rented it i think when it came out too	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
sometimes you're right it doesn't uh	3880	A
but it beats watching what ever is on television	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
we had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the Godfather movies	3880	A
so we did that	3880	A
and	3880	A
it was uh you know like fourteen hours of Godfather stuff	3880	A
no it took us about three days but	3880	A
yeah well it was still lots i'm telling you when that that the last hour you know number three	3880	A
we felt like we were Italians we were eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop	3880	A
there's three	3880	A
yeah it's almost something around fourteen hours	3880	A
uh but my- i think my favorite though are old movies black and white	3880	A
uh	3880	A
i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that	3880	A
it's just i don't know there's just something about them_1 i think it reminds me of my childhood	3880	A
not i just remember you know when i was little in the summer we got to stay up all night and that's what was on	3880	A
so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
i watched uh Doris Day Retrospective on uh CBS the other night just	3880	A
i thing about her and different movies she'd been in and i realized how much i missed the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies	3880	A
they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater	3880	A
and because they were like fantasy and and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere i'll want to watch it so	3880	A
yeah i am still here yes	3880	A
yeah i was just kind of	3880	A
i am in a rest area and i was just kind of looking somebody went by there i	3880	A
yeah uh to Tennessee it's my mother's eighty fifth birthday	3880	A
uh Kingsport	3880	A
you know where that is	3880	A
oh yeah are they still there	3880	A
yeah	3880	A
yeah i remember back when they first open in the early seventies there i worked at Univac and uh just down the road and boy all the everybody just	3880	A
the last movie i saw in a theater was Hook	3880	B
and uh it was very enjoyable um	3880	B
i'm trying to think there's a lot of movies i want to see	3880	B
but it but what the last one you saw	3880	B
hum	3880	B
yeah we do too	3880	B
is that good that's with um i'm trying to think who's in that	3880	B
oh okay okay	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
um we want to go see JFK	3880	B
i mean i've heard lots of reviews and stuff but i still want to see it just to	3880	B
and uh	3880	B
yeah it is and Plano has grown so much that	3880	B
um you know the restaurants and stuff are all so crowded now you use to be able to get out to get a quick bit to eat and go see a movie and it's just not that way any more	3880	B
so we usually stay in on Friday nights and rent movies and i think probably the last rented movie i saw	3880	B
well no i take that back it wasn't rented i think it was just on HBO at my in-laws house or something but it was Hunt for Red October	3880	B
and i love that movie	3880	B
yeah oh that would've been a good one	3880	B
that would've been a good one to see	3880	B
yeah but renting them_1 just doesn't do them_1 justice sometimes	3880	B
yeah that's true i mean i think like uh Dances with Wolves just	3880	B
you know would be a good movie on television but it you know the scenery and everything was so beautiful on the screen	3880	B
oh really	3880	B
all of them did you	3880	B
oh wow in one night	3880	B
okay i was going to say that's a long movie	3880	B
how many are there	3880	B
three okay	3880	B
well that's not as bad as as uh Friday the 13th or Planet of the Apes or	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
really	3880	B
um-hum um-hum	3880	B
we went through a stage where we rented a lot of the um Alfred Hitchcock	3880	B
the you know the like North by Northwest and Rear Window and all those and those are really good i mean you know the old black and whites and	3880	B
yeah oh yeah	3880	B
hum	3880	B
um-hum	3880	B
yeah	3880	B
oh they're those are some movies	3880	B
and they come on uh every now and then	3880	B
are you still there	3880	B
okay it got real quiet i didn't know	3880	B
there was no static or anything i thought no	3880	B
i thought i'd lost you	3880	B
so you are headed up to Tennessee	3880	B
where about	3880	B
oh okay that's right yeah um i work for TI and i've traveled up to Johnson City before and i	3880	B
um most of it was sold off to Simon's but there is still about five hundred employees that work that are TI	3880	B
oh	3880	B
well have you taken any vacations that you enjoyed lately	3837	A
okay so you went up like the Coast Highway for a way and then then went inland there	3837	A
is is that uh was that a new area for you to visit	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
it's the	3837	A
it's scenic i guess i i've i've been to a part of that on a trip to San Francisco i i went up just a short ways up the coast to i believe it was Point Raid	3837	A
uh National Seashore i think it was	3837	A
and and i only had about a day so it was just a short drive up from San Francisco and back when i was out out for business	3837	A
uh the the Redwood forest there	3837	A
what part of the country are you from	3837	A
are you currently living in Texas	3837	A
okay i- i'm in Texas too but	3837	A
in Richardson	3837	A
that's right	3837	A
well we uh my family and i moved here about three years ago we lived in Colorado and	3837	A
uh and and that's a good vacation spot too but it was nice living there	3837	A
yes i i didn't live too far from there in fact i bicycled from my house to there a time or two uh	3837	A
uh from Boulder i lived in Boulder Colorado	3837	A
uh i i uh didn't probably take advantage of it as much as i probably would if i moved back you kind of take it for granted when you live there but	3837	A
i did enjoy the skiing and and the and the winter sports that that was available there	3837	A
yeah it's enjoyable if you if you do it more than once or twice so you get past the learning stage so you can start enjoying it it's a little bit frustrating when you're falling a lot but after after you get past that it's a lot of fun	3837	A
well it sometimes can be yeah it it uh	3837	A
you can get some nice days skiing as well though if you're if you're not falling you can stay pretty dry and	3837	A
and uh it it can be pretty nice the dry climate doesn't feel near as cold as as it does here in the winter time to me	3837	A
yeah	3837	A
it's the the other extreme	3837	A
yeah it's i i agree with you it's sort of in between yeah after having lived in Colorado a lot that was a little dryer than was probably comfortable it's it's a bit little too dry and	3837	A
and this is actually a pretty good climate humidity wise in in the Dallas area	3837	A
last uh uh summer we uh we went uh and took the family to uh Cancun in Mexico and uh we really enjoyed that trip	3837	A
well it's pretty built up now	3837	A
yeah it probably was more enjoyable when you went before it was too too built it's it's a real strip hotel strip now out out on that island	3837	A
uh yes we we took a sailboat uh catamaran ride over to Isle Mujeres and they took us around let us shop a little while and then took us to some snorkeling uh	3837	A
spot	3837	A
yes took one in October and uh drove- uh flew into Los Angeles and drove up the coast	3837	B
to uh through Monterey and San Francisco and over to Lake Tahoe and flew out of Reno	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
uh-huh was really great	3837	B
most of it was because_1 i had uh seen parts of northern California and i'd been to San Francisco but never along the Coast Road	3837	B
it was quite exciting	3837	B
my husband said he didn't know whether he wanted to ever drive it again though	3837	B
have you been	3837	B
um i don't remember that	3837	B
oh	3837	B
well we went uh we liked Monterey very much and uh it was just kind of a relaxed pleasant town with a lot of things to see and do and	3837	B
and then uh the Muir Woods on the other side of San Francisco um that's another really bad drive but it's it's worth going to too	3837	B
yes	3837	B
originally from Texas i was raised up in Dalhart	3837	B
so uh anything that doesn't look like flat plains is uh like i told someone once i always thought Dallas was real green	3837	B
because it was the greenest place i'd ever been	3837	B
oh yes live in Dallas	3837	B
where are you from- where do you live	3837	B
okay well you're just a a suburb of Dallas	3837	B
oh	3837	B
oh my	3837	B
yes yes	3837	B
well we uh when our children were young we used to go to Estes Park	3837	B
oh	3837	B
well how fortunate you were	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
that's that is one beautiful place	3837	B
no	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
um	3837	B
well i've never skied my husband keeps saying we need to go but uh we have never done it yet but uh everyone who does says it's great	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
you have to enjoy the cold snow in your face huh	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
well i think that uh no the dampness course our humidity is sort of medium compared uh well where i was raised is extremely dry	3837	B
but my brother lives in Houston and	3837	B
yeah so we're kind of in-between but uh my mother always said that Dallas was extremely humid to her	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
have you gone on any vacations lately	3837	B
oh yeah	3837	B
have they uh uh we were we were there when it one of the first times it was open they were just building the hotels and	3837	B
i was afraid it had become so commercialized	3837	B
uh-huh	3837	B
did you go over to the Isle Mujeres	3837	B
um	3837	B
yeah	3837	B
oh did you get to go out to that reef	3837	B
yes sir	3839	A
well uh you mean that i did or had done	3839	A
either one well actually um this whole past summer i've had my old outside of my house repainted	3839	A
and a lot of the little minor wood things corrected	3839	A
and just prior to that i had a a bathroom totally remodeled and rebuilt and uh so i've i'm bringing my house up-to-date really	3839	A
we built the house in nineteen sixty	3839	A
no	3839	A
that's right they they- they do change and and the bathrooms you know if you have any water leakage anywhere can uh slowly deteriorate things and so you got to plug those leaks up	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
is that right well- is the water level high there	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
oh well we just got about a an inch inch and a half last night	3839	A
oh i see	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
oh i see are you doing this yourself	3839	A
i declare oh well	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
uh-huh	3839	A
that's true these lot of fellows uh uh really- really want to work pretty hard so they willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices i'm sure of that i just had some guttering also replaced on my home	3839	A
uh i actually replaced all the other guttering last year and and the piece that i did this year seemed all right at the time so i left it alone	3839	A
that's what i put up this last time it's one solid piece about thirty feet long	3839	A
no it was uh brought out on a truck	3839	A
so i i- it was it- i have seen these things done they uh they come on great big large wheels i think of material and they roll it off	3839	A
yeah	3839	A
well this as i say this was already uh they had come out and measured it and brought out the two pieces at the correct length and all they had to do is mount them and then uh seal one joint where the two ends came together	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
um-hum	3839	A
uh-huh	3839	A
worked all right huh	3839	A
that's very very close i	3839	A
as they say down south you done good	3839	A
yeah	3839	A
well that sounds great	3839	A
yeah well i've got this uh the we were talking earlier about my house i've got one more bathroom to rebuild and uh	3839	A
we also have a a a porch that extends out from our master bedroom that we want to rebuild it's uh taken a beating over the years and um now we're a little afraid to walk out on it because some of the wood is deteriorating	3839	A
uh we're in between the mountains we're we're in uh what we're called Nitny Valley at Penn State i	3839	A
hey Larry what is the last home repair job you did	3839	B
had the either one	3839	B
um-hum you-	3839	B
how old is your house	3839	B
well that's not that old of a house but things do change from time to time don't they	3839	B
y'all have basements in Pennsylvania don't you	3839	B
we don't have basements in Texas unless it's an unusual- a very unusual situation	3839	B
uh no we build them_1 on pier and beams as they- up for few years back and then what's popular now is just called a slab	3839	B
and we don't have snow to speak of	3839	B
if it snows in Dallas we won't- we don't go to work and wait for it to melt and at lunch we have the day off you know it i'm serious we just we don't have any snow plows	3839	B
uh the last home project i guess well a year and a half ago we bought a house that had laid vacant for about two years and had been	3839	B
well sad situation estate thing and we've kind of put the whole thing back together uh the biggest thing i did was uh refenced and redecked in the back	3839	B
are you kidding	3839	B
i'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a hammer and a nail it wouldn't be straight anyway	3839	B
uh	3839	B
let's see and we- we found a part time fireman and policeman and in their so- so called spare time they moonlight	3839	B
and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow page advertised uh	3839	B
personnel	3839	B
um-hum	3839	B
have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now	3839	B
no kidding	3839	B
were you were you happy- did they make it right there on your property	3839	B
oh okay	3839	B
i haven't seen it done when we moved into the uh the house we	3839	B
we got guttering bids we finally repaired briefly what we've got for less than a hundred bucks those guys were gonna sell me a three thousand	3839	B
go ahead and uh they talked about bringing a machine out and just making it right there in the front yard and putting it up as they make it so i've never seen one	3839	B
i just thought of a project i did my wife wanted an island in the kitchen	3839	B
well we the house isn't that new so i built a uh	3839	B
a uh	3839	B
a table	3839	B
from the local hardware store we have a outfit called Home Depot which is probably local down here but i ordered a Formica top with rounded corners	3839	B
and then they have premade and bevelled uh legs and braces and so i simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces and and uh put it together and uh	3839	B
for and it worked just fine it was premeasured- the legs were premeasured exactly the same length so it's level hold it i have to put two business cards underneath it that's pretty damn close for an amateur	3839	B
uh	3839	B
yeah had somebody come through and he said my gosh if you had bought that at a store it'd been seven hundred and fifty dollars and i got out for about a hundred and forty five i think	3839	B
so i was happy	3839	B
um-hum	3839	B
how nice	3839	B
are y'all in the mountains	3839	B
yes sir	3898	B
well there is two kinds one i guess i'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh	3898	B
oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant uh you know something nice	3898	B
and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy	3898	B
uh recently we've been hitting Pancho's up it's a local Mexican restaurant pretty heavily because they've got a good rate on the you know good prices and everything	3898	B
yeah yeah it's it's a chain down here- uh it goes up into Colorado and down here i don't know where else it is what about you	3898	B
oh yeah	3898	B
i think think it might be i've seen- i think i've seen it around yes sir yeah	3898	B
oh do you yeah	3898	B
oh we we do too we uh we enjoy Mexican food i'm just not impressed with the quality of it it's just primarily the price that's uh	3898	B
satisfying at this point but the kids seem to enjoy it um	3898	B
and uh let's see we've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here but it's uh	3898	B
not part of a chain it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant but the first one we've been to that	3898	B
uh i don't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had that was uh not just really super it's nice to find a place like that	3898	B
you know yeah	3898	B
um	3898	B
oh boy have you ever been to uh what is it Original Book Binders in Philadelphia	3898	B
uh that's an old established uh restaurant i used to go there when i was in college	3898	B
i went to the Naval Academy and we used to we used to go up there on uh for football games sometimes	3898	B
and have some liberty and yeah we'd go over there to uh pretty sure it was original Original Book Binders i think it was yes	3898	B
i haven't been back there in years	3898	B
okay what area	3898	B
is that right did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando Florida	3898	B
yes sir my dad worked there for years and years that's where- that's uh that's where i grew up was down in Orlando so	3898	B
that's uh that's interesting well i was in submarines uh	3898	B
okay yeah must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there when- when did you retire	3898	B
well great i'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics	3898	B
yeah	3898	B
okay right first	3898	B
oh we we do enjoy that yes sir uh i don't know if we're particularly adventurous we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh	3898	B
at a particular restaurant and then we usually stick by it but do you what about you	3898	B
hot um-hum	3898	B
um where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking	3898	B
um-hum	3898	B
uh-huh what's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food	3898	B
i guess one of the things we've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that but we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh seafood- you know even uh shrimp uh	3898	B
dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant	3898	B
okay thanks for that uh reference	3898	B
-okay good yeah	3898	B
okay Gene so it's nice to talk with you and um food is a very intriguing thing our lives are are built around foods that we like and and nutritionally good for us what kind of dining out do you like	3898	A
oh	3898	A
yeah	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
Pancho that's a new one um-hum	3898	A

and uh we had a restaurant called La Bamba but it's just it closed recently but Chi-Chi's is a national restaurant i think isn't it Mexican do you have it there	3898	A
uh-huh well i love Mexican food myself	3898	A
but you go ahead now	3898	A
is that right	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
oh boy that is wonderful well i- i agree with you on that and i was- was really a seafood addict myself i- i love crab meat in particular	3898	A
i uh i can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if had to	3898	A
i know the name but i haven't been there	3898	A
uh-huh where did you go to college	3898	A
oh the Naval Academy	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
i'll be darn	3898	A
well we're we're supposed to be talking about dining out but i'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from Penn State	3898	A
and uh all my work has been in research for the Navy	3898	A
underwater acoustics	3898	A
i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has	3898	A
um-hum	3898	A
oh you grew up in Orlando uh-huh	3898	A
well that's what i worked on	3898	A
uh end of last month	3898	A
i certainly have	3898	A
so what- i hate to uh i wish i could talk to you about that uh but uh i guess we should continue on uh	3898	A
okay how do you like Chinese food	3898	A
uh-huh	3898	A
well i uh enjoy the Szechuan type of uh Chinese food	3898	A
yes yep um it's it's i i do a lot of Chinese cooking myself i have in the past i haven't done it recently but uh it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like that are just really delicious meals	3898	A
um just at home	3898	A
i- i enjoyed the food and i bought a lot of uh	3898	A
good cookbooks and i've been following through on that when you find the right cookbook why it works out	3898	A
okay well that one's a good question here it's right under my nose if i can find it	3898	A
oh boy	3898	A
yeah right	3898	A
one of the the this book i have is called Chinese Cooking Made Easy	3898	A
um	3898	A
it's a paperback and i think it's by someone named Chang yeah Isabelle Chang	3898	A

yeah great have you done much uh much in the way of home repairs	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
great how old a house do you have	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah yeah great	3829	A
oh well right now we're not we're living in a travel trailer but uh we've we we've just moved here to Dallas uh recently and we're living in that until we can find a place but	3829	A
uh we lived in a brick homes in uh in Louisiana before this and did some uh various kinds of things uh made some storm windows to put up and	3829	A
uh	3829	A
uh really did a major {rejob} on the inside of the house uh put up some walls and uh put in a bathroom and stuff like that	3829	A
uh	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
wow that's pretty good yeah	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
um-hum do you think it was worth uh the ceiling fans on your resale	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
sure well sounds good you think you'll do it again some time	3829	A
hum	3829	A
is that right yeah	3829	A
oh it sounds like you've got a good bit of experience in that	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
sure we're thinking about possibly building a house now we aren't real sure whether we're gonna be able to do that or not but we just talked to a builder today as a matter of fact	3829	A
you know just uh beginning to think about sketching out some plans and talked about some of the different uh	3829	A
ways to go on you know different things	3829	A
yeah it sounds like you're uh really into uh remodeling what you get	3829	A
yeah	3829	A
okay	3829	A
um-hum	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
um-hum how far away from Austin is it	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
oh yeah	3829	A
ever are you um	3829	A
looking to get	3829	A
uh well since Christmas we painted a bedroom and did some wallpapering in there i had to do most of it since uh my wife was working	3829	B
uh Austin yeah and getting- getting ready around here to do some uh major yard work as soon as the weather turns a little bit nicer	3829	B
yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but i figure i'd just be wasting my time	3829	B
uh i've always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that except maybe i don't do heaters and air conditioners but	3829	B
i usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and things	3829	B
uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh it's kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it we've only we only moved here about a year ago	3829	B
what about you what kind of house you live in	3829	B
about two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville which is like forty miles east of Austin over toward Houston uh little old stucco house built in nineteen twenty one and uh	3829	B
we bought it to- for- to get- for a weekend getaway	3829	B
and it needed a lot of work but we saw it when we first looked at it we can do this and uh sure enough uh it's oh nineteen months later we sold it for twenty six and we bought it for sixteen five	3829	B
and we did things like paint uh inside and outside and basically repaired the garages we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my part but	3829	B
it was something i thought the place needed because_1 it had real high ceilings and uh just and just in general did everything we uh put in a hot water heater a new toilet and things like that kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets	3829	B
well we weren't think- talking about reselling it when we started doing it we were looking for something to do on weekends	3829	B
and it because_1 my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment and if it doesn't work try another color things like that	3829	B
so but when the offer came to us it was from a neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them_1 and we thought well you know we're not we hadn't been out here but what once in three months and	3829	B
and we had just bought this house in Austin so we thought well what the heck let's make a little money on it	3829	B
yeah i'd like to uh	3829	B
we have bought new homes in the past and and we'll never do that again because it was just boring for- after about a week	3829	B
yeah so	3829	B
uh out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down oh terribly run down home and uh it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make almost forty five thousand in profit on it	3829	B
and that was just	3829	B
yeah uh it's just we you know we map out what we want to do and we go for it uh	3829	B
whoever's got time to do it and course you get the major things done like your you know have the floors redone or have carpet put in whatever but the rest of it we usually do ourselves	3829	B
yeah i uh i think about that from time to time because_1 we've never actually you know built one that we wanted you know the way we wanted it and things like that but	3829	B
i'm not sure that our interest is that piqued in it to do something like that	3829	B
yeah renovation- renovation is kind of where we're at like our our favorite TV program is This Old House has been for many years	3829	B
and we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it uh	3829	B
there again we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home and because they're so it's a town that time has passed by so there are a lot of old big homes and they're fairly inexpensive	3829	B
so	3829	B
it's forty miles uh it's on the it's on the river and it's a quite nice little town they've been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things i mean there's no KMarts or anything like that around so	3829	B
makes it kind of nice	3829	B
so what are your favorite shows	3850	B
oh really	3850	B
Quantum Leap	3850	B
did you see it the other night-	3850	B
that was a that was pretty good	3850	B
when he with the psychic and everything	3850	B
okay	3850	B
yeah i like uh	3850	B
i like	3850	B
Northern Exposure and uh Home Improvement	3850	B
you've never seen Northern Exposure	3850	B
oh it's a great show	3850	B
really yeah we like it too	3850	B
have you seen the movie	3850	B
oh you haven't seen any of them_1	3850	B
oh well they're good	3850	B
they're real good	3850	B
they're uh	3850	B
they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though	3850	B
which ones are you watching the new ones	3850	B
oh okay	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
well they're	3850	B
they're a lot different but i like i like the older ones because_1 at that time you know they were really	3850	B
futuristic you know	3850	B
and	3850	B
the newer ones are	3850	B
i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too but i like i like both of them_1	3850	B
really	3850	B
no it's	3850	B
not really	3850	B
it's not really like a soap opera but	3850	B
but it's	3850	B
but that's true i mean you you learn more about the the characters and stuff but that's the way all shows are now	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
well the it seems they always show Colombo the same ones over and over though	3850	B
you know what i'm saying like that one where he goes to college	3850	B
or those is there a series on	3850	B
okay	3850	B
yeah i saw that one see that was a rerun	3850	B
yeah i'm wondering if that's	3850	B
see i don't know if that's the the	3850	B
movie of the week or	3850	B
or what but it seems like there's only about	3850	B
four or five different ones and then and they keep showing them_1 over and over	3850	B
he was a movie director and he had that gal killed	3850	B
okay	3850	B
that was pretty good though	3850	B
um-hum	3850	B
no kidding	3850	B
what is it that there's something i watch	3850	B
something i watch on Saturdays and i can't remember what it is	3850	B
now i used to watch Twin Peaks	3850	B
you never saw that	3850	B
yeah yeah that was a definite soap opera	3850	B
but it was it was a different type of show	3850	B
i didn't like the way it ended though	3850	B
yeah	3850	B
yeah they didn't they only did it for i think two years	3850	B
but it's all over now	3850	B
okay_1	3850	A
um i like watching Colombo and um Matlock and	3850	A
Quantum Leap yeah	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
um uh-huh	3850	A
yeah that one was what is that	3850	A
uh-huh yeah	3850	A
oh i well i haven't seen either of those	3850	A
huh-uh	3850	A
um	3850	A
i also like to watch Star Trek but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it	3850	A
uh i haven't seen any of the movies because_1 i just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it and they're you know already out with number six by now but	3850	A
so i haven't seen any of the movies yet but i	3850	A
no	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
yeah i've seen uh quite a few of the older ones i haven't seen really the new generation that much	3850	A
is there one you prefer better the older one or the younger- the newer one	3850	A
oh yeah	3850	A
yeah i do too i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones	3850	A
a lot i mean he almost hates the new ones yeah because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but	3850	A
whatever	3850	A
oh i think yeah	3850	A
yeah sure	3850	A
well let's see	3850	A
um	3850	A
i like to watch Colombo because it's like a mystery thing	3850	A
and that's sort of how Matlock is but Colombo is	3850	A
uh did you see the one	3850	A
um did-	3850	A
um yeah there's like one on well we see it Thursdays at seven	3850	A
and	3850	A
it was this last time it was about this um movie director	3850	A
did you happen- did you see that one	3850	A
really oh i guess i've never-	3850	A
huh	3850	A
oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before	3850	A
yeah	3850	A
yeah on the set or something	3850	A
yeah it was	3850	A
but i yeah i like Colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things	3850	A
but um there's no never anything good on Saturdays though	3850	A
i don't think so well Star Trek's on at five but i'm never home	3850	A
so	3850	A
oh	3850	A
i've heard of it a lot i've heard of a lot of	3850	A
people somehow or something they'll say so and so from Twin Peaks or something you know	3850	A
oh	3850	A
uh-huh	3850	A
oh did they end the whole series	3850	A
oh	3850	A
oh	3850	A
oh another show i like to watch is MASH	3850	A
uh it was about the Vietnam right	3879	A
yeah well uh	3879	A
guess uh i'm twenty three are you older than i am	3879	A
so you probably have a better -opinion of of what	3879	A
huh	3879	A
right	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
um	3879	A
yeah	3879	A
yeah i mean looking back now know what we know now i mean it was just a complete disaster	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
yeah i just think	3879	A
that the Gulf War was just something that was really	3879	A
um	3879	A
i know it's i kind of look at it as a little bit of propaganda in a way because i mean we- basically- went in and spent i don't know how many billions of dollars and	3879	A
just beat up on a	3879	A
inferior yeah inferior army that was just wanting- wanting to quit and didn't have any food and i mean it's just i don't know how much pride one can really take in that and	3879	A
um-hum	3879	A
oh yeah that's just um	3879	A
i've seen uh you know Apocalypse Now and um	3879	A
uh what was the one with um Christopher Waken and um	3879	A
The Deer Hunter yeah i've you know and the just a lot of other i guess inferior ones made but i mean as far i think Apocalypse Now and um Deer Hunter were just	3879	A
just incredible movies you know Deer Hunter's a little bit more of a incident but	3879	A
yeah Heart of Darkness yeah i've seen that that was uh it's great they had it on Showtime um before they released it to theaters fact	3879	A
around the summer and uh it's really something it's almost it it's just as entertaining if not more entertaining than a film is because_1 it's	3879	A
right she just shot documentary you know had like a little hand held camera and you know the whole thing's been edited together but when Martin Sheen had his heart attack it's just amazing what you know Frances is just	3879	A
it it doesn't capture the actual event it captures him getting uh some treatment after it happened but she had a tape reporter running when he was talking on the phone about it and	3879	A
he's just literally freaking out i mean about he's more concerned about the you know how because_1 he's as the whole time i guess when it was being made um i was just a kid back then but i guess it's just	3879	A
the people back in America just were hearing about it how it was just such a disaster this is like the last thing he need is is for Marty to have a heart attack i mean you'll you'll love it i mean it's it's really great um	3879	A
the Vietnam War	3879	B
yeah i'm forty one so i would uh	3879	B
well i uh was in college when the war escalated to it's height and uh	3879	B
i guess my feeling is consistent with that of uh the general public that it was unfortunate	3879	B
event uh	3879	B
it's real interesting to think about it in the context of this new movie JFK which is	3879	B
apparently linking the Kennedy assassination to his decision to his- uh uh the apparently people uh who worked for Kennedy say he didn't decide that he was going to	3879	B
pull out of Vietnam was not going to commit more troops that that had nothing to do with the assassination of those people say but they that he had come to that conclusion	3879	B
i think it was uh	3879	B
particularly in light of recent events a really unfortunate mistake Communism was self destructing even then and uh	3879	B
the history of Vietnam which has been uh represented in a number of different commentaries and documentaries one on the public broadcasting system	3879	B
uh it seems that it just didn't have to happen and i think uh its a valuable	3879	B
uh if painful lesson for this country	3879	B
right	3879	B
at the time i wasn't that uh	3879	B
wasn't that sure i- i- i really didn't know enough about it and wasn't that politically active uh	3879	B
but it was	3879	B
um	3879	B
apparently something that could've been avoided and i you know i- i look at wars generally as falling into that category um	3879	B
people are beginning to wonder whether or not the uh the Gulf War could've been avoided even though that was a remarkably painless war and as wars go	3879	B
right	3879	B
third world country really	3879	B
well i think what what's uh i- i guess i'd use the word relevant to the Vietnam War question is that the Vietnam War was apparently avoidable too it was a time when Ho Chi Minh	3879	B
apparently came to the United States and said look if you're willing to provide me with support all i wanna do is unify Vietnam	3879	B
and uh he was turned away by Truman um	3879	B
so it's	3879	B
hum	3879	B
a painful lesson i guess one that we're beginning to learn i'm really impressed by how much effect some of these movies have had on public consciousness the JFK movie's cause causing one person after another to	3879	B
call for the release of the documents that have been sealed	3879	B
did you see any of the Vietnam Wars um any of the Vietnam war movies	3879	B
oh the Deer Hunter	3879	B
yeah	3879	B
those two yep	3879	B
yeah they were they've	3879	B
yeah well they were both remarkable films as a matter of fact there's a new film out about the Vietnam War about the making of Apocalypse Now which itself is suppose to be a great yeah have you is it good	3879	B
that's what people say i'm really looking forward to seeing his wife apparently made it from- documentary	3879	B
oh is is that on film did- that- that get captured on film	3879	B
right right right	3879	B
yeah well i the thing i think is really neat about	3879	B
well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i side- i lean more towards the control side than than towards	3803	B
you know just the the free free arming um on the other hand i it's it's sort of an issue of of uh	3803	B
uh i'm not i'm not a great fan of of government control in general and so it's it's kind of a tough issue what about yourself	3803	B
um-hum	3803	B
i'm i'm sure yeah um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um	3803	B
specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that is that	3803	B
huh	3803	B
yeah i i have i- i have the impression that that the	3803	B
the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are- are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway	3803	B
um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents' gun or something and and	3803	B
shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's that's certainly within the channels right	3803	B
but um	3803	B
a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns	3803	B
uh-huh	3803	B
yeah	3803	B
uh-huh yeah i i mean i think uh some states- or i i i don't know if anybody actually has implemented i think so um at least there's been talk about doing uh	3803	B
you know like waiting periods and and things like that um and and uh	3803	B
you know i i think stuff like that is perfectly good i mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything strange- you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes	3803	B
waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem you know and and things i don't know i've	3803	B
you know i uh i don't own a gun and and don't really want one and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did um but on the other hand you	3803	B
know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general uh	3803	B
yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they're not gonna disappear anytime soon um and they're already	3803	B
i know there's a ready market for them_1 you know in the stolen- the stolen stolen guns can be sold i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun	3803	B
right because uh because they they can be so easily sold	3803	B
and you know their their i don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but um it's not like they're gonna disappear all of a sudden	3803	B
um even if you do do a total ban on them_1	3803	B
uh-huh it's a real tough problem	3803	B
i i don't know i don't know where i	3803	B
really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue i think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing right	3803	B
you know and	3803	B
uh-huh	3803	B
hm	3803	B
yeah well we you know we i grew up with them_1 i never really took to hunting i mean i did some of it but uh	3803	B
you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that	3803	B
and you know it was a whole different thing and and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses	3803	B
but it you know that's that seems to me just to be a whole another issue um you know the the thing that the i yeah i'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people	3803	B
hi what do you think about gun control	3803	A
well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or	3803	A
um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in DC come home very quickly	3803	A
well i'm not so sure about that but i think somehow uh safety courses	3803	A
or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people	3803	A
i'd like to know that the people who had them_1 at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them_1 or not you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better	3803	A
which is sort of you know flaky but still	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
yeah i don't know this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns	3803	A
and went up to New York and sold them_1 for you know very high markups now in a sense that's a legal	3803	A
way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
right	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
right and i suppose complete- uh you know complete- total ban would lead to more illegal weapons	3803	A
um-hum um-hum	3803	A
right	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
but that's true i mean some people grew up with guns in the house we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing	3803	A
and i'm not sure that's good either	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
um-hum	3803	A
well i think they ought to spend- uh i don't think they ought to spend overly spend on it but uh i don't see anything wrong with you know having a pretty good budget for it because uh	3816	B
heck i don't know i don't i think maybe one day they will uh find a good use for it you know maybe they haven't all that much yet uh other than the little things they've developed in this space shuttle	3816	B
the little experiments that they've done and so forth you know	3816	B
in uh i know they asked the question uh would you go if you had the chance and i'd go tomorrow	3816	B
if i had a chance	3816	B
yeah right	3816	B
well i don't know i just it would be something i've never experienced before weightlessness i'd love to experience weightlessness that's something i've always uh thought would be fascinating you know	3816	B
yeah	3816	B
yeah i think so	3816	B
when they had the uh accident you know back- the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i won't go you know but uh since then i thought well what the heck i'd go if it would be a one time- once in lifetime experience i'd try it	3816	B
no i don't think so	3816	B
uh it might it it very well may uh i think it's sort a	3816	B
had a setback because of that accident and uh and sometimes i get really disappointed because they have so many delays when they have a launch	3816	B
and everything i think gee you know they'll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch	3816	B
so i don't know you know they seems like they sort of bog down they're not really progressing right now to me	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
yeah	3816	B
yeah well i believe that uh they'll eventually make it to Mars you know maybe not in our lifetime but uh you know if this world is still here at that time i think they'll i think they'll eventually do that	3816	B
right	3816	B
is that right i didn't realize that	3816	B
uh-huh	3816	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3816	B
sure sure	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
yeah yeah	3816	B
yeah well that's true that's true and i guess they've got a lot of uh they've done a lot of medical tests	3816	B
uh in space too and uh i mean- i don't know what they've they've actually come up with	3816	B
but uh i know that medicine is another	3816	B
area that they used- that they've used in space a lot you know	3816	B
that's right	3816	B
right right	3816	B
is that no i don't even know about that	3816	B
oh yeah the the the ice	3816	B
right	3816	B
uh-huh	3816	B
right- to the weightlessness yeah	3816	B
i think- i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of	3816	B
sort of sitting still but i think eventually it will uh they'll it will come to them	3816	B
you know	3816	B
that's right well you know talking about the weightlessness i've uh i've uh noticed that they've talked about like these Russian astronauts that stay up there for nearly a year	3816	B
you know they have a lot of problems with the i'm not sure what it is with the the muscle muscle- tone and so forth because_1 they uh	3816	B
they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but it's not the same as exercising with gravity and the i i'm not sure exactly	3816	B
what the deal was but there were some problems with long term weightlessness	3816	B
yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess	3816	B
i- i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i- i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when- when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they walk- they couldn't walk very well	3816	B
when they finally made it back into gravity and uh i'm not sure exactly why that was you know i mean it was because of the weightlessness but i'm not sure physiologically what happened	3816	B
ready so what do you think do we spend too much on the space program or	3816	A
do you	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah we could	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
oh you're an adventurer huh	3816	A
what makes it what makes it so exciting for you	3816	A
yeah that that'd be fun that'd be a lot of fun	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
that's true yeah i'd i'd have to i'd think once or twice but i think i'd probably do it just for the experience i guess but it'd be pretty interesting that's for sure	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh yeah you couldn't- couldn't pass it up that's for sure	3816	A
you think it'll ever happen where they'll let it'll be common or	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
yeah that's true	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
yeah i'm i'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station they're talking about you know i think that'd be a step to where you know in the right direction but	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
yeah i'd uh just the way we progress i- i like i say i'd hate to see them_1 cut out the the budget there's a lot of places	3816	A
you know that can use it but just you know simple things like Teflon stuff like that all came from the Apollo mission yeah things they developed	3816	A
you know	3816	A
in that program you know i mean- mean- mean just common everyday things that we take for granted but	3816	A
you know that's as an offshoot it's kind of like the military budget you know there's a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military	3816	A
that we end up using just a you know everyday stuff but something like that Teflon something you take for granted you use it every day but	3816	A
if it hadn't of been for something like that you'd never you know really you may not have got it so	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
well they said yeah	3816	A
uh-huh they say in you know in weightlessness they're they're able to do a lot of different things with the chemicals and minerals that they can't do with the gravity so	3816	A
there could be some valuable- i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i	3816	A
yeah i think it's	3816	A
they've been a little concerned because it's kind of chilly it's cold you know like you say so they're a little worried about the	3816	A
same thing that happened to the Challenger but they are going up to do some tests with some organisms- uh organisms and stuff and weightlessness to see how they uh	3816	A
how they react to that and everything but so i think i think you're right though they're getting little better and better sooner- sooner- you know sooner or later they're going to make some major breakthroughs	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
yeah it's just a matter of time i guess nothing ever comes without- nothing ever comes without some effort so	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
oh really i hadn't heard that	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
huh	3816	A
so it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they started or	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
uh-huh	3816	A
oh really	3816	A
huh	3816	A
yeah	3816	A
card yourself or	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
yeah it's i work at a at a financial institution and seen quite a bit used to be a loan officer and	3800	A
seen people with you know they've had well i've seen a person with forty thousand dollars in limits and about twenty thousand dollars of it used and i and we we've got one but it's just for absolute emergencies we hardly ever use it	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
for sure	3800	A
yeah they uh they can like you say you can once you start using them they they're always real- real willing to raise those limits for you that's for sure	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
no they can afford to write off a lot more	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
that's excuse me yeah that's true i uh	3800	A
well i can't see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i can't imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because_1 there's-	3800	A
yeah well that make you- you know that makes sense i guess if they're they're not willing to write off as much but	3800	A
you know it there's a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we sent- we'll take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars cost- or a year for the just the fee and everything it	3800	A
i don't know i just i have a hard time i like i say i	3800	A
working in a financial institution i just i'm really rate conscious i guess and can't see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
yep there's i imagine there's there's quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they don't have to charge- you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that can't pay it off monthly and get	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
yeah that's true	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah i uh i- i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt they've got it just seems like they're	3800	A
they right now they can't afford to buy anymore because they're up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know that's part of the reason i think everything's kind of stalled out but	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
that exactly you know when that thing was they were trying to pass through- through- that through Congress they the thing that Congress didn't realize is that yeah they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and you know it would slow you know they were trying to	3800	A
pick things up but it would just it do wouldn't do any good because you know the banks aren't stupid they're going to realize that they can't you know they can't keep affording to write off five percent if they're only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
that's true	3800	A
that's true	3800	A
i don't know what will happen like i say we're sure trying we we just got the one and we just don't want to get any more	3800	A
no	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
yeah	3800	A
if it's not huh huh where do you work at	3800	A
oh do you	3800	A
um-hum	3800	A
um	3800	A
uh yeah	3800	A
turn in the voucher	3800	A
um	3800	A
uh yes uh uh not as much as i used to we used to have quite a few credit cards and over the the last few years we've tried to cut them back a little bit and and uh down to mainly- mainly one each uh	3800	B
uh it's it's easy to let them_1 get out of control	3800	B
oh	3800	B
yeah yeah that's uh that's what we try to to go to uh and eliminate all the uh uh department store uh credit cards uh got rid of all those	3800	B
yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they don't have to be as credit conscious they can	3800	B
yeah they can write off a lot more losses now	3800	B
uh which which i kind of disagree uh with i'd rather them_1 going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates	3800	B
yeah i i've heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
yeah	3800	B
well- yeah	3800	B
well well people- people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they don't look at at spending uh eighteen percent on on credit it's uh for some reason they don't look at it that way	3800	B
that	3800	B
that's that's true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them_1 off but there's	3800	B
sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them_1 off but	3800	B
but the people who who can't afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it it's sort of like the federal government	3800	B
yes that's right	3800	B
well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh	3800	B
uh i think it would only mean that they'd they'd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and they'd probably make just as much money they just wouldn't write off as many losses	3800	B
yeah that's that's right	3800	B
yes uh	3800	B
well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didn't look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and that's in uh in real estate and other things and it's the same with credit cards	3800	B
yeah we i- i use a company one somewhat uh uh to- to uh	3800	B
do air travel and all but uh i make sure that one's always uh paid off because_1 i'm responsible for the interest on that one if if i don't pay it off uh uh	3800	B
i work for uh an oil company and they they issue a an American Express card so that you don't have to ask for uh expense advances when you have to travel and buy air tickets so	3800	B
so you just use your card but it's but it's in your name so it's up to you to pay it off and and because it's American Express you can't run up a a credit on it so that	3800	B
okay you're probably uh more up on this subject than i am but	3809	A
the roles that women have played the last couple- couple of year in our are couple of generations	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last	3809	A
oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling	3809	A
you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry uh	3809	A
there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five- five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and	3809	A
you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
you bet that's sort of neat	3809	A
sure i think uh it's the age- age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that	3809	A
you know women are paid less than men and they're and they're doing the same uh	3809	A
or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way	3809	A
and	3809	A
i think so hope so and-	3809	A
absolutely-	3809	A
you know i've	3809	A
right yeah they forget also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know	3809	A
if if a a woman Congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever	3809	A
so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way	3809	A
but i guess just the most significant thing- change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going	3809	A
and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good a good statement	3809	A
and i think if in the future it's even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant	3809	A
wow	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
good point	3809	A
right now i'm self employed and and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my business uh she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so	3809	A
you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business and she still works everyday so	3809	A
you bet	3809	A
uh-oh enjoying- enjoying it what kind of work do you do	3809	A
well good	3809	A
right married	3809	A
yeah	3809	A
well- well	3809	A
trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject	3809	A
you see the old uh	3809	A
cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way	3809	A
baby right and uh you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that and	3809	A
it's really true women have come a long way and you know	3809	A
that	3809	B
right well they've entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started	3809	B
and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah the you see more of that you see more of them_1 uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too	3809	B
you know i- i go to a i have a club that i belong to Altrusa that you know one of the girls travels quite extensively and she said well my children have two parents you know why not	3809	B
so that that's a i think that's a change and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing	3809	B
right	3809	B
no that that i think should change will change in the near future also it's been changing it's been evolving but there's still a an	3809	B
an inequality in the work force in certain jobs it's you know and you hear some people say you know well he's a man he he he needs that salary	3809	B
right	3809	B
and going yeah um-hum	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah i- i think it will be i think i well another- another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they're out there i guess is that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind	3809	B
um because in the past the male bought the cars but now they're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases	3809	B
and that they are looking for um	3809	B
different things in the car the man is looking for the engine- in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel	3809	B
uh can her makeup come off the upholstery and if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out there that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah we all do	3809	B
i'm just happen to be off today so i work too	3809	B
i'm a nurse	3809	B
and i work at Medical Treatment Center um which is at Garland- uh Jupiter and Arapaho	3809	B
no	3809	B
i don't know	3809	B
i'm kind of out of out of things	3809	B
you've come a long way baby	3809	B
right	3809	B
yeah	3869	A
um-hum um-hum	3869	A
uh well i agree with you there i feel that there's	3869	A
there's is a turning point ahead- still ahead of us we haven't gotten there yet	3869	A
excuse me but i do think that	3869	A
there is a greater awareness of the the benefits that the the feminine side of people offers you know as well as men you know when you	3869	A
half a generation ago wouldn't have even considered as feasible	3869	A
um-hum	3869	A
um-hum	3869	A
yes	3869	A
that's true that is fairly recent	3869	A
uh-huh	3869	A
i feel- i definitely feel that that's true in the political arena it's gonna be a lot longer before women are in positions of authority- authority on a on a majority basis you know there's always gonna be a a few but	3869	A
you know whereas in education and in health care women dominate because those are seen as supportive roles	3869	A
i think it's interesting to just look at the history of women in history- in in several cultures to to determine why in Western culture	3869	A
they take the role that they do because it's- it's a matriarchial society in a lot of different parts of the world that that puts women in a much stronger position and yet in the west it's	3869	A
just coming around to the point that we can recognize that the power that that a woman offers to the society you know in terms of nurturing as well as	3869	A
um-hum um-hum	3869	A
that's exciting	3869	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3869	A
uh still a lot of that influence	3869	A
yes yes and there's so much that's	3869	A
um {inculturated} we don't realize in the home how we're	3869	A
how we're influenced i think that even though my parents might've said you know i'm i'm in an area uh health care where there are a lot of women obviously but	3869	A
my orientation was never toward being a physician it was toward being a health care provider in another area and	3869	A
even though i heard from my my father it certainly go you know pursue as far as you can you can be a physician there was this under lying tone in our home because my mom did not work outside the home that it was also okay to not do that and so	3869	A
it's been a challenge to to cope with both of my orientations i- i have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside the home	3869	A
um-hum hum	3869	A
yes i think that over time we will recognize what	3869	A
our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather that- that are different from men and and it's okay that	3869	A
that there are some differences but that there are also a lot more areas that can overlap that that at this point don't i think girls are told that they're probably not gonna be as good at math as as boys are and and they they	3869	A
they may be influenced by that in their school work	3869	A
i don't know if i was by my by the influence or whether i just am not very oriented in math as i am to other like verbal	3869	A
okay um i think although there have been some i'm still of the opinion that we're second rate citizens in most areas	3869	B
uh i believe probably World War II is when you know the thing started that caused	3869	B
women to be more liberated because the men were at war and they needed women in the factories and things have never been the same	3869	B
as far as the	3869	B
as far as the job market women started working outside the home then but it's taken a long time and i think we've got a long way to go	3869	B
yeah i agree with that	3869	B
um-hum	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
no	3869	B
no and then i think it's a good turn i do see uh one of the reasons i also believe there's a lot to be ahead as i return to college and uh	3869	B
i see girls of twenty or so they think there is no problem they don't realize the struggle's just at the last few years	3869	B
for them especially to go into professions that they could've just been laughed at and it can't be done anymore at least legally it can't be done	3869	B
i think	3869	B
yes and i think- just like today i mean it- may be	3869	B
people that don't want you in a certain profession they can't state it where i don't think the change has come like from the men's side is they can still feel it	3869	B
you know i think	3869	B
yes	3869	B
yes	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
um-hum	3869	B
yeah	3869	B
right	3869	B
yeah i wasn't aware of that either until uh just a year ago when i took a sociology course that even existed that's how indoctrinated i was	3869	B
but then i'm forty six i grew up with the generation of the guys my brothers went to college and i'm now struggling to no and it	3869	B
wasn't important you know you go be a secretary or be a beautician	3869	B
that was my choice and uh	3869	B
but yeah i didn't even realize there were societies like you say where women were were important	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
right	3869	B
well i find myself looking towards what i'm doing and i'm leaning towards education and that's still another area of women but	3869	B
that's what i wanna do you know have made- i have made that decision that that's what i want to do even if it is the traditional thing it's still what i wanna do and i know it's like	3869	B
right	3869	B
yes i'm suffering- suffering through that too yeah	3869	B
i was very seriously	3869	B
well i'm not because i have been tested by the office-	3869	B
let's see um	3836	A
have you heard anything in particular about the universal health care system- uh health insurance program that they're talking about	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
and it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan	3836	A
yeah especially for major corporations	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yes	3836	A
well	3836	A
oh yeah they keep uh the AMA you've got to go through the AMA to get accepted into medical school	3836	A
and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in	3836	A
but uh now dental school that's yeah if they've got a glut on the market of dentists um	3836	A
i i i don't mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high	3836	A
and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i don't think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such	3836	A
that's probably the worst thing about health care right now is the unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice and	3836	A
it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didn't do something wrong rather than proving that he did	3836	A
and if he doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right	3836	A
then suddenly he's got you know two or three years wages down the toilet but uh	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
uh-huh	3836	A
yeah there are physicians getting away with murder	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yes	3836	A
yeah	3836	A
yeah uh	3836	A
from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion	3836	A
they're not feeling you know insulted they're it's like that's a little you know sweat off my brow simply because	3836	A
i mean you know they're- they're covering their own tail legally and you know a second opinion	3836	A
well i haven't heard any of the specific details of uh what they have planned but uh	3836	B
basically the noise around Washington is that uh they're concerned that uh there's not enough health care insurance provided that uh very few families have uh health care insurance or	3836	B
any kind of uh coverage where they're employed	3836	B
uh i'm not sure that there's any real plan afoot	3836	B
to uh bring a health care plan on line that requires everybody to kick in like uh Social Security	3836	B
but uh one of the plan that's been circulated about is a requirement	3836	B
that employers provide uh health care insurance for their employees and kick in something like eighty percent of the cost of that insurance	3836	B
and uh if they don't do that then they have to pay into a federal fund that provides the uh health care insurance	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
i tell you one thing that uh we were discussing this evening here that uh discourages me a little bit and worries me about the health care system	3836	B
uh i know that certainly in this region uh that the number of students graduating from dental school has been quite large	3836	B
and a lot of the foreign students that uh came and stayed in this country didn't go back home	3836	B
so there's been a kind of dentists are kind of glut on the market and they're uh having a lot of trouble competing and making ends meet	3836	B
and uh physicians i think may be facing the same situation except they apparently have a very strong	3836	B
organization and they are actually preventing students from entering medical college	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
uh-huh	3836	B
well i think that's sort of happened universally to all our industries i think our light plane industry went out of business because the uh cost of uh manufacturers' product liability was too high	3836	B
uh but i think on the other side of the coin that uh maybe the AMA is being a little bit too protective of some of their physicians uh	3836	B
yeah i've i've got my own set of war stories uh my daughter uh turns out she's allergic to gnats	3836	B
and the first time i went in to have it treated it cost two thousand five hundred dollars	3836	B
and the second time i went to a different doctor and the doctor said oh she's allergic to gnats give her some Benadryl that was a two dollar and forty five cent treatment for it	3836	B
and so uh you know four days in the hospital the children's ward on IV penicillin uh was a lot less effective than a couple of teaspoons full of Benadryl	3836	B
and i have other friends that uh have really been misdiagnosed	3836	B
and i think it's probably a shame that there isn't more competition among doctors and there isn't a little more policing	3836	B
uh of the results	3836	B
yeah	3836	B
yeah	3875	B
i use to i don't now	3875	B
oh really	3875	B
yeah that is what it is in Arizona Arizona is where i am from	3875	B
i have only been in California for about two years	3875	B
and in Arizona that is all they have too is man made lakes because of the desert	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
well i lived in Washington State for a while do you know where do you know where Seattle is well it's about thirty miles outside of Seattle there is a place called Westport	3875	B
and it use to be the salmon capitol of the world and when i lived	3875	B
yeah when i lived there i use to go deep sea fishing with my dad all the time and it was really it was really neat but when i went back to Arizona because_1 that is where i am from well when i went back there to be with my mom	3875	B
it was like a totally different kind of fishing i was like ah what do i do	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
i haven't i haven't been fishing since i've been to California because_1 i have been having my kids and	3875	B
two	3875	B
two little boys	3875	B
one's three and one's one	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
sounds like fun	3875	B
i'm stopping at two	3875	B
yes	3875	B
i only want to have to teach two of them how to fish i don't want to have to teach four	3875	B
oh	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
yeah it's amazing how few women actually fish	3875	B
yeah	3875	B
uh-huh	3875	B
yeah my husband gets kind of upset because him and i have an agreement	3875	B
i i'll bait my own hook and i'll catch the fish but he's the one cleaning them because_1 i won't clean them that's the only thing i will not do	3875	B
and uh	3875	B
he gets really disgusted because_1 he he says i i talk to the fish i don't talk to the fish they just jump on my hook	3875	B
that's what he says because i'm really lucky at catching them_1	3875	B
no matter what kind of fishing we are doing i i seem to have really good luck and it's like i don't talk to um and they just jump on my hook i don't know	3875	B
yeah my mom got remarried and she got remarried to uh a commercial fisherman	3875	B
and he was like women don't know how to fish and {da} {da} {da} {da} so him and i went out fishing one day	3875	B
and i and he goes do you need me to bait your hook and i said no i can handle it	3875	B
and so i baited my hook and by the time we left i had six and he had none	3875	B
he goes he goes tell you what	3875	B
why don't you do my job for a while	3875	B
i said no thanks cause i don't clean them	3875	B
so he cleaned them all and i gave him and my mom four of them and i just took two of them	3875	B
but he was just so disgusted because he had never seen anybody that had that good of luck	3875	B
oh yeah i love fish	3875	B
i i grew up in Arizona so i guess that's why because	3875	B
so fishing huh	3875	A
you do much fishing out there	3875	A
did	3875	A
well you know we moved from California we moved from northern California to come out here and uh i	3875	A
we did quite a quite a bit of fishing out there but uh out here in uh in Texas it's all man made lake	3875	A
oh is that right	3875	A
oh	3875	A
yeah well that's kind of the thing here in in Dallas and it's it's a whole different kind of fishing than	3875	A
than uh i uh am use to in California i'm use to deep sea fishing out there and fishing off the pier and stuff and uh out here in Dallas you have to use lures and	3875	A
uh all kinds of different things i haven't had a chance to go out fishing much here but i use to do a lot of fishing out in California	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
oh yeah	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
wow they did a lot of salmon fishing up there then	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
yeah it is and uh the bait that they use is uh is totally different in California than it is here in Texas and uh	3875	A
um you know we uh use to use live bait in in California and they do use some live bait here but not a not uh whole lot not like you know you use to use in California and uh	3875	A
yeah how many kids do you have	3875	A
two	3875	A
two little boys	3875	A
wow you got two little ones then huh well i have got four i have got a twelve year old an eleven and uh	3875	A
six and a three	3875	A
so	3875	A
you are oh	3875	A
that's true	3875	A
oh that's we use to have a lot of fun when i was actually my my two boys were born here in Texas but	3875	A
uh my two girls i use to take them with me when when uh we would go fishing you know and my wife and i use to like fishing off the pier and stuff and we'd catch uh shoot one time she she caught a couple of sharks off the pier	3875	A
and uh you know we caught uh what do you call uh those flat things	3875	A
and we you know we'd get crab and stuff off the pier and and uh	3875	A
that's that's stuff that we that we miss um being here in Texas we don't have much of a chance to get out to the coast and and uh	3875	A
yeah my wife loved to fish she didn't like to uh she doesn't like to put the bait on but	3875	A
you know that was my job i just put the bait on and she'd catch the fish in fact we use to go out and and this was not really that funny at the time but	3875	A
it's funny now you know i'd we would get two poles	3875	A
and i would you know i hook hers up she would be out there and i haven't uh i i i wouldn't even be able to tie my hook on	3875	A
she'd catch a fish and she would yell at me to come and take the fish off so i'd take it off and walk back and put my hook on she'd call again to get get the fish off her hook	3875	A
i mean it went like that for a whole hour	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
you'd talk to the fish	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
yeah	3875	A
well uh that's my wife	3875	A
yeah that's my wife uh every time we go fishing she's the one that catches them and i'm the one that takes them off and baits the hook and then it goes all over again so	3875	A
oh is that right	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
oh my heck	3875	A
oh that's funny	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
now do you like eating uh eating fish	3875	A
is that right	3875	A
uh-huh	3875	A
uh well we're right between uh Milwaukee and Chicago	3822	A
so there's there's just been a big Coke bust uh here because i think people pass through	3822	A
you know on their way back and forth through the bigger cities	3822	A
um it's it's okay i mean there's crime everywhere it it's	3822	A
probably not	3822	A
it's not you know the	3822	A
best place	3822	A
to be but	3822	A
yeah it's right next to Racine	3822	A
oh really	3822	A
uh	3822	A
yeah-	3822	A
oh yeah it's like ten minutes away from me	3822	A
no	3822	A
really it's that bad	3822	A
the crime- because of the crime	3822	A
wow	3822	A
with the	3822	A
oh yeah	3822	A
no it's not	3822	A
it	3822	A
it yeah it's gotten worse too nothing's getting better	3822	A
seems like it's always getting worse	3822	A
i think it has to get worse first before it can get better	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
they need something and it	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
i heard uh Dallas cops are really strict like	3822	A
oh yeah	3822	A
whoa	3822	A
yeah same here certain parts of our city uh you just don't go by you just don't	3822	A
because_1 then you're asking for trouble	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
twenty one	3822	A
yep	3822	A
twenty three	3822	A
yeah uh	3822	A
actually uh my sister lives in Racine	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
it's bigger than Kenosha by a little bit and their crime rate's crime rate's a lot worse than ours	3822	A
yeah they just some guy uh couple months ago he got out a machete did you read about that and started just hacking people in the street with it	3822	A
yeah	3822	A
oh that was in Racine	3822	A
it's sad i mean you can't even drive or walk down the street at night or anything	3822	A
i've heard of that	3822	A
uh-huh	3822	A
uh how- how's the crime rate up there	3822	B
okay	3822	B
uh-huh	3822	B
yeah	3822	B
right	3822	B
is it anywhere near Racine	3822	B
really my uh old old girlfriend uh was from there	3822	B
yeah uh actually i went- i went and saw her about four years ago her parents had moved to Chicago and uh	3822	B
at this point they had moved out of Dallas and everything then they had moved back and she was going to school down here and i went and saw her one summer and uh we went up there	3822	B
i never been up there i just remember	3822	B
it's a different area from down here obviously but uh	3822	B
uh so you're a cheese head huh yeah well we're i mean down here i mean Dallas i mean this crime rate's ridiculous i mean it's just	3822	B
i'm getting ready to move actually in the probably the next year or so so i mean but	3822	B
it's it yeah i mean it isn't Washington DC but it's there's just so many uh	3822	B
i mean we've had like four or five uh since school started like uh in high school people uh	3822	B
incidents where kids shooting you know a teacher or you know since you know the school year and everything like New Year's Eve there were three people shot right away i mean like in the first ten minutes of the new year you know so	3822	B
it's just been it's ridiculous there's a lot of problems right now i mean the uh	3822	B
the police chief out here is the former assistant police chief uh Darryl Gates in LA	3822	B
so i mean he's not like you know beating up anybody but	3822	B
there's just it's a big city and it's what you know you get and there's there's just getting a lot it's getting overcrowded and there's a lot of uh	3822	B
immigrants from uh Mexico and stuff so	3822	B
it's it's it's getting pretty ridiculous	3822	B
but uh	3822	B
i'm sure you know since you're near Chicago i'm sure you could	3822	B
it's not exactly a peaceful city either you know	3822	B
so it's the same situation really	3822	B
so i'm actually in Richardson which is just north of Dallas it's a little suburb	3822	B
but	3822	B
yeah i mean	3822	B
yeah i don't see how it can get better i mean it's got to totally	3822	B
yeah stricter laws or something that	3822	B
uh	3822	B
if i could solve problems i'd be a rich person but guess i can't	3822	B
i'm just it's one of those deals where i mean you know try to look at you know look at at other countries what they do but i mean we're not like barbarics uh i don't	3822	B
you know it's just too many problems with uh people getting paroled before- uh you know early and coming out committing another crime while they're still on probation we've had a lot of problems out here with that course	3822	B
well it's it's kind of yeah they shoot first then ask questions later you know that's that's their motto	3822	B
they're they're not uh	3822	B
you got to be careful if i mean i never had a problem i mean i'm not like	3822	B
hang- just you just don't hang out in Dallas or you got to be you know where not to be at night and the you know	3822	B
just are certain places you don't even	3822	B
certain parts of town you just stay away from you know	3822	B
right and you just	3822	B
yeah you just leave it alone i mean	3822	B
oh yeah oh	3822	B
how old are you	3822	B
twenty one yeah	3822	B
oh i'm twenty three	3822	B
yeah uh	3822	B
that's pretty wild right next to Racine huh	3822	B
really	3822	B
God i never thought i would ever run into somebody	3822	B
look i'll read the paper every now and then and something Racine Wisconsin will pop out you know but yeah it's just kind of a little town um	3822	B
really	3822	B
with- with the machete no i didn't hear about that	3822	B
God	3822	B
well uh in Wheaton Illinois where her parents live and that's where that uh	3822	B
yeah it's just like forty five miles outside of Chicago and few years ago i guess there was some uh	3822	B
i think it was some	3822	B
um some lady was like shot- uh	3822	B
killed- attacked some school children-	3822	B
okay i pushed it	3899	A
so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution	3899	A
yeah well you know what i was talking to my brother in Denver	3899	A
and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace	3899	A
yeah i couldn't believe-	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
yeah i can't understand-	3899	A
yeah i just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places that's all that all the heat they have in their home	3899	A
you know	3899	A
well i know yeah isn't that terrible	3899	A
well i don't know all i know is that we have to have our car- our car smogged every two years you know and um	3899	A
um-hum well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just they don't wanna they wanna use uh	3899	A
you know something that's gonna burn all this gas where we can buy more gas you know	3899	A
um um-hum um-hum	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
well i don't know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down Southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this	3899	A
crud you know it oh it's terrible	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
yeah	3899	A
yeah it- it- it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these trucks that's on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those trucks just smoke like heck you know	3899	A
but it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that	3899	A
um-hum	3899	A
no the electric cars i think that was a good idea i would really go for that	3899	A
yeah right right	3899	A
i	3899	A
um-hum um-hum	3899	A
um-hum um-hum	3899	A
yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that we're gonna be in the house all day	3899	A
you know and it's just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i don't use mine	3899	A
yeah right-	3899	A
right right	3899	A
yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large companies and uh-huh	3899	A
right- right right right so	3899	A
uh-huh	3899	B
okay	3899	B
well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that we're we're doing way too much of that although i'm not sure	3899	B
the one thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whether- how whether that's a very serious one or not um	3899	B
you know uh with	3899	B
well that's what i've heard it kills me because i love fires and i and i really really care about pollution and i don't use anything that's got the the the stuff- stuff- the	3899	B
stuff in it you know the spray bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but that's the one thing that i think is	3899	B
very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural	3899	B
that's a that's a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but	3899	B
that that that's what they have yeah but um i you know i- i am really concerned about it because you can you're beginning to- well you're beginning to see the air	3899	B
and and that's frightening and i know in California uh a whole lot is being done i don't know how well that's working and if all those things all those laws went through	3899	B
about about the for the car manufacturers and everything and- has that do you know	3899	B
yeah	3899	B
uh-huh	3899	B
but i think what they're gonna do is try to get the try to get the car manufacturers to make cars that you know use gasoline more- more- uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel	3899	B
yes i think that's right i think that's right but it's scary what it's doing to to stone buildings	3899	B
you know the the acid rain i mean destroying things trees are dying lot of forests are are dying of these uh in Canada and in in uh	3899	B
i don't know about_1 i don't know about_1 in California	3899	B
um-hum um-hum	3899	B
yeah well and- and i had not experienced it as much my son went to Pomona and he went	3899	B
the school starts in the fall and that is the notorious smog season so when he first went out there about five- you know five-	3899	B
uh a long time ago four or five years ago but anyway he- he called and just said mother now i know what they're talking about i mean this stuff you really feel you can't breathe	3899	B
uh-huh	3899	B
yeah yeah yeah	3899	B
no i know and and as far as what i you know i do things about almost everything else but as far as the air is concerned i am trying to buy a new car but there are no cars available with clean fuel	3899	B
so i can't do that um i just	3899	B
yeah yeah	3899	B
uh yeah i would too but that and it it's not affordable and it's not out there	3899	B
and then i have stopped using anything but pump sprays so that i'm trying to get i'm trying not to use that whatever that's called chlorofluorocarbons-	3899	B
some kind of anyway that's that's hurting the ozone uh level i'm trying not to do that	3899	B
oh no no no i didn't either yes	3899	B
yeah	3899	B
yeah but	3899	B
no and i i'm not sure i'm not sure that this is something that air pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of the other ones	3899	B
uh like recycling or even water you know water use or saving water and that's what's scary to me	3899	B
large companies that's right industry and the car manufacturers	3899	B
and uh that we have less control i guess it depends on who we vote for and how we write	3899	B
you know write letters to them	3899	B
well what do you think about your everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy	3845	A
oh	3845	A
right	3845	A
yeah i think that that's the only thing i wrote down also because that's just a	3845	A
it's terrible today i mean my wife and i it seems like i get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and and it rings up until ten and- eleven o'clock sometimes	3845	A
yes i know -that's true	3845	A
yeah that's true	3845	A
but you know people	3845	A
it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls	3845	A
i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day and and a lot a days i'll get to and three calls from	3845	A
from people selling insurance you know to the small business man	3845	A
and uh you know i think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your according to what i've understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in New York and uh	3845	A
California always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever	3845	A
and now i getting the same calls at at the house	3845	A
and they get your- and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet and uh credit card companies they sell your name	3845	A
i know	3845	A
yes	3845	A
American Express does that by the way	3845	A
yeah i understand they sell their- you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them_1	3845	A
and uh that is an invasion of privacy you're right	3845	A
i know that's true	3845	A
exactly magazine companies uh from from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money	3845	A
but it's uh you know i guess it uh you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an American Express card so your name is valuable to i guess X amount of solicitors calling	3845	A
so i don't know	3845	A
where- where do you where you from	3845	A
oh okay well so yeah we live in the Dallas area Richardson	3845	A
okay laughter	3845	A
did you	3845	A
yeah i've got i talked to people in Utah people in New York and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and i'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state	3845	A
i'll be darn where you from not from Texas	3845	A
New Jersey right yeah yeah my wife's from New Jersey	3845	A
yeah from uh Saddle River	3845	A
she	3845	A
okay	3845	A
well that's nice too	3845	A
really yes- my wife's been away since- we've been married twenty five years so she she's been away for quite a while	3845	A
her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas and her mother was from New York so they just	3845	A
they officed over there in New Jersey	3845	A
so but anyway yeah this topic is it's a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that's the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling	3845	A
i know	3845	A
that's a that's a good suggestion i might start using the answering machine more because you know it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings	3845	A
right	3845	A
sure	3845	A
you yeah you're probably right	3845	A
i understand i mean i it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriff's association and and	3845	A
i know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival- carnival or circus and then	3845	A
right there's always a different- and and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night	3845	A
uh	3845	B
well the uh what i really i don't like is the call- the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things	3845	B
you know people trying to solicit for different you know organizations	3845	B
now that's what i really	3845	B
never stops ringing right	3845	B
that's right well you know the the great uh things of that its a is is an answering machine i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know you just switch that thing on and uh	3845	B
yeah	3845	B
hum even in an office	3845	B
uh-huh	3845	B
right	3845	B
um-hum	3845	B
right right	3845	B
um-hum i know	3845	B
oh yeah uh well you know these people they sell your names i mean you know i that's also an invasion of privacy i think if the whole thing is a	3845	B
oh they do	3845	B
well sure it is	3845	B
that's right well you know if you've ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever	3845	B
um-hum	3845	B
that's right	3845	B
yeah that's right	3845	B
but	3845	B
oh i'm from Texas	3845	B
oh well- we're in Plano	3845	B
well you know the only call i really got that well was out of state i got one from Oklahoma City and one from California	3845	B
and that was uh California i was thrilled to death because that's the you know the furthest i'd gotten any call from you know and um	3845	B
oh really	3845	B
oh	3845	B
yeah see well that's uh that- there was another call on Saturday- Saturday that was also from uh that was the one from California	3845	B
i don't know why i guess people on the weekends from out of state -will uh i don't know you know but	3845	B
uh originally from New Jersey	3845	B
yeah	3845	B
oh really what part	3845	B
oh that's nice over there yeah we're from more uh from a sort of towards the shore central New Jersey you know we're like uh	3845	B
yeah oh yeah it was beautiful that's why i- i really miss it i- i don't really like it here at all	3845	B
uh-huh	3845	B
yeah so their	3845	B
yeah	3845	B
well yeah i mean yeah yeah and and you- know- of course they call you know before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd i the you know i the the minute i get home the phone would be ringing uh	3845	B
oh it's great i mean	3845	B
uh you know uh end this call press three and i assumed i was you know was from the switchboard you know yeah it is because_1 one day i listened you know and it was	3845	B
you know but um i- i just got totally disgusted and and you know people asking for for money for everything you know i mean it-	3845	B
exactly and you know the policeman's association and-	3845	B
oh i used to do that yeah i used to do that i'd say- or three kids to the movies or something	3845	B
okay	3855	B
oh we use them	3855	B
for paying our gas	3855	B
for paying	3855	B
uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks so we use it quite a bit	3855	B
but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards	3855	B
if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free so we never have to pay anything extra	3855	B
yeah we just don't think it's worth it	3855	B
so	3855	B
uh-huh	3855	B
see well you i don't do it either	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
yes exactly that's how i feel- i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something	3855	B
yeah and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our MasterCard or whatever	3855	B
and then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later	3855	B
and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a little- even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later	3855	B
oh yeah	3855	B
yeah even if it's five bucks even	3855	B
yeah	3855	B
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in	3855	B
and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt	3855	B
you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then	3855	B
you know you can have your card back with	3855	B
pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever	3855	B
i know	3855	B
yeah exactly	3855	B
yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody	3855	B
yeah so	3855	B
um	3855	B
oh i also use like to use Discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year	3855	B
yeah yeah	3855	B
well we just started doing that and	3855	B
you know what it comes in handy is for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes	3855	B
because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but i mean it's still something we got two fifty last year	3855	B
and so it's you know it helps out here and there	3855	B
so	3855	B
yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year	3855	B
and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something	3855	B
and so that's what	3855	B
and i know we're going to get back more this year because they	3855	B
you know we spent a little bit more	3855	B
probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too	3855	B
and they increase the percentage a little bit	3855	B
yeah i pushed in	3855	A
so how do you use your credit cards	3855	A
um-hum	3855	A
yeah that's me i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee	3855	A
you know and um i'm uh like you i i use it	3855	A
well to buy my gas with my Shell- my Shell credit card i use that	3855	A
and then like my Emporium card and uh	3855	A
Weinstocks card i use that but i'm like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i don't just write a check i don't know	3855	A
you know it's just really weird but i i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse	3855	A
yeah you know enough for a phone call and that's about all	3855	A
but uh	3855	A
other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't- they can't charge any more	3855	A
you know and i think that's terrible	3855	A
oh yeah	3855	A
yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why	3855	A
it really does help	3855	A
yeah	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because you- there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket	3855	A
they're going to hit you over the head	3855	A
i know it just uh you know it just seems like they're somebody's always watching	3855	A
so i just don't i don't carry money i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know	3855	A
right	3855	A
yeah	3855	A
yeah right	3855	A
yeah right	3855	A
and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything	3855	A
you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amount- i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you	3855	A
you know so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
well let's see what else can i say about credit cards	3855	A
um	3855	A
yeah i don't i don't uh that that that's that Sears Discovery Card is that what that	3855	A
yeah now i don't have that one you know	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3855	A
oh you mean uh for for you using your credit card you get like a rebate or something	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
oh i see	3855	A
uh-huh	3855	A
um i see	3855	A
yeah well i'll	3855	A
well it's uh certainly would would help things out uh i don't see a terribly lot of it going on uh here	3871	B
i was actually quite surprised i went to uh San Francisco recently uh to Berkeley and and uh	3871	B
they actually have mandatory recycling- well no theirs theirs is not mandatory i'm sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see everybody with you know with with ten bags of things and they and they have a community recycling center uh where	3871	B
rather than than having monetary incentives for the for the people that actually bring stuff into recycling they're just doing it to help out the city and then the city can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled	3871	B
yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off of it um	3871	B
it's just the recycling per se but uh we do very little uh recycle newspapers but other than that	3871	B
kind of a shame	3871	B
um-hum um-hum	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
right	3871	B
yeah i- i- i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling centers that is what i saw in Berkeley was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh	3871	B
in different- in each for different things uh uh you know they even had a specific- specific of course being in wine country they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the wineries would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly	3871	B
yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them_1 uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the aluminum and then for plastics and	3871	B
apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe ten fifteen blocks away from where these friend of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didn't get anything for it but but um	3871	B
you know the thing is that that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the the proceeds from from recycled things	3871	B
yeah that's what i am saying you know they could pay for if they you know if they have to have somebody there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff	3871	B
you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling the glass or or aluminum or whatever	3871	B
and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where people brought books they didn't want put them on the shelf and people- anybody- you just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and	3871	B
it was uh it was quite a quite an operation	3871	B
yeah	3871	B
no no it's	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
yeah	3871	B
oh oh i haven't seen those now i- i- i think i have seen them_1 actually going with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans people put them out separately	3871	B
and they'll they'll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the truck or something but	3871	B
hm yeah i- i- i think that that there's a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling	3871	B
is is a is a little bit wrong you know certainly there's money- you know -it's valuable to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so	3871	B
um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give people money for it	3871	B
oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but there's a lot of computer paper generated so it's you know generally clean white paper	3871	B
and uh	3871	B
um-hum	3871	B
oh	3871	B
well what do you think about recycling	3871	A
i don't see a lot of it here either	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
well i think if they had some place up up up in your area like i know they don't here	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
that's true	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
we we do our cans and stuff but um	3871	A
um you know i don't know if i- if there is someplace close by where you could take everything i know in our neighborhood every so often every few months they'll put in our subdivision they'll put out um	3871	A
like dump trucks so you can get rid of your trash and garbage in your yard and they'll haul it off for you and it is all free if they did something like that and they they'll get a chipper you know like in the spring and in the fall	3871	A
if they did the same thing for recycling i think that would go over real well	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
wow	3871	A
and recycle them	3871	A
were they all over the community	3871	A
uh-huh	3871	A
right	3871	A
well it couldn't like glass companies buy the glass back from uh the city or something like that	3871	A
right	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
well i'll be	3871	A
well that's pretty neat maybe it'll catch on all over but i haven't really seen it around here hardly at all	3871	A
um i have seen where one um i think trash company will put out you put out a bin but it it was never explained what you put in it	3871	A
you know and do they really you know i haven't seen a special kind of a truck oh in this area now i've seen them_1 uh around Austin uh some they're- they're like three division trucks you know it has three compartments	3871	A
huh	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
right	3871	A
yeah i know i know if they did something like that at work you know if they separated paper where i work they don't even separate the paper	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
yeah	3871	A
now see they don't even do it where i work for a private laboratory and you know that uh ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it and they they shred all of it	3871	A
you know and i would think you know and i see them_1 carry them_1 out	3871	A
it's beautiful it's wonderful i love it it's not January	3878	B
it's sunny there's a few light wispy little clouds floating around there's a light breeze it's about sixty three degrees	3878	B
it's wonderful my son and i have been out for a couple of walks today	3878	B
yeah	3878	B
um it stopped raining	3878	B
let's see	3878	B
Monday- Monday or Tuesday Monday it stopped raining it's been raining	3878	B
until then	3878	B
was it	3878	B
and it's but it has been real icky well no it it rained Monday night it rained	3878	B
it stopped raining Monday night like Tuesday it was it was clear but it's been really nasty the clouds have been over cast even though it's been kind of warm so that it is muggy	3878	B
that wasn't very good either	3878	B
uh we did we got snow about a week and a half ago	3878	B
and it was it was really wild because uh	3878	B
the snow was um	3878	B
it didn't stick	3878	B
but it flurried and you could see it	3878	B
but it uh it didn't stick any	3878	B
yeah it was nice it turned into it was like rain it because it was warm even it was above freezing	3878	B
but it was between uh	3878	B
just where the clouds were and where you know but when the snow got down here	3878	B
it was cold enough to freeze it and then it just stayed frozen it was wet snow i guess is what they call it when is starts thawing before it hits the ground	3878	B
really	3878	B
oh yeah well i am wondering about the summer what is summer going to be like if winter is this temperate	3878	B
we are bound to have a real dozy of a summer	3878	B
but	3878	B
i don't know i've i've had um i have Easter lilies that i grow in my back yard and they have already started up	3878	B
and it's way too early	3878	B
for Easter lilies they shouldn't be up until March when the the flowers actually start to bloom	3878	B
already coming in bloom	3878	B
oh please	3878	B
i- i put down crocus this year thinking oh well it will get cold in January and February you know and i won't have to worry about it	3878	B
i don't think i am going to get crocus this spring	3878	B
no i don't think it got cold enough for them to come out	3878	B
we don't have as many wild flowers here as there are down toward Austin i use to go to school in San Marcus so i'm familiar with Austin and the area	3878	B
i think so i think the highways are going to be great	3878	B
i'm ready to travel	3878	B
oh	3878	B
uh-huh i agree that's a	3878	B
uh-huh	3878	B
i agree and it's be probably be wonderful out there	3878	B
well i'm wishing i'm i'm wishing i had made a picnic for my son and i put down a blanket or a a sleeping bag and had a picnic outside	3878	B
yeah that that's what'll be great when all the wild flowers come out take yourself out a picnic and	3878	B
oh really	3878	B
we're not suppose to get it until about Monday Sunday night or Monday	3878	B
well we've uh yeah we have-	3878	B
oh	3878	B
i guess not	3878	B
although they revise they revise our weather report about every other day it changes it seems like but hey have been saying it was going to rain	3878	B
Saturday afternoon but now we are under a big high	3878	B
or high pressure	3878	B
so we're um	3878	B
we're going to be stable for a while they say through Sunday	3878	B
yeah that'd be	3878	B
uh-huh	3878	B

right	3878	A
well the weather man said it's suppose to start raining again for us tomorrow	3878	A
and through the weekend	3878	A
oh maybe it'll might we might not get it here when	3878	A
well they told us it was going to rain today too we don't have the most reliable weather men	3878	A
no they said it was going to rain today	3878	A
yeah	3878	A
yeah	3878	A
yeah	3878	A
oh good	3878	A
maybe we might get some of that it seems like there's a line there at Waco where it'll come to Waco and then go and we won't get it	3878	A
or it'll go up as far as Waco and then move over and Dallas won't get it	3878	A
you know	3878	A
but uh i hope it will be pretty this weekend i- i can't wait cause it's rained oh i know for the last four or five weekends here	3878	A
it's just been miserable and i want to get outside and barbecue	3878	A
that'll be fun	3878	A
but uh	3878	A
yeah i can't wait	3878	A
as Texas El Paso uh they were undefeated until uh Thursday night when they played the University of Utah here in Salt Lake City and uh	3890	A
they were beaten by uh a last minute three point shot	3890	A
and uh so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play uh Brigham Young University tonight	3890	A
and uh i i'm pretty sure uh they really got a good team this year and i think-	3890	A
uh yes they do uh they usually uh they're usually the one or two in the in the WAC conference and they're the only team from Texas	3890	A
uh-huh	3890	A
uh-huh	3890	A
yeah who's doing the who's leading the conference	3890	A
uh i see	3890	A
oh	3890	A
oh oh i see	3890	A
that kind of fouled things up plus maybe	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
right well last year the University of Utah went and uh they had two of their stars uh	3890	A
got hurt the beginning of the season this year and that's why uh uh Texas El Paso is uh is in the University of Utah went to the NC Double A's last year and they- got into the final sixteen i guess but	3890	A
uh UTEP like i say is doing real well and it's it's too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the	3890	A
uh the Longhorns as far as uh being able to play in any of the	3890	A
junior college so it didn't affect their program other than loosing him yeah right that's too bad	3890	A
yeah but	3890	A
oh that's too bad	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
i see	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
good i know uh i was in Montana this last week and i saw the uh	3890	A
huh the women's team from uh Texas was playing uh Penn State	3890	A
and uh Penn State was ranked number eight i believe in the women's basketball and i- i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight uh back to Utah and i uh Texas was leading	3890	A
i don't know how they came out i don't know if you heard or not but uh	3890	A
oh	3890	A
yeah	3890	A
um-hum	3890	A
i wish them well	3890	A
that's great	3890	A
i'll say	3890	A
yeah uh that's uh	3890	A
last year the University of Utah that was the best season they'd had and uh the well the the coach had come in this Rick Majerus he'd come in uh he'd only been there a couple years and uh	3890	A
really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the the first uh uh top ten this year until they lost their two of their their star players and uh through injuries	3890	A
and now they are uh they they did beat uh Texas El Paso and uh that was kind of strange i guess Texas El Paso was just weren't weren't uh	3890	A
hitting and uh	3890	A
oh really hum	3890	B
oh my gosh	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
do do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing	3890	B
huh	3890	B
huh	3890	B
huh yeah see we're it's they're actually in the University of Texas system and i don't i don't even know anything about them_1 i'm here in Austin we have uh University- UT Austin	3890	B
right which is which i mean- i just generally go to the University of Texas right and	3890	B
the the Longhorns um	3890	B
and uh	3890	B
actually- actually i don't know right now Longhorns aren't having quite the year that they had hoped um they they had a a star forward that that was disqualified because of	3890	B
of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they uh some supporter gave him a car or something and uh	3890	B
yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they they're they're holding on but it's not it's not going to be a a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
yeah	3890	B
no it it it something had happened outside of that you know and and it happened as as part of his junior college career	3890	B
but no but they pulled him out of the out of the lineup	3890	B
you know and it was something he he reported himself or i mean they it wasn't a and and the NCAA uh immediately suspended him and then	3890	B
and then actually UT on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so	3890	B
yeah but	3890	B
they've been having uh i mean last- last- last year they had a real good team they had every- they had a new coach Tom Penders come in um about i guess about three years ago	3890	B
and and the the program had been in a long a long decline you know for for years they i guess back when Abe Lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition	3890	B
and then it it kind of went downhill for about_1 for a couple of coaches and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but	3890	B
yeah	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
hum	3890	B
i don't know yeah uh the women's program is quite interesting down here the the women's program here in in Austin um	3890	B
actually for a while it was was drawing bigger crowds than the men's program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean they've they've always been in the top	3890	B
top eight in the country um and actually had a couple of years that they haven't been quite as strong but but uh	3890	B
the the Southwestern Conference uh they've been undefeated in the Southwestern- they were no they aren't now but they had been undefeated in the Southwestern Conference for something like a five year streak or something	3890	B
and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or something-	3890	B
and so -that is they've they've that's that's quite a tradition here in in Texas but	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
oh yeah	3890	B
um-hum	3890	B
uh-huh	3890	B
right	3890	B
up to speed yeah	3890	B
had to uh face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
yeah	3860	B
well i've been very fortunate uh my father	3860	B
uh was very careful in laying plans for his uh latter years	3860	B
and he was very concerned that uh mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years	3860	B
deciding where he wanted to be	3860	B
and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm	3860	B
and uh invested in a uh nursing home in Central Virginia	3860	B
and uh moved in there	3860	B
and uh he made that decision on his own and uh he made a good choice he found one that had uh pleasant conditions for for him and mother living together and it had a uh nursing home attached to it	3860	B
and everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because uh they moved into the uh to the retirement home in August	3860	B
and he died in September	3860	B
just just before his uh uh eightieth birthday	3860	B
and uh it was fortunate that uh	3860	B
uh he had made those provisions because at that point uh mother had uh Alzheimer's disease	3860	B
and her mental faculties were going very rapidly	3860	B
and that's that's uh something that's very stressful to handle	3860	B
so uh we were very fortunate in having her in the right spot	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
uh-huh	3860	B
yeah my uh i have uh an aunt who's in a uh home in Charlotte North Carolina	3860	B
and they they had planned on that for a number of years and actually uh made the payment on the condominium or the apartment uh oh fifteen years before they moved in	3860	B
and uh so when my aunt finally got to the point her eyesight deteriorated and she could no longer drive and it was getting awkward to get to the store for groceries and things like that	3860	B
and uh she moved in it was only about	3860	B
oh it's walking distance to where she lived so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals	3860	B
um it's kind of amazing the disparity that exists between	3860	B
some-	3860	B
well it's a topic that um my husband and i often discuss because	3860	A
um i don't have any grandparents and my mother is deceased so um we think about that often times with my father but there's plenty of other siblings to help out	3860	A
however on my husband's side um he has one sibling who is mentally retarded and um and then his parents and so we wonder you know how we're going to make ends meet once they're gone	3860	A
um	3860	A
you know my mother-in-law constantly says things like well- you know well i wish if one of us goes i wish we'd all go like in a car accident so that nobody would help nobody would have to worry about it but uh	3860	A
um it's a scary issue i think	3860	A
uh-huh	3860	A
um	3860	A
um	3860	A
wow	3860	A
wow wow	3860	A
um	3860	A
yes i know	3860	A
one	3860	A
um i think that's kind of the ideal situation is to have a combination retirement home nursing home and even you know if they need special care	3860	A
um my husband's grandmother is in a nursing home and	3860	A
i don't think they've termed what she has as Alzheimer's but it you know she reverts a lot back to her childhood	3860	A
and she doesn't know who you are often times- often times she does the one thing that she retains as far as her memory is concerned is um hymns	3860	A
you know religious hymns she can sing them um and remember all the verses but when you talk to her she doesn't know who you are but	3860	A
the home that she is in uh it seems like a nice home but there are a lot of people there that are really bad badly off and they have them all combined together	3860	A
and so her roommate um	3860	A
is um a person who entered herself into the home because she has really bad arthritis but mentally she is completely there so you know i don't know about that type of situation where	3860	A
you know you have a mixture but there is a home here in Dallas that um it's a Methodist home	3860	A
um for the elderly and uh	3860	A
they have that kind of situation it seems like what you were talking about with your parents retirement home and a nursing home	3860	A
you know and even a hospital somewhat attached you know for those who need	3860	A
you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if if i had to one of those	3860	A
um	3860	A
that's about	3860	A
oh really	3860	A
um	3860	A
yeah	3860	A
yeah	3844	B
uh	3844	B
uh yes i do uh	3844	B
well unfortunately i have a cholesterol problem and uh i for a long time i did aerobics	3844	B
but a couple of years ago my uh doctor says no don't do aerobics any more ride the stationary bicycle so that that's what i do for thirty minutes a day i average six days a week	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
oh definitely oh definitely uh it's it's boring	3844	B
no no	3844	B
uh and i- i also belong to uh the Texas Club and uh so some days i uh i go over there and i work out with the the Nautilus weights	3844	B
well uh my goal is uh three days a week but usually it boils down to about one day a week	3844	B
uh do you have a regular regimen	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum	3844	B
yeah oh that's wonderful	3844	B
um	3844	B
um	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah that's extremely important	3844	B
um-hum um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
oh yeah	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
yeah	3844	B
um-hum	3844	B
yeah there's a a program on in the afternoons on channel two at four o'clock do you have a VCR	3844	B
uh you might record it and play it later now it's just uh	3844	B
oh stretch and tone it's not aerobics	3844	B
uh but it's called body electric and it's a a lady broadcasting from Florida and uh it's for thirty minutes it comes on uh	3844	B
five days a week and uh it it- it's a really good supplement to your bike riding	3844	B
uh it helps with flexibility and uh	3844	B
for- uh for some of the exercises she uses three pound weights	3844	B
but uh she's not a a a great weight person but uh sometimes for the uh upper arms and deltoids and	3844	B
uh back muscles she uses these three pound weights	3844	B
so	3844	B
uh-huh	3844	B
all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their New Year's resolutions and going out and getting their regular exercise program um do you exercise regularly	3844	A
and tell me about that if you would	3844	A
uh-huh	3844	A
yes	3844	A
wow	3844	A
well that's great that's fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go	3844	A
well good so you're good- you're using it	3844	A
yes because_1 you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike	3844	A
yeah	3844	A
oh	3844	A
okay	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
yes yes	3844	A
well you've got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but it's	3844	A
on all sorts of athletic teams and and regular programs but since i've gotten into a new job and into my uh career	3844	A
and into a young family time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy	3844	A
is that uh i have bicycles and i have two older boys that they like to ride bicycles with me and we ride as a family	3844	A
and you know uh i actually live in Plano but i'm working here in Dallas and they have some excellent bike paths	3844	A
where you can go and ride for miles and miles and days and days and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun	3844	A
and uh one thing that i've been doing also is that	3844	A
mind you it's not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the boys get on their bikes and uh we we	3844	A
they ride along and i jog along and it's a nice time to spend some some time with the boys too so i'm trying to coordinate	3844	A
you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that	3844	A
and uh there there's a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them_1's in soccer and the other one just loves to do it	3844	A
and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that it's very helpful to them also	3844	A
in my oldest boy's soccer league that uh he doesn't seem to run out of breath as much as the other boys do and	3844	A
he can stay in longer	3844	A
and uh	3844	A
and uh so i- i don't have a a regular one but i i really would	3844	A
i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time every day in the morning if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around six or six thirty	3844	A
which means i'd have to get up way early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning to do that and uh i've also tried to set aside time in the afternoon or evening	3844	A
but uh things generally pop up that preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
uh yes i do	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
oh okay	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
well great	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
oh okay	3844	A
well	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
um-hum	3844	A
well that's that's good that's one thing that i'd	3844	A
and the weights i'd kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately	3844	A
Mike i'm calling from Dallas from Richardson	3802	A
okay well good	3802	A
you know our subject is on boating and sailing	3802	A
and quite honestly with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating	3802	A
oh do you well great	3802	A
well that's neat	3802	A
right	3802	A
i've seen some nice nice sailboats the guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it	3802	A
right in the uh driveway and it seemed i think it held probably uh it must have slept four people anyway	3802	A
right	3802	A
i i understand	3802	A
i'll tell you it's	3802	A
oh they are and you know we have a swimming pool at our house and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because_1 i know it's a lot of maintenance	3802	A
oh gosh yeah	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
sure	3802	A
you bet i know my wife and i were first married her aunt and uncle uncle- aunt and uncle up in New York they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay	3802	A
and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older	3802	A
Chris Craft and we were involved every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that we just worked all the time but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen	3802	A
it was sort of neat we but i think that was the last time we were really involved in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago it is a lot of fun	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter	3802	A
and he had a place on the Lake of the Ozarks and he had a boat and uh	3802	A
i never seen so many boats in all my life people actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying and- townhouse or condominium whatever they own and they they go boats i mean they go if they wanna go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat	3802	A
and that was sort of neat yeah that's- that's that's true that's exactly how they do it they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants that was sort of a neat setup i enjoyed that we spent a week with them i enjoyed that	3802	A
but i'm envious i'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh	3802	A
you bet	3802	A
think- you think you'd really enjoy it	3802	A
yes	3802	A
oh that's	3802	A
yeah that's great	3802	A
oh i know	3802	A
and putt putt sure well that's neat where do you work who are you with	3802	A
well good	3802	A
oh okay great i'm in Addison here	3802	B
right	3802	B
i do uh quite a bit of sailing i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but	3802	B
i haven't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately since it's i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore so it's hard for me to get it somewhere but	3802	B
yeah this one is not that big it's a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of	3802	B
stuck your body out the whole it back into the main part of the sailboat but	3802	B
but it's there they can be black holes to throw money into	3802	B
boats are kind of expensive to maintain	3802	B
especially a bigger one the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat	3802	B
power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it the sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up but you still have to	3802	B
worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it it takes a a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but	3802	B
well it's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation	3802	B
uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it and- but it's uh	3802	B
use the boat for transportation	3802	B
they just go across the boat and get a and- tie it up and go in huh	3802	B
yeah that would be fun	3802	B
i've just never i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but	3802	B
um once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and uh i- i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh	3802	B
i might do something differently i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them_1 keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh	3802	B
yeah i think i would uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because it's so quiet	3802	B
and if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also	3802	B
where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun	3802	B
or if or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the middle of the lake i've with my little one i've been out there many times on a calm summer day	3802	B
where all of a sudden the wind stops and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and	3802	B
and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that and if you have- if you're have- big enough boat to have the little	3802	B
auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in	3802	B
but it's fun i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh	3802	B
i'm a scout leader though so i'm i'm out with-	3802	B
uh well on a daily basis uh at lunch time i take a brisk walk for twenty minutes along with a friend at work	3896	A
i am uh paying for a lifetime membership with President's Health Spa	3896	A
well i don't i don't get there very often	3896	A
but um i figure one of these days i will	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum well i have an exercise bike um also that's that's in my my house	3896	A
and it just sits there	3896	A
um-hum not doing me very much good	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
well i i'm from New York and i'm a lot more inspired here in Dallas than i was there because_1 there's a lot more uh open space	3896	A
and you just- you just see a lot more people doing it you know outside- outside all of the time	3896	A
and	3896	A
hm	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
speaking of bicycling i saw a uh a video in uh Blockbusters	3896	A
and it was something for you to sit on your bike and look at while you're you're um you're doing your workout have you	3896	A
yeah it's like you're going through hills or something and it's	3896	A
yeah have you have you watched one of those yeah	3896	A
oh wow	3896	A
yeah	3896	A
yeah um i keep saying i'm going to um rent one and maybe i i'll get to to get on my bike and- and use it	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
well they have those steppers in President's although i haven't i haven't used one of them but i do see people on them and they they're supposed to be really really really a great uh workout	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
um-hum	3896	A
yeah i've been on the rowing machine at uh President's and uh i i like that	3896	A
well well one thing i find that you know once the first time i joined and went in there they they measured me and weighed- and weighed me and all this stuff and wrote my name down on a little card	3896	A
and they show- take you around they show you all the equipment and then you never see- hear from them again you know you you're really basically on your own	3896	A
you know they tell you how many of these to do and many of those to do and then you- you- you know they never like call you back and say well it's time for us to see how	3896	A
well what kind of exercise do you do	3896	B
okay	3896	B
you're paying for it but not utilizing it too much	3896	B
um	3896	B
yeah i'm not i'm not currently uh enrolled in a athletic club or anything uh	3896	B
i try to get out and do a little bit of running during the week uh when the weather is good or it's a little tough in the winter when it gets dark so early but	3896	B
um uh i try to get out as much as i can	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
sits there and collects dust huh	3896	B
uh i- i lived in Colorado quite a few years and i was more inspired to workout there just because the weather was	3896	B
uh clear more of the time and and i like to stay in better shape to go out and do a lot of skiing and things like that and since i moved to Dallas i guess i haven't been as inspired to get out and do as much	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
yeah i- i find it kind of uh kind of a chore i guess to go uh uh on a regular	3896	B
schedule to work working out inside i'd much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing	3896	B
uh-huh	3896	B
oh is it like a scenery or something	3896	B
no i haven't but i- i have seen some things uh	3896	B
uh advertised in videos like that and i've heard some athletic clubs have	3896	B
uh have machines with a screen like that and that actually the computer	3896	B
uh when- when it shows you're going up a hill it actually makes the bike peddle harder and things like that	3896	B
and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or something like that	3896	B
yeah we bought a uh stepper and uh in the winter time i've tired to use that uh a couple of times a week just because it's so hard to get outside and	3896	B
and and do much in the way of either you- like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it	3896	B
not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there- there is a Y very close i guess i could do that	3896	B
there they they do work you pretty good and	3896	B
um other things i've used that give you pretty good workout uh the rowing machines aren't to bad and	3896	B
one of the best ones although good- for people who aren't used to cross country skiing those Nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people don't like it because they don't feel like they they have good	3896	B
balance i guess it's it it's better if you know how to cross country ski before you use those	3896	B
what's the i've i've heard some other people uh not too happy with President's uh they join and then it seems like that they don't have a lot of good things to say about it	3896	B
oh the-	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
yeah	3896	B
yes i have one Chihuahua that's fourteen years old	3865	B
do you	3865	B
oh uh-huh	3865	B
there's been a time when we had as many as like four pets when our children were growing up and everything you know but they died off one by one and that's it	3865	B
yeah yeah cause they're just they are kind of like a baby you know they're they	3865	B
you have to carry them_1 around you know they can't do a lot	3865	B
right uh but well our cat died two years ago and she was eighteen years old well i am telling you this because you have cats	3865	B
so she lived a long time	3865	B
well kind of both uh	3865	B
she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a little door you know where she could come in	3865	B
but then as she got real old then she went out less and less and then not at all you know the last year or so	3865	B
so uh	3865	B
now what do your cats look like	3865	B
uh-huh	3865	B
oh you have to have his skin i mean his hair-	3865	B
oh	3865	B
oh	3865	B
he doesn't	3865	B
oh my goodness	3865	B
oh yeah i don't think i have ever seen a cat sheared like that	3865	B
oh my i bet	3865	B
do your cats get along well	3865	B
oh now we do a lot uh we our daughters are like in their late twenties and one of them has a Shelty	3865	B
and uh	3865	B
so any time she is traveling or she is working a lot or whatever all kinds of reasons	3865	B
her dog is here a lot you know	3865	B
and uh its a very pretty dog you know looks like a little miniature collie	3865	B
uh-huh that looks just like Lassie except in miniature	3865	B
but uh it is a real pretty little dog but uh i don't know if all of them are that way or not its a real shy dog it really only likes likes my daughter and us you know	3865	B
and uh	3865	B
otherwise it'll go hide	3865	B
yeah well i- yeah now cats it is more usual i think to do that i don't think i have ever known a dog that would this i mean she is so shy that my daughter's roommate	3865	B
yeah yeah they don't uh	3865	B
uh i mean they they know each other and and all that but they i mean they don't play or anything because my my Chihuahua is older she doesn't care any thing about playing and we have promised her that	3865	B
she- we are not going to get any more pets until she is gone she is going to be an only child	3865	B
because every when we got her she was like one of four pets	3865	B
uh	3865	B
right right we had a	3865	B
yeah well of course this one's	3865	B
oh yeah trying to make a long story short we stopped at a service station several months ago and then when we got home i said well you get the dog i will get the baby i had the grandchild in the backseat	3865	B
no dog	3865	B
the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and uh we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and	3865	B
and it took us three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and pictures- with pictures of the dog	3865	B
well somebody looked at the picture on the poster well not poster i made you know xerox copies looked at the picture and said i saw that dog Sunday and he directed me to who	3865	B
-any pets	3865	A
wow	3865	A
i have two cats	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
i bet you're attached to your Chihuahua	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
they're so little and cute	3865	A
yeah they're so little and cute	3865	A
wow yeah eighteen	3865	A
was it an inside or an outside cat	3865	A

uh-huh	3865	A

yeah mine are two characters they're only	3865	A
oh i have one that is a calico and she is not very friendly	3865	A
and i have one that is uh uh yellow and white long hair	3865	A
and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it's the funniest looking thing you have ever seen	3865	A
his fur shaved because he he mats up so bad	3865	A
and he doesn't lick his coat	3865	A
and he gets great big old knots all over him and then when you go pick him up he looks so funny	3865	A
it looks like a cat going out for aerobics	3865	A
cause they don't shave you know their legs	3865	A
no it's real strange	3865	A
they call it a lion cut they shave it all the way to the collar	3865	A
it's really funny he's real friendly he acts like a dog	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
no they don't like each other at all	3865	A
they really don't that is really strange	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
right	3865	A
oh really	3865	A
oh neat	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah well that is what my cats do when company comes they hide	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
shy	3865	A
oh my word that is shy	3865	A
wow	3865	A
does your dog and your daughter's dog get along	3865	A
get in each other's way	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
and now this is her time	3865	A
well those are so cute i just adore them_1	3865	A
do you carry it a lot with you in the car and stuff	3865	A
uh-huh	3865	A
oh my word	3865	A
how'd you find it	3865	A
yeah	3865	A
so have you remodeled your house recently	3823	B
can you do that yourself or do you have it done	3823	B
and then you put putty around the edges	3823	B
i'm i'm impressed that you did that though	3823	B
we um live in our current house about three years and we've only done minor repairs like painting and we did put a new roof on but previously we had owned a eighty year old house in another city	3823	B
and that's where i got my real experience at repairs and so i've replaced many windows	3823	B
but they had wooden they were wooden windows and um i don't know for some reason it the putty seemed easier or something because_1 it blended in	3823	B
well uh we had a lot of it done i can't claim to have done much of it it had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so that they were all um even tiled- what do you- i forgot what you call that where you skim the top and then revarnish	3823	B
and we had it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done	3823	B
we bought when we bought the house uh most of the walls were covered in fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it once that the previous owners had their furniture out it looked pretty bad so when- then we took down the	3823	B
um fabric to find huge plaster cracks	3823	B
not unexpected i suppose but so we repaired a lot of that and then um we didn't do any real major we moved just a couple walls	3823	B
and we put in new bathroom fixture not- not- we kept the fixtures but we put in like a new we did put in a new bathtub and then we sort of bought the antique looking	3823	B
you know the brass plumbing type thing although it was new	3823	B
i like old houses but it is everyone talks about it it's true small bathrooms and small closets	3823	B
uh-huh	3823	B
and plumbing you have to know a lot about plumbing	3823	B
that's right	3823	B
you know we had we ran into an interesting complication um our house it had fifty six windows	3823	B
so we decided in order- with an exorbitant heat bill we decided one way we would attack that we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the attic a a lot of it because we didn't have very much the problem and we never anticipated it was in the summertime	3823	B
the humidity it it would rise and in the stairwell at the top of the stairwell it literally would um the humidity would condense on the walls so that the walls would sort of sweat and	3823	B
when we had an engineer come out and talk he just said that we had over insulated our house so it quote couldn't breath	3823	B
and so the humidity when it would you know that the the highest point would go up there and then and then would condense and it was it was really a problem	3823	B
well not you could i don't know i'm sure over the long term it would and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the in the paint	3823	B
um we put in the first thing we tried we just put in a fan in that area so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help um	3823	B
we actually took a screen uh door window off one of windows to try and allow a little ventilation in that area and then the truth is it then became	3823	B
cooler weather and then we sold our house and i never i always hope that the owners didn't have the same problem next year it's all those things that you don't necessarily want to tell them i don't know i mean we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything you just	3823	B
we gave it our best shot but it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious and you know it's	3823	B
perhaps we overdid it	3823	B
its prettiest features it had beautiful wood molding high ceilings and it had beautiful cut glass french doors	3823	B
and um i suppose that was it's it's prettiest features but- and the and the floors were beautiful	3823	B
but it much like the Swiss Avenue area in Dallas	3823	B
i don't i only have friends there	3823	B
i don't think i have the energy or the money for those sort of beautiful old homes now	3823	B
that's	3823	B
i haven't done too much uh i mostly get stuck doing repairs like broken- replacing a broken window the neighbor threw a rock through the window with his lawn mower	3823	A
yeah yeah that's all there was to it	3823	A
well the screen still has a hole in it so don't be too impressed	3823	A
oh wow	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
yeah	3823	A
yeah what all did you do to your eighty year old home did you totally remodel it or had	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
oh yeah	3823	A
i'll bet yeah	3823	A
oh no	3823	A
right right	3823	A
oh the	3823	A
oh yeah uh-huh	3823	A
that that's right yes i lived for a while in Ohio and i was so impressed with the old homes there that the big old homes but i know people were constantly remodeling them_1 and fixing them_1 up	3823	A
that's right and those lovely old homes had no insulation whatsoever	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
i'll bet it was did it damage the walls	3823	A
um-hum	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
well you gave it your best shot	3823	A
yeah	3823	A
and overdid it	3823	A
i'll bet that eighty year old house had a lot of pretty moldings	3823	A
oh	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
uh-huh	3823	A
no i've just recently helped a friend put up crown molding in the in his guest bedroom	3823	A
up around the ceiling of- course it was a ten foot ceiling in there and it was a rather small room to-	3823	A
um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our money's worth	3805	A
yeah did you see Sixty Minutes last night	3805	A
well they did a thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need and uh	3805	A
it's staggering	3805	A
well there are a lot of things that people i think generally	3805	A
well i think it's interesting to look at um	3805	A
where the money goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is	3805	A
that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with	3805	A
and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us	3805	A
i mean and i think it's gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh	3805	A
yeah right that's your- i think that's the only thing that's gonna change it and-	3805	A
our- our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part	3805	A
um i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society uh there's very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off	3805	A
eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyer's uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting	3805	A
which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special	3805	A
focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve	3805	A
that's not a formula for a better society	3805	A
and the government really plays a role in this	3805	A
i mean well- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful interest-	3805	A
you know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not	3805	A
likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting	3805	A
but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair and when they recognize it's their tax money they're gonna do more about it	3805	A
i think- i'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line	3805	A
an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country they expect	3805	A
opening it for one hour that they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls	3805	A
and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to put- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government	3805	A
like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then	3805	A
i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look	3805	A
do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art	3805	A
well that's the good thing about what is happening because_1 i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us more- you know about the problems	3805	A
so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country	3805	A
over a very long period of time	3805	A
um and uh	3805	A
right	3805	A
yeah	3805	A
well you may be right what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a	3805	A
hey listen if i had my way i wouldn't pay my taxes not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things	3805	B
no i did not i was	3805	B
well how does this grab you how does this grab you	3805	B
um this i- i mean i'm i'm a lady but this i heard this on a Christian program and it was	3805	B
uh about the NEA and that's the National Endowment for Arts and they fund	3805	B
they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money	3805	B
and then it just frosts me terribly	3805	B
absolutely	3805	B
i believe that's true yes	3805	B
that's correct	3805	B
heavy involvement from the public	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
yeah heavy involvement from the public	3805	B
yeah	3805	B
absolutely	3805	B
no it is not it's lopsided very much so	3805	B
uh-huh that's right they pull the strings	3805	B
right the yeah	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
i'm sure they will	3805	B
um-hum	3805	B
uh-huh	3805	B
yes i understand that but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it	3805	B
oh absolutely	3805	B
right absolutely	3805	B
we only see the tip of the iceberg it's only you know there's so much	3805	B
of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture	3805	B
um what	3849	A
things are you looking for in a car what kind of car would you buy	3849	A
for your next purchase	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
well it's funny because_1 i currently also have a Toyota Tercel	3849	A
um	3849	A
when i first got married my my father gave	3849	A
me and my wife a a	3849	A
a used Toyota um Corolla	3849	A
and we used that until we until it's about run into the ground and then we um bought a used um Toyota Tercel i was still a student at the time and um so	3849	A
um you bought what we could afford	3849	A
and	3849	A
i think definitely um now we would also get a a larger car	3849	A
oh	3849	A
very well	3849	A
um	3849	A
it um	3849	A
did very well i mean	3849	A
uh yeah it was about a hundred and fifty thousand and it may have gone further but um	3849	A
it was very reliable though- for us though	3849	A
um	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
oh that's to be expected i would think	3849	A
hopefully- hopefully it just doesn't happen at a a bad time i mean when you're far away from anything or something	3849	A
uh-huh did you buy it new	3849	A
uh-huh	3849	A
i see but well sounds like it's been a good deal for you	3849	A
um	3849	A
another thing i may consider the main thing i look for in a car is reliability	3849	A
and	3849	A
um i just go by what my dad says he's a mechanic and i remember growing up and and but he's always- never wanted to spend a lot on a car because_1 i grew up in a fairly large family six kids and we just didn't have a lot of money to spend on cars	3849	A
so um i remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that and think they're the most unreliable cars that ever existed i mean ours broke down all the time luckily my dad was mechanic and he could fix them_1 but i remember	3849	A
he said- he said he would never buy um a foreign car but then in nineteen eighty he bought a used Toyota Corolla	3849	A
and i mean didn't even spend very much money for it i don't think he spent more than five hundred dollars for it but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased	3849	A
and he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time	3849	A
and so um	3849	A
but i don't know my feeling is that American cars to keep up at all are becoming more reliable also so i may consider buying um an American made car	3849	A
my next my next purchase	3849	A
that's true	3849	A
i have a cousin- yeah one of my cousins	3849	A
is trying to tell convince me that um	3849	A
the American made cars are becoming reliable- reliable but	3849	A
uh i'm not i'm not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good	3849	A
um and reliable that that i've i've used	3849	A
oh	3849	A
i'm in Iowa City Iowa very small town and i don't i don't know if there's even uh more than a	3849	A
one or two a month i mean um that's that that's not a big consideration here and i just moved from Utah where i that's where i was going to school before and um	3849	A
also there um there's i've never had that concern	3849	A
um so i'm not really i'm not really sure	3849	A
well right now i have a uh small Toyota Tercel	3849	B
and i think next time i want something just a little bit bigger uh perhaps mid size i really don't don't like the the real big cars	3849	B
i'm thinking about maybe a Volvo	3849	B
you do	3849	B
uh-huh	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
right	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
how did your uh Corolla hold up	3849	B
for real	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
do you remember how many miles you had on it in the at the end	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
my my Tercel now has a hundred and forty six thousand miles on it	3849	B
and i really haven't had any trouble out of it except the alternator went out at about a hundred and twenty six thousand miles i think	3849	B
right	3849	B
right	3849	B
right and um it's really been great i have had no problems with it you know except little little minor things like you know belts and course you know	3849	B
actually i didn't i bought it from um Hertz Rent A Car and it had like twenty six thousand miles on it when i bought it	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
right	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
yeah	3849	B
uh-huh	3849	B
wow	3849	B
right	3849	B
uh	3849	B
wow	3849	B
yeah i'm trying to consider that uh that could do to the plight of General Motors and all of that	3849	B
i'm really trying trying to consider	3849	B
but i don't know i- i- i don't want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs	3849	B
have you heard that uh or do you know anything about the foreign cars being easier to steal than the uh the American cars	3849	B
because_1 there's a lot of of um car theft going going on in Dallas right now i don't know about in your area	3849	B
um-hum	3849	B
yeah	3849	B
yes uh we live uh right to the base of the Wasatch Front so uh uh as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever	3895	A
well- well uh sometimes we did most of the time we'd we'd put up tents and we'd go up and stay for a week or	3895	A
uh weekend or go up into uh Yellowstone Park and and camp in the campgrounds up there	3895	A
but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and uh some real good memories how about_1 your experiences on camping uh what have you	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
well that sounds uh	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
oh wow	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
all those fun things huh	3895	A
yes i'll say well we uh when we were up in uh by Yellowstone Park we had uh moose that went through our campground and we had a a bear once that went through uh-huh black bear and then we	3895	A
uh we've seen a lot of rattle snakes uh in our camping trips	3895	A
and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but	3895	A
i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and	3895	A
no no no he we uh didn't bother it and uh everything was fine but uh	3895	A
it's uh camping has really uh been a a great part of our life and now we're we're older all of our kids are gone and we don't uh	3895	A
uh fact last year was the first year i didn't go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and i didn't first time in uh fifty four years that i hadn't gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so	3895	A
but anyway it uh	3895	A
yeah when the grandkids uh get a little bit older then we'll we'll we'll do that again	3895	A
oh uh-huh	3895	A
uh-huh well i would uh it's not like camping in a way but yet it is you're still uh on the	3895	A
right	3895	A
yes uh we got uh where we had a a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we we took up and	3895	A
uh when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did uh pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and uh	3895	A
speaking about_1 tornados up in Yellowstone uh one went through there usually they don't have such things here but	3895	A
it took down pine trees quite a swath and uh we were there right after that happened but uh	3895	A
uh those tornados i guess are uh pretty scary things	3895	A
um-hum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in Yellowstone and it's uh maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but uh and it happened and uh that was	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
uh-huh	3895	A
um-hum	3895	A
oh it is it's it's beautiful we've spent a lot of time up there and that but that's a long ways to pull a trailer	3895	A
yeah	3895	A
no-	3895	A
well do you go camping Glen	3895	B
by camping	3895	B
you you mean really roughing it	3895	B
oh but that was	3895	B
uh well i've our children were growing up also uh we had a boat and we'd	3895	B
go camping on the long weekends uh Memorial Day Fourth of July Labor Day	3895	B
and uh we went with some good friends and we'd get as many you know involved as we could and	3895	B
so our kids really grew up all through uh you might say junior high and high school camping and uh	3895	B
we've really had a good time doing it um we went to a lake called Lake Tawakoni uh it's just kind of east and south of here in Texas	3895	B
and uh	3895	B
we camped outside one time we had a tornado come through our campgrounds it was kind of interesting we had snakes and armadillos and	3895	B
all the fun things that that make memories	3895	B
a bear oh oh	3895	B
oh	3895	B
uh-huh	3895	B
didn't didn't mind you being there a bit huh	3895	B
oh	3895	B
first time huh well	3895	B
maybe you'll get a chance to go again	3895	B
take them well we kind of gave up camping about three four years ago to and we built a lake house	3895	B
and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house	3895	B
well	3895	B
we're we're still outside but we we we figured we're getting a little too old to rough it as much as we used to	3895	B
i didn't know they did yeah	3895	B
oh	3895	B
i guess most- you know there's probably not any part of the country that doesn't experience them every once in a while	3895	B
i bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we we went up we pulled a trailer out there from Illinois um	3895	B
when uh probably about nineteen seventy four i'm trying- no no no no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to Texas	3895	B
and uh we had like a sixteen foot trailer that uh we pulled behind the car	3895	B
and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i- i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer	3895	B
but we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that	3895	B
yeah it was and uh we needless to say we haven't- we haven't done it again pulling the trailer is not the our favorite thing to do	3895	B
so okay so what is the subject now	3872	B
okay well let me tell you about our our situation um we have two girls uh one is twelve one is uh	3872	B
is eleven and i've got uh two sons that are um	3872	B
six and three	3872	B
and uh between the four	3872	B
uh my two girls play a lot of soccer and we travel a lot with them	3872	B
and they're either practicing or playing and and it is really tough to fit everything in	3872	B
and uh you know i'm not real sure what your situation is if you you have any kids that are still at home but	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
oh is that right	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
oh	3872	B
you bet	3872	B
it sure makes a big difference doesn't it	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
it sure is	3872	B
we have uh in fact we- this this past um Christmas	3872	B
we went out to California we- uh both my girls were involved in in tournaments out there so went out there we spent Christmas with uh my wife's family out there in in California and then um	3872	B
we drove out to or down to Southern California and had the tournament we went to Disneyland as a family and and just kind of you know spent time together that way	3872	B
yeah	3872	B
you bet my wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful	3872	B
to be blessed	3872	B
yeah i know that means a you'd mean a lot to uh to Brian he's a he's a heck of a nice guy boy- i really enjoy uh being friends with him he's	3872	B
is that right	3872	B
when did he find time to learn how to do brakes he just helped me do my brakes	3872	B
yeah he is	3872	B
yes	3872	B
uh-huh	3872	B
well that's great yeah um my work uh uh fortunately my work doesn't take me away from from this area so	3872	B
i have uh i have some time i own my own business out here so i have some time just just spent with them you know whenever the time uh whenever they need me but um	3872	B
i- i know that there's quite a few people in our family that uh or in our you know in our area that um	3872	B
that work outside and and they have a even tougher time trying to uh schedule time with their families	3872	B
okay i'm i'm not sure if our time's up or my phone just went out of out of whack i think that was just my phone	3872	B
well they'll come back on and tell us when the time is up yeah it they should be another couple of minutes so	3872	B
uh-huh oh yeah	3872	B
well i think that's it that's probably more important than anything else and-	3872	B
it's on the the time that we spend with our children	3872	A
okay	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
uh we just uh well we have the one that uh has left	3872	A
but he was here a year ago and uh he was involved in wrestling- wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is uh	3872	A
he's a doctor and he was uh All State in wrestling	3872	A
and then uh my last son that just left home is All State in wrestling so we had two in our family but we had a lot of participation with them_1 and i know what you're talking about where you it's difficult to find time but i	3872	A
i- i feel it's very important that you support the kids as much as you can you and uh uh the spouse because uh when uh well both sons uh when they were wrestling uh they would kind of look up	3872	A
to see if we were in the audience and the that's the last they pay any attention to us -until after the game is over right and the wrestling match	3872	A
and uh we really enjoyed it uh to be involved with our our uh children and i think it's very important that's something that	3872	A
the parents today and- and- and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with with church and everything else that you're doing	3872	A
but uh that's where a family relationship is really built and uh it's uh then they have	3872	A
um-hum	3872	A
uh-huh	3872	A
well super	3872	A
well those are things that they'll they'll never forget and uh they know they're loved when when that takes place	3872	A
and that you're supporting them there are so many families that i know about today that they just don't take uh time to do anything with their children	3872	A
oh good good well we're gonna try to get down to uh hopefully for his uh uh the oldest one's uh	3872	A
baptism and then the grandson's uh our youngest to get his uh to the blessing but i don't know whether we can make it or not we're gonna give it a shot but that's coming up	3872	A
i appreciate that he was a super son and when he was wrestling uh we had two sons wrestling and we one week we went to twelve wrestling matches in one week	3872	A
oh he he's very talented in all kinds of things uh he's not like his dad he can do about anything and uh we really miss him being in in Texas	3872	A
so anyway	3872	A
um-hum well that's super	3872	A
um-hum yep well be sure and tell Brian hello and it's been a pleasure talking to you sounds like our time's up and uh give him the the best from him his dad	3872	A
oh oh i see okay	3872	A
i've i've this the first call so i don't know what happens when the time's up	3872	A
oh i see okay fine	3872	A
and course church involvement i think is very important too uh that with parents uh supporting their children in in taking them to Church and going with them_1	3872	A
and that's- that's another activity that uh time is spent and	3872	A
yes i'm still here	3861	A
well that	3861	A
no i think i think it's on i'm i'm so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work the other day people are wondering how to choose a college	3861	A
and i was wondering how what did your parents do to help you choose a college	3861	A
oh	3861	A
oh yeah	3861	A
oh	3861	A
hum	3861	A
so you got to choose a college twice	3861	A
good grief	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
um	3861	A
yeah	3861	A
that was the same way in in my family of course my parents were divorced so it was just mother and my grandparents	3861	A
but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do	3861	A
and i got a a co-op	3861	A
deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out	3861	A
New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology	3861	A
and that choice	3861	A
yeah it was but men out women numbered the women about twenty or thirty to one	3861	A
but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available	3861	A
and it	3861	A
yeah yeah	3861	A
but then i	3861	A
my next choice in college was hey i move back with- home with mom and i i went to the local university to get my grade point back up	3861	A
so a decent school would let me in	3861	A
uh oh	3861	B
are you still there	3861	B
oh i know what it was the answering machine must have run out of	3861	B
i i heard something click and i was like oh no it disconnected us	3861	B
uh-huh	3861	B
well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said	3861	B
um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know Dad said well you know you're a smart kid so	3861	B
you're going to college and you're going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know	3861	B
the different professions and i was kind of like i didn't even know you know	3861	B
i had no clues so i said dad-	3861	B
well i can't stand the sight of blood so a doctor is out and uh i'm not i can't do math so a lot of stuff is out um	3861	B
i didn't think i'd be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a lawyer because i think they help people	3861	B
boy was i stupid	3861	B
so Dad said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer	3861	B
so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff my dad kind of said well uh what's the best law school in the country	3861	B
and all his friends told him Harvard and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too	3861	B
so i was like okay fine	3861	B
so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it	3861	B
you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through Radcliff because	3861	B
used to Harvard was for the boys and Radcliff was for the girls	3861	B
and even though they were combined	3861	B
you know even though they had to let women in Harvard you still had to apply through Radcliff so	3861	B
i did all this and uh a Radcliff alum here in Dallas did my interview and basically Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system	3861	B
and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know	3861	B
wasp type person so i'm not really	3861	B
you know they had this minority recruitment thing	3861	B
so and sure enough about two weeks before school started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl	3861	B
and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start the next day so	3861	B
University of Texas was where my dad went to school and luckily it's kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes the day after i registered	3861	B
yeah by myself	3861	B
i mean my parents didn't really you know my dad was the first	3861	B
well my mom	3861	B
they were the first people in their families that had been to college	3861	B
which i know like people from the east coast	3861	B
colleges are all around you you know	3861	B
and so everybody goes to college or it's more normal i think because_1 a lot of my friends that are from the east coast you know everybody in their family's been to college but out here you know in fact my mother hasn't really been to college college they had a junior college	3861	B
that was fairly close by and and so she that's all she ever did was go to junior college	3861	B
just you know two year college and and got her degree but you know then my dad went back to school and finished school and went to professional school	3861	B
but that was after my brother and i were already little kids so nobody in my family really knew how to advise me	3861	B
oh yeah	3861	B
well where did you go to school in New Mexico	3861	B
i bet that was neat	3861	B
wow	3861	B
yeah	3861	B
that is really critical these days i think	3861	B
oh yeah	3861	B
yeah yeah that's about all i get a chance for between that and um uh Bible study as often as i can that's about the bulk of it	3846	A
not a whole lot of chances otherwise	3846	A
okay um officially a junior right now um	3846	A
well right now i'm taking a a uh my fourth semester of of electronics dealing mostly with uh uh MOSFET and JFET transistors	3846	A
and	3846	A
well okay they they're are gonna uh computer engineering	3846	A
okay i am getting some programming- right right now i'm taking my first semester in in	3846	A
yeah yeah well with this- well they classify it as computer engineering technology so i'm getting a fair amount of programming as well as electronics	3846	A
uh it depends on which language they're working with um	3846	A
right now i'm taking C i've got three semesters in Pascal behind me	3846	A
uh that we're working with what what they called standard uh ANSI C	3846	A
um i'm not real sure what the difference is gonna be between C and C	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
um-hum	3846	A
okay well what we're working with is	3846	A
uh i don't remember the author's name	3846	A
used to be i read a good deal of uh science fiction	3846	A
um Asimov um Clark uh	3846	A
there's uh	3846	A
the big one was Asimov his he's his stuff was easiest to find	3846	A
what got me started in the first place was uh my brother-in-law gave me a set the uh um Foundation Trilogy	3846	A
back junior a year and- a when i -was a in- in junior high school he gave it to me	3846	A
oh yeah and he's come up with what three more books	3846	A
uh parts of it i got three parts of it	3846	A
yeah yeah wait a minute matter of fact i did read i- i Robot	3846	A
I Robot yeah that's pretty light reading for science fiction those kind of things	3846	A
yes he does- well the uh Foundation Trilogy is directly connected to I Robot	3846	A
as a matter of fact his last book Foundation and Earth	3846	A
they made the finally made the connection	3846	A
that uh	3846	A
um leader robot whatever his i don't remember his name now	3846	A
anyway he's still going in the Foundation- at the uh in Foundation and Earth they meet up with him	3846	A
he's on a base on the moon and somehow or another earth has been so utterly polluted with uh uh uh radioactive fallout that it's utterly inhabitable- uninhabitable even though it's been several million years	3846	A
uh several hundred thousand years anyway	3846	A
so it's- it's utterly uninhabitable	3846	A
oh yeah	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
yeah	3846	A
yeah yeah well i- i got started on student late	3846	A
i was thirty three when i started to college for the first time	3846	A
oh yeah yeah i'd i'd been an auto mechanic for twenty years	3846	A
started about twelve years old for my father but uh decided you know i- i had a pretty good idea that wasn't what i wanted to do any more	3846	A
no didn't go through military um	3846	A
uh	3846	A
uh not familiar with it	3846	A
i assume most of the books you're reading these days since you're a student have to do with studies	3846	B
the uh	3846	B
what year are you in in computer science	3846	B
yeah and so the course work you're doing is what	3846	B
i thought you said computer science was your major	3846	B
oh computer engineering okay that's yeah okay	3846	B
well	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
um-hum	3846	B
right so who's books do you use for programming	3846	B
well tell me what language we're taking these days	3846	B
taking C okay is that just standard C or C plus plus	3846	B
yes right um-hum	3846	B
well C plus plus is object oriented and there is uh quite a bit of difference and it quite- often has- you need a book up front to tell you about uh precompiling and that sort of thing and then it normally does a little shuffle up front	3846	B
and then runs on ANSI C or some other similar dialect of C so it does uh some preprocessing to begin with who's book do you use in Pascal	3846	B
so Isaac Asimov for example	3846	B
yeah Arthur Clark	3846	B
yeah yeah	3846	B
oh yeah that's fantastic	3846	B
oh yeah it's hard to put down those	3846	B
have you ever read Asimov's I Robot	3846	B
i have actually gone back and is- is long enough that was the first science fiction book i ever read was I Robot	3846	B
and it	3846	B
and it was so good i went back and read it again because_1 Asimov knows how to string things together you know	3846	B
yeah oh yeah right	3846	B
um-hum um-hum	3846	B
uh	3846	B
i can't remember the name either but	3846	B
uh	3846	B
huh	3846	B
i'll be darned	3846	B
right	3846	B
oh yeah	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
well while i was working i got enough i read on the job a lot of course just like a student does because_1 you're learning all the time in research so i read-	3846	B
i uh	3846	B
started uh long enough ago that uh vacuum tubes were still in business when i was a young engineer you know so i had to continually upgrade my education and	3846	B
yeah so you knew what you wanted to do yeah yeah	3846	B
right	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
yeah	3846	B
have you been in the military at all	3846	B
oh	3846	B
so probably- so probably the things that i enjoy reading relative to military you would enjoy The Web Web Griffin stuff uh which uh has to do with the military and other right wing things-	3846	B
well we have Bermuda grass here do you have that there	3812	B
it's a kind of grass that dies in the winter time	3812	B
do you live in an apartment or a house	3812	B
so you probably don't do any lawn care	3812	B
and fertilize and such but we ran in some into some money trouble so we do all of that ourselves now does the grass die there in Iowa in the winter time	3812	B
is everything brown	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
so right now we do nothing because_1 it's brown and it doesn't grow until	3812	B
later on in the spring	3812	B
but	3812	B
no huh-uh it just goes dormant and then it starts it's you know it rejuvenates itself in the springtime there are people that uh	3812	B
that reseed in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like that i can't remember exactly what it's called	3812	B
and so it's green in the winter but you have to seed over all of this other stuff that's	3812	B
there and it's kind of hard to grow it's kind of foolish as far as i'm concerned	3812	B
so did you grow up in Iowa	3812	B
oh	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff	3812	B
huh	3812	B
huh	3812	B
huh	3812	B
we have a garden here but in Texas it's really hard to grow a garden because it's so	3812	B
hot and the sun is so intense that you know the	3812	B
to have a garden here	3812	B
did you enjoy it did you like to do it when you were there	3812	B
huh	3812	B
yeah you had a compost pile huh	3812	B
how many how many were in your family	3812	B
was it something that the kids mostly took care of	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
what was your favorite thing	3812	B
to eat	3812	B
uh-huh	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
you'd think so	3812	B
so what took you to Iowa	3812	B
uh-huh	3812	B
where did you graduate	3812	B
i knew it i'm a member too that's why i was when you were talking about your garden and everything and your mom canning i thought this guy's got to be got to have roots there somewhere	3812	B
no i grew up in California	3812	B
no it was more in the city but we did have a um a little garden out in the back because_1 anything grows there you just stick it in the ground and it it grows	3812	B
yeah	3812	B
yeah do you have in- in your apartment-	3812	B
so Cathy what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work	3812	A
um i don't know exactly what that is	3812	A
um i don't	3812	A
yeah i live in an apartment	3812	A
yeah that's that's actually correct	3812	A
um it turns brown yeah	3812	A
guess it freezes and everything so	3812	A
so does that mean you have to replant each year or	3812	A
i see	3812	A
no i'm actually from uh	3812	A
uh the Seattle area we lived outside outside of the city- in the country and uh we have five acres of land up against a hillside where i grew up and so we did have a garden about a one a half acre garden pretty big size	3812	A
and grew standard things like corn beans and we had some trees apple trees fruit trees you know and apple trees and	3812	A
oh yeah	3812	A
did lots of canning and	3812	A
we even	3812	A
made an annual trip out to eastern Washington	3812	A
Yakima area to get uh	3812	A
peaches and things like that to can in addition to the the fruit we got out of our own garden	3812	A
uh-huh	3812	A
oh yeah i enjoyed um	3812	A
working in the garden	3812	A
um	3812	A
my dad was a big um	3812	A
fan of organic gardening	3812	A
and so when we um did our garbage and stuff we separated all the banana peels and egg shells and stuff that	3812	A
yeah	3812	A
yeah and	3812	A
always picked a different place in the garden to dump it out	3812	A
had our own rototiller and	3812	A
rough even though it was a large plot we used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was quite a bit of work for all of us but we five kids and	3812	A
uh	3812	A
six kids altogether	3812	A
actually dad did more than his share but uh we always had our our assignments to help out	3812	A
so and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the canning and other things	3812	A
um oh to eat oh um	3812	A
the our big crops were were	3812	A
green beans and corn and i guess i liked the corn	3812	A
and so now that i'm in Iowa i should be get be able to get lots of uh	3812	A
corn on the cob huh	3812	A
uh	3812	A
i just graduated-	3812	A
i	3812	A
i'm working at the University of Iowa	3812	A
um on a post doctoral fellowship i just graduated	3812	A
out west with a PhD in physics	3812	A
uh Brigham Young University	3812	A
uh	3812	A
uh	3812	A
yes and uh	3812	A
so are you originally from Texas	3812	A
i see	3812	A
did- did your family have a farm or were you more in the city	3812	A
uh-huh	3812	A
oh yeah	3812	A
yeah my wife is from southern California and their family has a an orange tree and a lemon tree out back	3812	A
and they grow a few things they tried- tomatoes and stuff but not they don't have very you know just a small- small backyard so there's not too much else they could do there	3812	A
okay	3820	B
oh boy you're a real world traveler here	3820	B
all right	3820	B
oh yeah um emperor or yeah	3820	B
yeah that was a	3820	B
well my wife and i are right now saving for a trip to to England	3820	B
we would like to stay about a month uh	3820	B
well we do have some friends that we can stay at their place for a while or as long as we want actually but it's you know it's in the southern part so but we want us to go all over the countryside	3820	B
that's our next big vacation we've got planned and just a few days in the London itself is all we're interested in there	3820	B
but mostly to this date uh our vacations have been more like uh anywhere where there's not too many tourists	3820	B
i hate resorts	3820	B
and things like that i like to go where you can get out by yourself in the mountains done a lot of camping in New Mexico and uh Colorado	3820	B
and one time we even toured Iowa my wife is from Iowa	3820	B
but actually the southern part and uh she'd never really seen a lot of the different northern places and just the lot of the little towns and so we drove around went to the Humana Colonies things like that	3820	B
we really i think she enjoyed it a a lot because she knew more of the history than course than i did of Iowa but	3820	B
it was uh it was interesting	3820	B
here in Texas we live in the middle of Texas it's hard to get out of Texas on a driving trip	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
right we had- had a we went to Mexico City once by ourselves	3820	B
uh mainly because it was just something we could afford to do and	3820	B
we heard it was interesting well we just had a real awful time because we didn't speak Spanish i don't think that would have helped us any anyway	3820	B
it was just a miserable vacation and we decided you know we'll never go anywhere where they don't speak English or somebody that can't help us	3820	B
it was by the end of that week we felt like everybody was out to get us	3820	B
and that sort of thing and we weren't having the fun we thought we would	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
yeah	3820	B
our last	3820	B
major vacation was uh well we had to go to Iowa to see some relatives because sickness in the family so we took that in for a few days and then we went to a uh	3820	B
to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky	3820	B
and uh it's a it's been rebuilt and we stayed there for three days and it was just kind of neat because we really like Shaker things and we were able to take our dog with us and he stayed with us and	3820	B
it was just the thrill of our life to it was early fall and Kentucky was beautiful that time of the year anyway	3820	B
um	3820	A
what have been some well i'll start out with some of my my vacations um	3820	A
um when i graduated from high school um my uh band my jazz band and we visited Europe i visited Germany and Austria um Italy	3820	A
uh Switzerland	3820	A
and that was pretty fun i also have visited South America	3820	A
and just this last summer one of my favorite vacations is i went to China	3820	A
so uh i i we my wife and i when we went to China we visited the Great Wall and uh the Forbidden City	3820	A
um	3820	A
the Forbidden City is uh right there Tiananmen Square is right in front of it and so that's where all the	3820	A
killings occurred not too long- couple years ago and uh also the Forbidden City if you saw what was that one movie that was really famous	3820	A
uh	3820	A
The Last Emperor yeah that was filmed in the Forbidden City so we had to see that when we went anyway	3820	A
oh that sounds fun	3820	A
you'll need to save for that unless you have some friends there you're going to stay with because_1	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
uh-huh yeah they're not too far from here	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
yeah got to go a long ways uh yeah we also don't like to particularly go to tourist spots fact we usually choose to go places where	3820	A
we at least for part of our trip will be visiting someone and uh even when my wife is well	3820	A
and my graduate program that i was in we knew some people who were in Beijing	3820	A
and so uh	3820	A
we were able to stay with them for part of the time in fact they spoke English very well and and helped us around to see some of the places	3820	A
and even when we went to South America uh	3820	A
uh	3820	A
we knew- there were people contacts we had there	3820	A
so	3820	A
uh	3820	A
but most people that i that i uh met you know at the university and so uh	3820	A
it makes a big difference to us we like to go for go on a trip with someone who's from the area because i don't know i've i'm afraid especially if i don't know the language	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
uh-huh	3820	A
yeah	3820	A
it really makes a difference because i know even when we went to China when we crossed the border we went over to Hong Kong we were so relieved it was so fun to be uh	3820	A
you know it seemed like returning to civilization and where a lot of people spoke English and uh just the general living conditions were were somewhat higher also so it was uh	3820	A
yeah	3804	B
yeah well i've had them_1 uh where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people um and i had help with them_1 um and	3804	B
part of them_1 i did were like a buffet and uh it i had uh	3804	B
just different uh side dishes and appetizers and one of them_1 that that i'd remembered was uh	3804	B
some uh sausage hors d'oeuvres and uh	3804	B
anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh	3804	B
cups of Bisquick and uh	3804	B
sausage oh like a a Owens mild you can i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to yeah and uh you	3804	B
put that in and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and	3804	B
make- make it all doughy and then like i just put them_1 in little balls and bake them_1 for about fifteen minutes and they are so good	3804	B
yeah it's making me hungry for them_1 right now	3804	B
have you yeah	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
i i've used that quite a bit and it and it seems to work real well um and uh um	3804	B
when i've had so many people uh to- to feed like i'd try to do a ham	3804	B
an a turkey and and	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
um-hum	3804	B
no what	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
oh i'll bet	3804	B
yeah i'll have to try that	3804	B
i like things that are easy and and uh	3804	B
nutritious	3804	B
uh-huh	3804	B
i know i know well thank God for microwaves you know	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
um-hum um-hum	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
right well i don't anymore yeah it's been a few years and and uh	3804	B
i don't have you know over a couple either and and uh i try to	3804	B
uh have everything all ready and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where i don't spend- spend all my time in the kitchen	3804	B
and uh spaghetti and	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
oh yeah	3804	B
i like it too	3804	B
i do too	3804	B
um-hum	3804	B
yeah well have you had any good ideas yet oh okay	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
yeah	3804	B
and that's the way to do it too	3804	B
i think it's you know what's i think is so nice is that	3804	B
in this day and time that we can have good food	3804	B
that's good for you and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen and and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it	3804	B
well	3804	B
okay Cindy you there	3804	A
okay what kind of dinner parties have you had	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
uh-huh	3804	A
uh-huh	3804	A
whatever you like huh yeah	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
hm	3804	A
oh that sounds delicious yeah	3804	A
yeah you know i've made like little Swedish meatballs but they're just made out of the beef you know	3804	A
and uh with spices and things in them_1 but never anything mixed with Bisquick	3804	A
um-hum hm	3804	A
yeah that's my that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time	3804	A
you know i've uh i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here	3804	A
uh which i had uh things like that but i always cooked them_1 ahead of time and then i just sliced them	3804	A
you know and had macaroni salad with uh shrimp in it have you ever had that	3804	A
get some fresh little fresh shrimp and it's in your macaroni salad that you make	3804	A
the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor	3804	A
yeah i don't like the can but the fresh you know	3804	A
yeah that was really good	3804	A
yeah right right but uh at uh Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know	3804	A
which is kind of hard because you got so many people and then by time you pass everything around it seems like everything on your plate's cold	3804	A
so but anyhow i	3804	A
yeah you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know	3804	A
but uh other than that i- i don't have too- too many parties uh you know i have like maybe just a couple- another couple over for dinner	3804	A
but uh other than than than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of people like except except at Christmas and i have my family	3804	A
um-hum	3804	A
yeah right right	3804	A
yeah that's easy i always like to have that too you know everybody seems to like that too	3804	A
no everybody likes that	3804	A
and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast that's what i love	3804	A
with my	3804	A
and um other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what goes- next weekend when the Super Bowl's on	3804	A
i've asked a couple people to come over and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that	3804	A
no not yet no and i you know i don't want to have to come away from the TV i want something that i can just take them_1 and serve them_1 while they're sitting in front of the TV	3804	A
you know so i'll think of something just that- that we can munch on over there you know	3804	A
and they can just fill- fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down	3804	A
yeah yeah	3804	A
yeah preparing it right	3804	A
oh it sure does	3804	A
well when i was brought up you know we didn't	3804	A
hello	3807	A
how you doing	3807	A
hi Holly uh my name's Lee i'm calling from uh Plano Texas	3807	A
oh okay	3807	A
well i guess we're supposed to talk about	3807	A
oh it's been beautiful today yeah	3807	A
snow no not over here	3807	A
just a little bit north of us though yeah just a little bit north of- it's been beautiful today probably uh high fifties- fifties low fourties- maybe you know low sixties	3807	A
oh it's beautiful how about_1 there	3807	A
oh good good you've had enough uh water for a while	3807	A
well uh	3807	A
yeah we better let me push one here	3807	A
okay	3807	A
what's that	3807	A
let's see i've got four kids and they uh our TVs are usually	3807	A
are usually yeah uh ruled by the kids so we watch all the usuals uh Cosby you know Cosby Kids and	3807	A
uh we yeah we like to watch comedy	3807	A
um uh we uh our kids are so involved in sports and stuff that our nights are not- we're not home	3807	A
very much at night so	3807	A
um what are yours	3807	A
oh is that right	3807	A
yeah- oh isn't that a great show that is the funniest show	3807	A
oh that is the funniest show	3807	A
um	3807	A
yeah	3807	A
uh-huh	3807	A
now they've got one tonight with Susan Day	3807	A
yeah that that looks intriguing it looks kind of it would be	3807	A
well	3807	A
we- we we've got uh enough TVs that that whoever wants to you know watch uh if whatever- yeah the majority stays in the front room and watches and whoever wants to watch something else can go somewhere else and watch it so	3807	A
uh yeah i think my wife and i are probably gonna just stick in our room and and watch that one	3807	A
it looks it- it looks intriguing to me so but uh	3807	A
yeah how about_1 during the day do you do you watch any of the soaps or you watch any of the talk shows	3807	A
you work okay	3807	A
uh-huh	3807	A
yeah	3807	A
the old shows	3807	A
oh yeah oh yeah yeah	3807	A
you know i was watching um i took the day off today and i was watching uh Donahue and he had uh	3807	A
past child stars	3807	A
yes uh he had uh Danny Bonaducci from uh The Partridge Family he had uh uh Jay North from- uh you know Dennis the Menace	3807	A
and he had Spanky McFarland	3807	A
and he had uh you know three or four others uh and they were talking about uh child stars and how they were mistreated as you know when they were growing up and uh	3807	A
yeah and they were talking about this uh Macaulay kid you know from Home Alone	3807	A
uh and they asked a real interesting question you know that- what if the kid	3807	A
you know all of a sudden said well i don't want to do this anymore	3807	A
you know and i guess his dad is the uh is also his agent	3807	A
yeah but- you know i mean if i- i guess i'm i- i kind of put myself in in his dad's shoes if if my kid was making	3807	A
you know twenty five million dollars a year and he came to me and said i don't want to do this anymore i mean what do you do what do you say you know	3807	A
yeah that's right so he- -he -he	3807	A
yeah so uh	3807	A
it i wouldn't think so you know i guess yeah i'm kind of sympathetic to the to the young kids that are involved in that and	3807	A
and uh but as far as shows uh you know my kids like to watch all the cartoons on Saturdays	3807	A
yeah	3807	A
yeah yeah uh	3807	A

yeah	3807	B
okay_1	3838	A
oh well actually i'm from California and before then i was from Utah so	3838	A
well i grew up in California and then i went to school in Utah and i got married there and we stayed there for a while and then now we're in Utah- Iowa	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
oh	3838	A
um	3838	A
well i crochet and i do water color and i um sew and i do fabric painting	3838	A
um i've done some cross stitching	3838	A
i haven't tried any needlepoint yet how about_1 you	3838	A
oh right	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
uh-huh	3838	A
oh God	3838	A
oh yeah well those take a lot of time i only can do things that are pretty fast because	3838	A
we just um got our baby last year and i just	3838	A
don't have the patience to just- you know be some uh-huh	3838	A
um	3838	A
um	3838	A
um our baby's quilt it was a pre	3838	A
like the design i just went around the design in the quilt i didn't piece it or anything like that	3838	A
but uh	3838	A
uh-huh and just-	3838	A
um	3838	A
i put it on the frame the quilting frame	3838	A
have you are you familiar with that yeah okay	3838	A
oh my God	3838	A
well i haven't done tons of them_1	3838	A
but um i used to do more before um	3838	A
before i had before we got our baby but	3838	A
uh-huh	3838	A
yeah exactly	3838	A
well one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just	3838	A
make a T-shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make	3838	A
um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with	3838	A
Heat and Bond or whatever and then paint around it and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first	3838	A
and then i paint around it so you can't see the stitching as much	3838	A
does- does that make sense to you	3838	A
so	3838	A
oh	3838	A
oh sure uh-huh	3838	A
oh really	3838	A
oh	3838	A
well	3838	A
yeah someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways and i've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even	3838	A
even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps	3838	A
and um	3838	A
well if you're from Iowa you must be very artsy-craftsy everyone i've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands	3838	B
i didn't know anyone ever moved from California to Kansas- Iowa	3838	B
i'm teasing only because i'm from Indiana i really liked i like the Midwest	3838	B
but i married a Texan and they have a way of dragging you back home	3838	B
anyway we're supposed to be talking about crafts do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands like knitting or	3838	B
oh you do a lot then do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching	3838	B
um actually i i'm pretty untalented i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um	3838	B
but i- i don't know somehow i- i don't have the time anymore	3838	B
but i have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their um bags some their most recent uh needle craft	3838	B
and in December everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings	3838	B
yes	3838	B
is this your first baby have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets	3838	B
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself or	3838	B
how- how did you make a quilt	3838	B
uh-huh	3838	B
but you actually hand quilted it yourself	3838	B
did did you need a loom or were you able- was it small enough that you could just hold it	3838	B
uh-huh	3838	B
but um	3838	B
my again my mother back in Indiana we had a quilting frame in our basement and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself	3838	B
um yes which i was always amazed i have one of them_1 um but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work	3838	B
have you think children you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children	3838	B
i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and	3838	B
are are wonderful and and they'll wear them_1 once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear your	3838	B
oh yes i think it's very clever it's uh funny that you said that for Christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful Christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely	3838	B
but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it so i had- i went and bought just some	3838	B
cloth glue and glued it all back and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable and i	3838	B
but it's so i'm familiar with that but i think you're very clever to um sew around the edges i think gluing alone	3838	B
certainly would if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges	3838	B
uh yeah something about the school system here	3841	B
well then i'll uh i'll walk softly	3841	B
yeah	3841	B
what school system does she teach in	3841	B
oh wow	3841	B
well i think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than uh	3841	B
than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program	3841	B
um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school	3841	B
because they've taken it the best teachers and the best students they've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district	3841	B
and uh put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult but once you're in uh they have they have self-paced programs	3841	B
and so you have students that wanna learn and uh you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically uh	3841	B
there's probably some discrimination if you wanna say that uh because most of the people that are in the academy system	3841	B
uh are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system	3841	B
and most of that's not all true but i'm saying a large percentage of them_1 are and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does	3841	B
and so there's i think that uh that's my justification for saying that	3841	B
the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it	3841	B
don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you	3841	B
yeah	3841	B
yeah i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the South Dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education	3841	B
level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed	3841	B
and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education	3841	B
uh including uh	3841	B
exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do	3841	B
uh database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can't function	3841	B
you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you	3841	B
unless you have the education and then education- and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself	3841	B
our topic today	3841	A
right and now i'm sort of don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage my wife's a school teacher so	3841	A
no you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too my wife teaches seventh grade	3841	A
and you know	3841	A
there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but uh	3841	A
for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs and course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even even in the seventh grade	3841	A
Plano School System but but to give you an example uh	3841	A
you know one of her kids will come in and he's	3841	A
you could tell he's just bombed out on drugs and uh she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it	3841	A
you're not allowed to send them_1 home you know if you do that then	3841	A
your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and just it's it's a numbers game i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and	3841	A
preventing other kids from learning	3841	A
yes	3841	A
sure	3841	A
sure	3841	A
oh yeah my son had such a tough time in uh	3841	A
the school he went to but there was through it wasn't all the school's fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in Richardson and that that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was	3841	A
but uh had to be done at least it	3841	A
took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something	3841	A
but i'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today	3841	A
yeah i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate	3841	A
you bet	3841	A
you bet	3841	A
well- it's different-	3841	A
sure well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just	3841	A
are always fighting the system i don't know if it's better than any you know we came down to Texas from the uh New York area we were only there for a short time but my wife is from New York and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and	3841	A
i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from and they they i don't know if they learn more but they certainly uh	3841	A
they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities	3841	A
so you have a child	3811	A
two years old in child care right now	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
uh	3811	A
yes our first and he just turned three months	3811	A
so we're just starting into hunting for child care right now both of us are students	3811	A
uh uh University of Southern Mississippi	3811	A
um	3811	A
she's	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
uh probably um	3811	A
actually spring semester a year from now he's gonna have to be in child care for- uh five days a week	3811	A
more than likely uh depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing her internship that semester it'll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing	3811	A
so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four six- anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point right now we're trying to avoid it but we just	3811	A
a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him uh i get out of class at	3811	A
certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class	3811	A
you- know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home so for about_1 twenty minutes- twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
uh that makes a big difference	3811	A
yes	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists	3811	A
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university's uh uh department of um uh well- their Home Economics- Department	3811	A
um they uh they have a subbranch uh American Family Counseling and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus	3811	A
but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list so uh	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
well- it's best	3811	A
yeah a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
yeah	3811	A
um-hum	3811	A
yes	3811	A
it's amazing how much good things like uh Sesame Street will do	3811	A
is uh	3811	A
yeah we have a	3811	B
two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh	3811	B
pretty reasonable price we think	3811	B
how about you do you have any children	3811	B
oh boy	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
are you where are you student	3811	B
no kidding	3811	B
i was a professor in a university here in California for a while	3811	B
yeah uh are you gonna uh put your son in child care in a a year or two	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
uh-huh	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
well that's a good experience i think and uh there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to	3811	B
uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found	3811	B
um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh that's more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier	3811	B
um facility um she goes to a home this is a um	3811	B
a couple uh emigrated from China early in in their lives they've been here probably thirty forty years they've got three daughters	3811	B
um and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them_1 in the afternoon	3811	B
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience i think- if it's good i think it's very good for the child	3811	B
and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year	3811	B
but um we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh	3811	B
just uh	3811	B
choose in the marketplace i don't know what it's like around uh Hattiesburg	3811	B
uh-huh	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
i'll bet they're involved	3811	B
yeah	3811	B
yeah well that's uh i know it's it's a real uh hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities out here at Stanford they have a	3811	B
you know a a a real good facility and there uh is is quite a waiting list to get into that so it's uh	3811	B
you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and i think that it it really is buyer beware	3811	B
well it is the best way to do it interestingly i think that um my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that um	3811	B
private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn because i think what we're gonna go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that	3811	B
uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh	3811	B
pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for	3811	B
uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life	3811	B
it's it's phenomenal it's phenomenal the the programming	3811	B
the human operating system is my area-	3811	B
well uh as a former uh professor in a university and having been through college uh	3840	B
and graduate school myself i guess my own um	3840	B
advice would be to first try to assess the needs of the	3840	B
the kid um some kids do very well in large universities	3840	B
and other kids do very well in junior colleges and other kids do very well in residential college environments um	3840	B
and i think it really depends upon the individual the safest bet for most people who want uh	3840	B
uh a good quality experience is a private college where they're gonna get an opportunity to have more personal contact and uh	3840	B
where they're going to be forced by the circumstances to learn more than might be the case in a big university	3840	B
no i went to a big university i went um i went to Pitt as an undergraduate and i looked at small colleges and frankly um	3840	B
i think i had this sense that it would have been more difficult at small colleges and i think it would- would have been definitely i mean i	3840	B
i graduated Phi Beta Kappa summa cum laude and went on to do a PhD and i think that uh had i gone to a small college i might have learned a lot more but i don't think my grades would have been nearly as good	3840	B
i think you can get away with more in a big uh a big university uh what what kind of experience have you had in this regard	3840	B
uh-huh	3840	B
that's big yeah	3840	B
oh yeah	3840	B
well that's all right go ahead	3840	B
uh-huh	3840	B
no kidding	3840	B
um-hum	3840	B
right	3840	B
yeah	3840	B
what i think is one of the problems with with a kid going to a large university generally and this happens at Stanford at Cal out here	3840	B
i- i think that the the residential college experience is generally the best for most kids some kids are particularly- pardon me	3840	B
well i mean uh let me let me give you an example of a college that would fit that description	3840	B
um i would say that uh some of the best colleges in the country	3840	B
are small residential colleges like Swarthmore College like um Amherst Wesleyan Williams College	3840	B
um those are places that that in academia are generally regarded as the best places to get liberal arts educations	3840	B
on the other hand you can go to a big university and do very well and some big universities i don't know whether Bringham Young is like this but some have a small college feel to them you don't get a lot of foreign TAs you- i mean in other words that the people who teach really know how to teach	3840	B
and i think that's what important for a lot of kids uh in my case	3840	B
i went through uh between sixty eight and seventy two in college and it was just this big uh grade game for me	3840	B
and i learned some things and i just luckily stumbled in the right area	3840	B
um but i was years out of graduate school i had worked in industry before i ever came back and wanted to use my training as a scientist to um	3840	B
you know to get anything done and as matter of fact i'm i'm working on a book and a theory	3840	B
uh which has its foundations ultimately in theoretical physics and i'd never would have imagined myself wanting to do something like that i had such a negative-	3840	B
um Lee what advice do you have for someone choosing a college	3840	A
uh-huh did you go to a private college for your undergraduate	3840	A
uh-huh	3840	A
well um	3840	A
i went to a private university although it was a large private university it was Bringham Young University in Utah and that's uh has about twenty seven thousand students	3840	A
so it's it's pretty big	3840	A
but	3840	A
i enjoyed my experience there one thing i was thinking about this topic is um	3840	A
i would try and get a lot of input from	3840	A
from other students who had gone to the college in the particular program and see how they liked it for example i made well- i had a bad experience in graduate school	3840	A
and i think i would never have gone to the place had i have went and visited the place and talked to some of the students who were currently in the program for example i um started graduate school um	3840	A
in well i don't know if i should give specific names but uh it was	3840	A
um it was just in a physics program back east and um well it happened to be in Pittsburgh it was the University- it was Carnegie Melon University and	3840	A
the teaching assistantship situation just was not very good it turned out that um	3840	A
there were six new teaching assistants from the US who went we all quit after our first year of graduate school um	3840	A
it turned out that the undergraduates had thrown a big fit the several years before that they weren't learning from the foreign TAs and they had six new students from- foreign TAs-	3840	A
TAs also but the foreign TAs could not teach the classes and so there was a huge teaching burden on us the US um	3840	A
TAs and so it's we were really bogged down and	3840	A
you mean community college type or you mean by residential college do you mean	3840	A
oh i see oh	3840	A
oh yeah	3840	A
i i don't have a lot of things that invade my every- everyday privacy probably the the one thing that i feel is a is a bother is uh soliciting over the phone	3882	A
from uh either for donations for different things or	3882	A
in the local area uh we have quite a bit of this i understand there's a a law now where some companies are unable to do this after the first of January but i haven't i really don't know too much about that but	3882	A
i really- other than that i don't really have anything that uh i feel invades my- my privacy how about you	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
well that's- that's good uh i don't think	3882	A
yes i	3882	A
you bet and once you order something it seems like you get on their list and they send everything	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
that's	3882	A
uh-huh yeah	3882	A
uh that that's true and i don't know how you you stop that if you order anything at all	3882	A
and then use your credit card or get anything from any mail order catalogs or anything then everybody starts sending the stuff	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
right and i don't know what can be done about that but uh i'm sure that this is	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
well that's great that's good to hear i'll	3882	A
uh-huh well i have a son and uh	3882	A
hm yes well that that would be great i mean you know	3882	A
yes it is like you say we're paying for it one way or the other	3882	A
and the postage and uh and	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
we don't have a lot of that uh where i live uh very little but i would imagine that where you live in a larger area	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
well	3882	A
it really would be and and then the that really invades it plus uh you- you just trying to settle down to do something and then uh here they come and they had	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
oh	3882	A
oh my goodness-	3882	A
yeah	3882	A
yes oh wow yeah	3882	A
i'm sure we must have um well i'm i'm sure we have a law in uh in Brigham City on that because uh we very- very seldom	3882	A
uh have anyone coming around but once in a while somebody will come in and then uh the word gets out and then nobody in the neighborhood will answer the door but uh	3882	A
we don't have maybe oh two or three times a year so there's there's got to be something uh i'm sure that that	3882	A
prohibits them from doing that	3882	A
but uh	3882	A
all of these are really irritants and things that we really don't need	3882	A
uh-huh	3882	A
yes	3882	A
and uh	3882	A
that's true and then some of the advertisements on television some of the things uh that you might want or records or something i dare sent uh	3882	A
i dare sent order any of that stuff because then	3882	A
i feel that the mail is also it's the telephones and the mails that get me i think the mails all these ads and things that they send and there should be a limit on that also	3882	B
not only financially but it's costing me and us really in advertising we're paying for all that junk that we throw in the	3882	B
that's right and they have a and then you get your list there of privacy you know out of that comes the um and then then being able to use your name	3882	B
and that's invading your privacy to me now that is one of the biggest one another big one	3882	B
taking your name from lists	3882	B
i know it is it's outrageous how you get the piles of it and uh and then even- it even- even gets to the point where they um	3882	B
oh they can mess up your credit bad with it you know as far as your with your um	3882	B
when you get on all these lists and all they can invade that part of it	3882	B
and	3882	B
i know there is a number i think that or uh the post office you can send in a number and i don't have it myself in fact i thought of getting it my sister has it and said we she'd give it to me and she lives in Ohio	3882	B
and uh there is a number that you can send or a place that you can send to the post office and give them your address and tell them you don't want anymore of this and i just haven't done in fact she was just telling me about it recently	3882	B
so i thought i might check with her on it and get that number and	3882	B
and have a lot of that junk mail stopped because_1 i really that	3882	B
it's a big irritant to me but	3882	B
uh-huh we are	3882	B
and door-to-door soliciting can be another	3882	B
don't you	3882	B
yeah it's a it's as much as a phone call you know invading your privacy and we do hear in a lot of it in Richardson there's quite a bit of it	3882	B
yeah i did have to laugh though they had the um	3882	B
they had the invasion of privacy law uh for weekends now here in Richardson they signed me to see uh	3882	B
on Saturdays and Sundays there is no soliciting allowed- allowed	3882	B
and they even stopped the little Brownies and Girl Scouts from selling their cookies and that really got us and we laughed about it because with one of the um editorials on it was	3882	B
it was great the guy went on about how the little Brownie came or Girl Scout came to the door and the police arrested her for selling their cookies and it was kind of a cute	3882	B
pun against that part of it but you know where do you stop it's true	3882	B
really	3882	B
oh really	3882	B
uh-huh	3882	B
oh well that's good	3882	B
uh-huh	3882	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3882	B
now that's true and it is an invasion- and each time it's a breakdown of our system you know each one is a breakdown of our systems	3882	B
of your privacy- your own privacy	3882	B
that can be very irritable	3882	B
do you have kids in the Texas schools	3873	A
you know the way the question is worded it sounds like the person who made up the questions thinks there is something wrong the way they say is there something seriously wrong this- indicates that she thought that there was something wrong to begin with	3873	A
did you like the schooling	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
so they didn't grow up in Irving	3873	A
oh yeah	3873	A
yeah i sure do i have four uh well three of them are in school in the Plano schools and i really like the schools	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
yeah i think you're right	3873	A
yeah that's such such a hard line because parents want to have control over their children	3873	A
you know so they want don't want anyone to discipline them and yet they also want this same person who doesn't have the authority to discipline them to command respect and the two don't go hand in hand	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
not only that but so many parents nowadays work and that's a low priority you know that is just some place that the kids go while they work	3873	A
and so it's not like they have the time to sit and think about those kind of things because	3873	A
you know they have job career and you know and other things on their mind	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
that's right see my husband is the treasurer of the middle school that my daughter goes to and they're just always amazed at the lack of participation of the	3873	A
the parents and the things that they you know the programs that they try to put on and no one comes and they you know finally have kind of decided they're not interested and we i guess we shouldn't be either and that's kind of sad	3873	A
um-hum	3873	A
that's right	3873	A
kind of a job	3873	A
uh-huh	3873	A
yeah yeah that's that's exactly right	3873	A
yeah	3873	A
see i've noticed with my elementary kids also that they want them_1 to grow up so fast	3873	A
you know that they want them_1 to have it's good to teach them_1 responsibility but boy the punishment	3873	A
uh i don't now my children are all grown but they did go through the Texas school system	3873	B
uh yes but it was in a smaller town and uh it was in a town where i knew uh uh an awful lot of the people and kept track of them_1 and i think that made a difference i	3873	B
no they grew up in uh a town in uh north Texas in Sherman do you have children here	3873	B
well i think Plano has a fairly good system because uh well just looking by the uh uh some of the scores coming out	3873	B
uh my children well now we did not uh they did not go to school until uh uh junior high but they were in Sherman Texas	3873	B
and one of my cousins was the principal but some of the problems i see now is i think uh	3873	B
some uh as i said my children have been out for quite a while but a lot of my friends have children and i can see a difference from between when my sons went through and what their children are doing and it seems to me that uh	3873	B
they're they're spending less and less uh	3873	B
uh well my children had to have a lot more respect for their teachers than i think the- the- the students now days do	3873	B
and i think there is the uh	3873	B
that respect has has carried over and uh um they're they're not being taught respect	3873	B
uh	3873	B
unless and i don't know what you can do about it other than you know that is one of the the examples one of the examples i see	3873	B
no i think also too you're you're right in the fact i think parents there is a lack of participation among parents it's uh too often the school is used as a dumping ground	3873	B
yeah uh but you're right i hadn't thought about that but	3873	B
but uh well also you know	3873	B
they they don't go	3873	B
to the open houses to the the parent teacher you know	3873	B
there's just a very small minority of of uh parents that do that	3873	B
that is i think uh	3873	B
one of the things that i see course this is uh	3873	B
uh just- again an outsider view is too often that the school system is set up now uh based on the way it was for the last two hundred years on an an agrarian society uh culture	3873	B
and the life styles now like you said there are too many two parent uh working parents and uh a lot of them_1 work uh there is not your nine to five shifts there's a lot of shifts	3873	B
and it's a shame they cannot set up school systems that uh are not based on a Monday through Friday uh kind of you know a job	3873	B
or uh i wouldn't mind seeing evening you know uh utilizing- utilizing the schools uh opening up an evening uh	3873	B
you know a morning school and an evening school	3873	B
that way the the buildings would but now i am looking at other areas where they're having problems with over crowding and uh	3873	B
course you you'd have to have more teachers for that also but you could utilize the buildings just as well and it would be based on the life styles of their families	3873	B
so that's a you know that's just a possibility	3873	B
and again i think also a lot of times they they	3873	B
there needs to be more emphasis on some of your basic education	3873	B
uh reading skills especially	3873	B
oh yeah that's	3873	B
why don't you start because_1 i'm sure you've seen more movies than i have	3858	A
no have you	3858	A
no and i -like i heard some bad reviews on that	3858	A
yeah yeah have you seen any lately what about videos	3858	A
is it a new one with him	3858	A
it wasn't Hudson Hawk was it	3858	A
oh i haven't see that one	3858	A
oh even i mean Keenan Ivory yeah i guess so Ivory is his last name	3858	A
uh-huh	3858	A
uh-huh	3858	A
well i had a little more time to think while they were trying to find somebody and you know i haven't seen i haven't seen um any current releases my husband and i just don't get out to the movies that much	3858	A
um no but we we're lazy we like to rent and watch them_1 and be able to rewind them and say what he say	3858	A
we saw well we saw Flatliners i like that a lot	3858	A
yeah and um let's see Awakenings did you see that	3858	A
oh it was great it was real good it was kind of and it's a true story or so they say yeah about these people that that uh like	3858	A
near comatose i guess you'd say and they uh with medication they're able to wake them_1 up after- after like twenty thirty years and i mean it's not a real action packed movie but it was pretty neat	3858	A
ooh and did you like that one you did okay and	3858	A
you know i've been wanting to i every time i go to the movie store to rent that it's all rented	3858	A
yeah i mean i've been at least three or four times just to get that movie and every time i go i guess i must be going at the wrong times	3858	A
i did see Beauty and the Beast it's beautiful	3858	A
yeah just go to a matinee there's so many kids there nobody will notice- notice that you're not you know with a kid i said there's there's so many people you won't notice you're not they won't notice you're not with anybody	3858	A
yes	3858	A
hm yeah i saw that one too did you like that one	3858	A
did you that was pretty long one	3858	A
how many times did you see Dances with Wolves	3858	A
you did	3858	A
uh i did too it was so sweet	3858	A
yeah i wanna see that one too my husband kind of went hm	3858	A
so he wasn't real excited about going to see that one have may have to go with my mom	3858	A
oh really yeah i'll probably wait for that one to came up on video it has to be real good for me to spend the money	3858	A
which one	3858	A
oh i haven't seen that one either	3858	A
you cried in Terminator 2	3858	A
okay let's see have- uh did you say you'd seen Flatliners yeah okay what about let's see Edward Scissorhands	3858	A
i just loved that movie that was so sweet	3858	A
oh no i haven't either my in in fact we're supposed to get out to movies tonight but i don't know what we're gonna go see	3858	A
yeah well we might be going to a late one yeah	3858	A
yeah see we've got HBO and you they have to be pretty old to get on there	3858	A
well i think so i think they have a lot of the same ones run over and over again	3858	A
yeah that's what i hate is they overdo it when you know when they get a major release	3858	A
yeah is it good	3858	A
is it	3858	A
yeah well my dad is if you can believe that but i'm not a real Tom Cruise fan	3858	A
nah he's okay but i don't think i don't see uh what i guess all the young girls see in him	3858	A
i don't know um let's see have you seen John F Kennedy	3858	B
no i wanted to go see that one i was hoping my roommate went and saw it and she liked it what about um Hand That Rocks the Cradle	3858	B
it's supposed to be kind of scary well let's	3858	B
no well i mean	3858	B
um let's see	3858	B
well actually i have seen one i'm trying to think of the name of it um	3858	B
it's got Bruce Willis in it and um	3858	B
yeah but i can't think of who's in it but it was real good	3858	B
no huh-uh that was horrible	3858	B
um it's the guy that's- from In Living Color	3858	B
i yeah well- you you know who i'm talking about i'm trying to	3858	B
well i can't think of it but that was it was really i thought i liked it because_1 it was funny and they had so many it was i mean it was really action packed and it was bloody but they had a lot of um	3858	B
like one liners and stuff but i cannot think of the name i'm so bad with names of movies	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
do you have children	3858	B
oh	3858	B
i hear you well Leslie there's um a ton	3858	B
now what was that like	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
um-hum	3858	B
i remember the name of it's called The Last Boy Scout it was with Bruce Willis and i can't think of the other name the guy's name but yeah it was good	3858	B
i'm trying to think well- uh what about City Slickers since you watch um	3858	B
that's the same with same with me	3858	B
okay well um let's see	3858	B
well i want to go see that one but i'll probably wait for it- till it comes out on video because_1 i don't think i can get any my date to take me	3858	B
well- that's why i'm	3858	B
doing it well-	3858	B
yeah that's true well um what about did you see Dances with Wolves	3858	B
i saw that two or three times and then what's the other one Kevin Costner was in	3858	B
Robin Hood	3858	B
okay yeah i've i've probably seen it about three times um-hum	3858	B
yeah but i like Kevin Costner	3858	B
i only watched that once	3858	B
yeah and i cried	3858	B
uh i could probably tell you more that i wanna see than i have seen what about um Fried Green Tomatoes	3858	B
yeah well	3858	B
well a friend of mine went to see is it what's the name of it Father of the Bride with Steve Martin and she said that was real cute um-hum	3858	B
what about the one with um Arnold Schwarzenegger whatever	3858	B
Terminator 2	3858	B
well that's good i cried at that one too	3858	B
yeah at the at the end i won't tell you but i'll miss that	3858	B
yeah	3858	B
that i saw for the first time uh uh probably about two weeks ago	3858	B
um-hum that's cute then there're some what are some other ones i wonder	3858	B
i haven't really seen that many new ones because-	3858	B
now it's too late now	3858	B
no well- um trying to think what else i've seen	3858	B
that's even- i guess if i see them_1 it's because they come on HBO or whatever	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
well see now Edward Scissorhands been on there like every week now	3858	B
i'm trying	3858	B
and then well what about the one with Tom Cruise in it that's an old one Days of Thunder	3858	B
really	3858	B
it- it- it's okay probably have to be a Tom Cruise fan	3858	B
oh really	3858	B
well it was yes what do you think about the uh former Soviet Union	3864	B
yeah	3864	B
it seems that way sometimes you wonder if um an economic threat isn't gonna drive people to do things that would be more drastic than if uh they were a little bit more peaceful you know	3864	B
but i think it would probably not be a a threat to the United States if that was the case but probably to Europe other other areas of Europe there	3864	B
well that's what it seemed like even before they uh dissolved the Union was that it was becoming less and less of a of a threat to the United States uh more and more of an attempted	3864	B
uh you know relating on more or less normal bases	3864	B
are you involved in	3864	B
oh that's right	3864	B
that's for sure are you involved in any kind of uh political analysis or anything	3864	B
no not really we're involved in some of our company work in the Soviet Union in different places but not in	3864	B
uh any area of uh endeavor that would be of any interest to you know militarily or anything like that	3864	B
uh linguistics primarily	3864	B
and so it's interesting to see uh how things are going there and and their the people that are there are facing the same kind of	3864	B
uh economic deprivation that uh you know the Russian citizens are but not- it doesn't relate to much to the military uh situation	3864	B
yes	3864	B
yeah i read an interesting- an article in a recent uh	3864	B
Wall Street Journal uh interview with a family there and	3864	B
you know we think of uh how great it is to go to a you know free market uh sort of thing and and they're saying- facing uh something that most people are not even aware you know familiar with they wouldn't- they don't know how to deal with it and uh how do you	3864	B
how do you compete when you you're whole you know life has been built on uh working for the state and everything you know things like that	3864	B
yeah right	3864	B
you face the same uh uh bureaucratic uh headaches whether you work or don't work so- and so now they've you know so really it must be uh really traumatic time for the people as well as the uh	3864	B
lack of supplies or anything like that adjusting to the new way of thinking about things	3864	B
um-hum	3864	B
yeah right	3864	B
taught to understand that's right yeah	3864	B
well perhaps the uh if we give aid of some sort you know maybe it'll turn them_1 around if it's done done correctly you know economically-	3864	B
sure	3864	B
you mean in in our country or in	3864	B
sure	3864	B
yeah you can't that's right and well i hope you know just hope we don't wait too long and and uh you know	3864	B
that's that's a timely kind of a question isn't it	3864	A
i really don't think that i would consider them a threat any longer and i suppose that's primarily because	3864	A
their economy really won't allow them to uh expend a lot of	3864	A
resources on on war um if that were their primary concern	3864	A
and it'll be a while before they're an economic threat for sure	3864	A
um-hum um-hum	3864	A
do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they would be a threat uh that given their political changes they would still be a threat or	3864	A
um-hum um-hum	3864	A
right	3864	A
there there've been such drastic changes in their political orientation that it's	3864	A
hard to predict what it will look like in fifty years but certainly so far what we've seen is a turn around from where things were fifty years ago	3864	A
no no and yourself	3864	A
really	3864	A
uh-huh personal interests or business	3864	A
uh-huh	3864	A
yes	3864	A
yes yeah their problems are definitely at this point economic it it seems that the whole infrastructure is focused on you know organizational um	3864	A
skimming off the top you know especially the government but um it's gonna be awhile before the people adopt the philosophy that	3864	A
if you work harder you can also benefit personally and that	3864	A
um-hum	3864	A
um-hum	3864	A
and and almost um the philosophy has been put in as little as you can because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so why spend the extra energy	3864	A
uh-huh	3864	A
yeah	3864	A
i wonder too if their thinking hasn't been so influenced over the years that the Western way is bad that	3864	A
it would it's hard for them to look at some of the Western market place strategies as being good because they've been	3864	A
propagandized the other direction for so long	3864	A
i think that they're one economy that i feel that that's worth the investment you know there are some	3864	A
um places in the world where i'm not sure that the money that the United States is putting in is really getting the kind of return that that's gonna benefit both parties but	3864	A
um it seems that there's such an effort to make it work there that what they really do need is is the loans and the	3864	A
uh strategic assistance from other countries i'll i'll be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesn't seem as though that's forth coming right now um	3864	A
that	3864	A
yeah i think well i was watching something the other day a news program that that indicated um	3864	A
the concern on Bush's part is that if he puts	3864	A
great interest in that area now he's gonna be accused of not spending enough time on the domestic issues you know certainly foreign issues are his strength so it's a catch twenty two	3864	A
you say you a Steeler fan	3859	A
so did i no kidding	3859	A
yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterday's Super Bowl	3859	A
he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career	3859	A
well that's what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think that's the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people	3859	A
um	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
no	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
how about_1 Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
well i had- you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um they've certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadn't lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game	3859	A
but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end	3859	A
well Montana made a difference but as the analysts- analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday	3859	A
Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i- i frankly am surprised that	3859	A
um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays	3859	A
yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i mean- you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself	3859	A
because_1 they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal	3859	A
and uh	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
it it's it's it's nine years ago	3859	A
yeah it's been- been a while	3859	A
well it is it is a little disappointing and there's some it it's very interesting to see you know what's what's behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the the draft picks would uh	3859	A
you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference	3859	A
uh i don't understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didn't do anything uh Cincinnati they didn't do anything now uh Buffalo	3859	A
yeah	3859	A
well you know i think that's sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad	3859	A
i mean i just it's it's it's shameful and and i think that that once Pandora's out of the box you know	3859	A
so i don't know i- i- i- i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think it's it's reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call what-	3859	A
well there yeah there- there is that problem and- and- but uh i guess that that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid	3859	A
all right uh yeah not as much as i used to be i- i grew up in Pittsburgh and	3859	B
did you yeah i left there i went to school out that way that about forty miles east of Pittsburgh and then uh	3859	B
i left in the mid sixties and right after i left well a few years later they started having some good teams	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah he's looking good he's sixty i think and he just you know	3859	B
yeah for considering	3859	B
yeah they just uh i don't know what happened they just weren't getting any draft picks and weren't i guess they just weren't picking the right guy weren't right people	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
right	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
yeah they uh he was loyal to a lot of those guys that	3859	B
helped uh helped him win those Super Bowls in the seventies and uh stuck with him too long and then i think the	3859	B
the draft uh picks did fall on hard times and they just never were able to get back to where they were	3859	B
but uh uh we've lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years and i've never become a Cowboys fan in fact i don't i just don't like them_1 at all but	3859	B
i	3859	B
oh i like them better than the Cowboys i don't i just uh	3859	B
other than the Steelers i don't have a real a real favorite uh like the Eagles i like the Redskins but uh usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing for the most part you're a Forty Niner fan	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
hum	3859	B
yeah yeah they had	3859	B
yeah they weren't the same without Montana	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
oh was he calling the plays i didn't even	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah he had a	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
right yeah well couple of those passes a couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped some important uh passes too they it would have made might have made a little bit of a difference not much but uh	3859	B
i don't i- i just looked in the paper this this evening and trying to figure out when the last time the AFC won a game guess it was eighty four Raiders	3859	B
Raiders beat uh the Redskins i think as a matter of fact but boy it's	3859	B
i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because_1 i'm getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh	3859	B
right	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
yeah well	3859	B
Buffalo twice- well they did get close last year they could have won last Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants	3859	B
but uh just seems like there's a big gap in talent between the or maybe in coaching between the AFC and the NFC because_1 it's like i said it's been nine years or eight years since they uh since AFCs won a game	3859	B
but uh i guess they're gonna somebody was saying uh somebody- i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going	3859	B
um-hum yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
yeah	3859	B
well	3859	B
um yeah i just don't like it it it delays the game it delays uh i don't know it it just kind of interrupts- interrupts the flow of things and uh i	3859	B
um-hum	3859	B
-okay	3883	A
so how'd you just figure	3883	A
wow	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
oh huh uh	3883	A
well um	3883	A
i'm going to talk about when i was working as a teacher and when i was um what i'm what i'm doing now um when i was a teacher um in Utah	3883	A
i would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that and	3883	A
even when it um rained and snowed i just braved it and i wore heels anyways because_1 and	3883	A
oh oh yeah well i need all the height i can get	3883	A
oh yeah	3883	A
uh-huh yeah me too um if it was really- it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots but then i would change um into heels as soon as i got to my desk so um	3883	A
oh	3883	A
oh	3883	A
sure uh-huh	3883	A
uh-huh	3883	A
yeah	3883	A
oh huh	3883	A
oh well um	3883	A
yeah um	3883	A
the first two years i was in a room where they didn't heat it	3883	A
so i did	3883	A
yeah and the third year we um got heating so	3883	A
it was nice	3883	A
right uh-huh	3883	A
oh that's nice	3883	A
uh-huh oh nice well	3883	A
uh no we we moved to Iowa and um i'm working at a day care right now	3883	A
and so the way i dress is really different because i'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months	3883	A
yeah i wear uh tennis shoes and jeans and things that you know are sort of um not	3883	A
yeah if it doesn't matter if i have to wash it a hundred times or something	3883	A
yeah but i never wore jeans because_1 um i thought that was too casual	3883	A
for	3883	A
yeah really	3883	A
yeah that's how i feel too	3883	A
um oh it there's some good things about it that i've seen a lot of things i'm not used to yet um	3883	A
um we lived in Utah before and and i grew up in California	3883	A
well you know it depends upon our weather here you know today was a beautiful day it was like uh uh summer day it was seventy degrees so	3883	B
so i dressed in um uh a light weight skirt it's a uh ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan	3883	B
over it because i had some appointments at the office today some interviews and so i had to dress up anyway and then i wore heels you know	3883	B
but when it rains a lot which it has been doing here a lot lately uh very often you know wear uh pants and boots	3883	B
you know so how do you dress	3883	B
okay	3883	B
um-hum	3883	B
yeah i can- i can see i i've been a teacher so has my daughter and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring	3883	B
that's right	3883	B
that's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids right	3883	B
yeah i do too so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades uh older grades i had to wear heels	3883	B
um-hum	3883	B
well of course we wear uh an unlined boot you know it it has a heel on it that's the kind of boots that i wear to work	3883	B
and we wear them_1 you know they're a leather boot that you wear as i said they have a regular heel on them high heel	3883	B
and they wear them_1 we wear them a lot with shirts and things	3883	B
in Texas that you wear these boots they're not a cowboy boot but they're just a real pretty boot but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain	3883	B
as i have a private high school that i run here and so when i'm interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels	3883	B
you know and look like i'm a business person you know	3883	B
because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often you know	3883	B
of course you probably wear coats a lot	3883	B
oh my goodness so then you had to	3883	B
yes then things improved right	3883	B
but of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot	3883	B
you know you know and uh that's very seldom we it depends upon our winter we have a few days you might wear a coat winter coat	3883	B
you know but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much we often laugh about even when it turns chilly we're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that	3883	B
it's really different let's put it that way are you not teaching anymore	3883	B
i see	3883	B
oh so you don't wear heels anymore i'll bet	3883	B
yeah uh-huh	3883	B
more practical	3883	B
when- when you were teaching did you ever have uh uh a blue jean day or anything like that	3883	B
yeah yeah well i know that in some of the schools they have uh	3883	B
country western day or something like that when you know or tacky day and i always thought it was kind of out of	3883	B
got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too	3883	B
it's all right for the students they look tacky a lot but i didn't think teachers should you know	3883	B
yeah uh do you like uh uh Iowa	3883	B
where did you live before	3883	B
oh well that's quite a change from California to Utah	3883	B
well i guess we're uh	3887	B
forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that	3887	B
the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels- fuels are being experimented with ethanol and	3887	B
other types of fuels	3887	B
i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i	3887	B
i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from what comes over the border from us	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um	3887	B
do away with the CFCs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem	3887	B
again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was	3887	B
uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially	3887	B
well it is scary and i think it will uh	3887	B
continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively	3887	B
we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment	3887	B
i- i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that in Los Angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh	3887	B
barbecues gasoline lawn mowers	3887	B
um and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles and it's gotten bad in Denver and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky	3887	B
and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
well that makes a lot of sense i mean i- i hadn't thought about it that way but it it	3887	B
yeah	3887	B
no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth	3887	B
which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a uh a whole	3887	B
set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a	3887	B
big structural change in the economy	3887	B
uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in- in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars	3887	B
and uh i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but	3887	B
i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure	3887	B
how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy	3887	B
is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell	3887	B
uh	3887	A
yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from	3887	A
or sources	3887	A
that's what i would think	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area	3887	A
uh any any industry that burns you know	3887	A
and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real	3887	A
into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick	3887	A
but i don't know if that affects outside	3887	A
you know i- i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it yeah	3887	A
yeah that's it it's kind of scary	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces	3887	A
i think it will	3887	A
uh-huh	3887	A
right	3887	A
right	3887	A
yeah in this area too since you know in Texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh	3887	A
it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas	3887	A
and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in	3887	A
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets	3887	A
you don't have to have mountains there stopping it	3887	A
and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings and uh	3887	A
so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here	3887	A
right	3887	A
um-hum	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
yeah	3887	A
yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but	3887	A
uh well i guess we're not as bad as a lot of places but uh we're out here on the Great Plains so there's some place for it to go	3888	B
yeah	3888	B
yeah i've heard that	3888	B
um-hum	3888	B
yeah i think that's probably the problem with any of the coastal cities i think that's what New York has such a problem with	3888	B
you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast	3888	B
i don't think it's as bad yeah	3888	B
i know there's some because in my visits to New York i noticed that my i wear i'm a contact lens wearer and i noticed that i have to uh take out my contacts	3888	B
yeah i can't wear them_1 as many hours during the day as i can other places but you know i mean that's not just New York i mean that's also Europe you know Rome is the worst city i've ever been at	3888	B
course now i hear that uh you now like Mexico City is real bad for that	3888	B
and also places in Brazil like Sao Paulo you know	3888	B
yeah	3888	B
well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever	3888	B
so whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we have they just like fire away you know	3888	B
they control nothing i mean it's like it's like you know the situation- it you know Brazil even though there's there's in Brazil uh it- it's my understanding because i have some friends there that are Brazilian	3888	B
uh there's an upper-class and a lower-class and no middle-class	3888	B
and so you know the lower class is working uh in the factories which pollute the air and the upper classes make the money off of the factories	3888	B
and so pollution is a big problem for all of the you know underdeveloped countries because_1 they're not going to they're not going to start instituting regulations that are going to impede their whatever industry they happen to have	3888	B
which you know that's kind of going to be the end result you know Bush- i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory	3888	B
uh things right now that are going to impede business the first effect that it has had is the EPA had some new regs up	3888	B
for um congressional approval that had to do with making industries uh itemize uh different types of things that they were you know	3888	B
putting into the air you know part of the clean air act you know which is to help enforce the clean air act and so that of course you know the moratorium on new regulations has you know hamstrung that	3888	B
absolutely not	3888	B
not any profit driven industry because you know they're just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything that's going to take away from profits i mean we're we're living in the greed generation here i mean there is no there is	3888	B
sure i mean you know	3888	B
i mean i've heard- i've heard that before and i'm now beginning to believe it because	3888	B
you know what i mean i have some limited involvement in some in some what you would call i guess environmental type entities i'm an attorney and i write letters for a number of environmental um	3888	B
uh purposes and you know it it is amazing to me that people can sit here and look at the situation that we have globally and say you know what the hell	3888	B
because uh you know it's it's really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry you know are going away	3888	B
well how polluted do you think we are down here	3888	A
i think so	3888	A
uh-huh	3888	A
yeah i guess so and it's still a little bit flat around here and there's no specific mountains to hem it in	3888	A
uh we used to live in California and although we were not in the smoggy area of Los Angeles we used to visit down there and honestly you could	3888	A
you could you could see the smog hanging over the city it's just about uh	3888	A
yes we can and a friend of mine lives out in San Bernardino	3888	A
and uh uh just beyond San Bernardino	3888	A
is the desert and separating San Bernardino from the desert are some mountain ranges and when the smog gets very very bad in Los Angeles it moves out there and then is bounded	3888	A
it's a very very strange thing	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
yeah although you know	3888	A
um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
yeah	3888	A
i- i do think that's what's one of the real problems although i grew up in New York and i never noticed this kind of pollution as i- i saw in uh you know southern California	3888	A
and then um-hum	3888	A
yes um-hum	3888	A
oh	3888	A
clean them	3888	A
uh oh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
uh	3888	A
oh uh-huh	3888	A
oh i see well i've never been down there	3888	A
is that right well what are they doing down there that causes such a thing what kind of industries do they have	3888	A
i see	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
i see um	3888	A
oh i see um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um-hum um	3888	A
oh i see uh-huh um	3888	A
um	3888	A
profits i guess	3888	A
um-hum yeah uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
right	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
that's right uh-huh i- i know that	3888	A
a lot of the European countries and Mexico and the South American countries simply do not have the governmental regulations and i think that unless the government is uh	3888	A
on top of this or at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going to be done by private industry until they you know get that push it really wasn't done in our country	3888	A
you know um um-hum yeah uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
uh-huh the greed generation oh what a terrible thing to say uh-huh	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
oh i see	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
oh i know um um-hum	3888	A
um-hum	3888	A
um-hum um-hum	3888	A
um	3888	A
oh	3888	A
no i don't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer	3801	B
uh	3801	B
uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something's happens on Mockingbird	3801	B
and then heard yells and screams and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house	3801	B
and they had stopped a uh a stolen car	3801	B
and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back	3801	B
by- on my house	3801	B
so i'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it	3801	B
it was	3801	B
i uh i kept hearing noises and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage so i got a gun- my gun	3801	B
and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure	3801	B
is Plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area	3801	B
that's too bad	3801	B
um-hum um-hum	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
well i was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen Plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
yeah	3801	B
well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway	3801	B
uh well it's further west of me	3801	B
i live over near White Rock Lake	3801	B
but uh uh it was really frightening to think that uh it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth uh i never thought about someone robbing those	3801	B
but apparently they do	3801	B
yeah it just doesn't seem possible does it	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
no	3801	B
yeah	3801	B
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see	3801	B
it it is convenient isn't it i didn't know what i was doing	3801	B
that kind of	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
well yes and i work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System and uh uh uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are	3801	B
uh no this is over near Lincoln High School	3801	B
uh just not far off South Central Expressway	3801	B
it is a pretty rough area we're over by Fair Park	3801	B
and uh	3801	B
you know you watch the people there are marvelous BMW's and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns	3801	B
and the kids see that and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if	3801	B
um-hum	3801	B
it surely is	3801	B
well i'm careful	3801	B
yeah it's uh a little scary sometimes and uh i manage the	3801	B
well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone you're in	3801	A
i'm afraid you're right	3801	A
oh my	3801	A
oh boy	3801	A
by your house	3801	A
oh my goodness ah aye aye	3801	A
oh my that's that's got to be a frightening way to spend- spend an evening	3801	A
oh boy	3801	A
unfortunately yes yes	3801	A
i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get	3801	A
the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there and i think uh	3801	A
you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek but uh we've been we've lived here sixteen years and	3801	A
now you you know you -can tell the change for sure	3801	A
yes	3801	A
well with all the uh	3801	A
Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the	3801	A
uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by you know and	3801	A
that's that couldn't be too far from you neither uh	3801	A
okay_1	3801	A
oh yes okay	3801	A
i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but	3801	A
it's kind of	3801	A
kind of stupid isn't it	3801	A
but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right	3801	A
i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too	3801	A
right	3801	A
right right just like the old alcohol idea and	3801	A
i think people uh	3801	A
i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are	3801	A
too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money	3801	A
oh boy where do you work	3801	A
uh yes i think i do that uh	3801	A
is that Amelia Earhart -Earhart School there	3801	A
okay	3801	A
that's a pretty rough area there isn't it	3801	A
um my goodness	3801	A
huh	3801	A
definitely that area that that's big time big time there sure is	3801	A
i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself in that area	3801	A
gee that's the worst neighborhood in the whole city- area	3801	A
okay	3847	B
uh no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's	3847	B
really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas i used to live in Arizona and it was very confusing- very frustrating because_1 i didn't have the	3847	B
watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough water automatically- you know naturally as well as have the automatic sprinklers and so it's a lot more rewarding	3847	B
so	3847	B
oh that's right	3847	B
um-hum is is that enough during the hotter times of the year	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah i- i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and-	3847	B
and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they'd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would	3847	B
come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting	3847	B
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so	3847	B
um i'm gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that	3847	B
you know feels	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah those are enjoyable	3847	B
oh did you	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
um those are nice	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
yeah yeah i haven't done much in in bulbs in fact i received as a Christmas present a a	3847	B
a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and	3847	B
it's just nice and green right now	3847	B
uh no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a paper- white paper flower or something	3847	B
and uh so i don't know	3847	B
no not really and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we had some	3847	B
some play yard last over but it's	3847	B
it's um you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's that's about the size of most of them_1	3847	B
and	3847	B
yeah	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
uh yeah	3847	B
yeah	3847	B
um-hum	3847	B
oh do you	3847	B
oh	3847	B
uh-huh	3847	B
yeah yeah	3847	B
that's one part of gardening i haven't tried yet and i don't think this yard is a very	3847	B
-okay i pushed it	3847	A
so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it	3847	A
uh-huh	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
yeah right	3847	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3847	A
well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything but um our water supply right now is bad we need rain badly	3847	A
uh we can water here and Patterson i can water on Tuesdays Thursdays	3847	A
Saturday and Sunday four days a week	3847	A
so	3847	A
it was this last summer yeah	3847	A
uh now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know	3847	A
but um yeah we do our lawn- our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i	3847	A
do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers	3847	A
and uh	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
oh	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
yeah	3847	A
yeah we have quite a few roses i just uh we in fact we just pruned them_1 uh way down and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them_1 so i just bought that yesterday and uh probably go outside today and plant that	3847	A
but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long	3847	A
i even had uh roses on my table for Christmas dinner	3847	A
which was really pretty you know but um other than the roses i don't have too many flowers i plant gladiolas	3847	A
and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they they bend over so fast	3847	A
you know	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
hum	3847	A
um-hum well is it that one of those Amaryllis	3847	A
no huh	3847	A
oh okay	3847	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3847	A
do you have a big yard	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
um-hum	3847	A
yeah right right	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
um	3847	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum well that makes it nice	3847	A
well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool but we don't have one	3847	A
you know but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have	3847	A
so we do have a garden you know	3847	A
it's just a small one you know but we had a lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini	3847	A
uh it's amazing- it's amazing what you can get out of a little	3847	A
you know it's probably about twenty by	3847	A
i don't know	3847	A
twenty by six something like that and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there	3847	A
but it was nice a few cucumbers	3847	A
um-hum um-hum	3847	A
why don't you tell me about your choir	3810	A
um-hum	3810	A
great	3810	A
um i play the piano	3810	A
and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano	3810	A
he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby	3810	A
uh my husband and my other son who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at Music Man	3810	A
yeah and it was lots of fun	3810	A
um	3810	A
basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions it was the Plano Repertory Theatre	3810	A
and so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band	3810	A
so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school and my daughter takes piano lessons too	3810	A
but uh we just really like music it's a i- i especially like it as an outlet when the TV goes off we get the TV off and and just have some nice quiet music	3810	A
um-hum	3810	A
um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki	3810	A
which is an auditory type learning experience you listen to the music and then learn to play it by learning- by hearing the intervals and things like that	3810	A
i teach uh	3810	A
like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano	3810	A
but he can't learn like that he's a delayed child he's only about	3810	A
i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things	3810	A
and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it	3810	A
uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do something- do something you know educationally	3810	A
so that was really fun my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though	3810	A
so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas	3810	A
um	3810	A
oh i think that's great	3810	A
that's really hard i think because especially if you start them_1 and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something and they go i don't want to do this anymore and you're like	3810	A
God- i really want you to do it you know so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when but	3810	A
i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it	3810	A
uh-huh	3810	A
that's like me	3810	A
well it can get expensive that's for sure	3810	A
i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out	3810	A
yeah so it's been good for our family	3810	A
i don't have any Suzuki students um	3810	A
something happening to me at Christmas time that that verified to me that i will always-	3810	A
oh okay well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing	3810	B
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh Plano Community Orchestra	3810	B
uh just you know different backgrounds it's been really kind of interesting	3810	B
so um	3810	B
oh yeah	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh they did	3810	B
how did	3810	B
how did they get involved in that	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh how fun	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah that's nice you say have your four year old taking lessons already	3810	B
and uh who do you have her or him take it from	3810	B
uh-huh	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
well because_1 my	3810	B
pardon me	3810	B
um-hum um-hum	3810	B
well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of	3810	B
just turning five because_1 she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is	3810	B
is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally she just	3810	B
so i wasn't sure when to start her i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
yeah yeah	3810	B
um-hum um-hum	3810	B
yeah i think she'd like to i just don't know if it's really	3810	B
knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so	3810	B
um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but	3810	B
um so yeah uh so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
yeah	3810	B
um-hum	3810	B
oh that's good	3810	B
well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings from kids who come from a Suzuki method have you had any former Suzuki students	3810	B
i was wondering how they-	3810	B
uh creates some conversation anyway	3824	B
oh no i i think uh i think they're honest i i you know there are some exceptions i think for the majority of them are honest and uh i just think in uh especially in the federal government the thing has just become bigger than	3824	B
both of us all of us and it's just too big to handle and uh i think they look uh	3824	B
they look a lot- fairly incompetent at times and and i just think it's	3824	B
i think they mean well they have good intentions and i as you know as far as the topic goes we as far as i'm concerned they're basically honest people but uh	3824	B
oh	3824	B
oh i don't know what that go ahead go	3824	B
let me get this other thing here hold on a second	3824	B
hello	3824	B
okay i don't know what that was	3824	B
uh no i just think the	3824	B
the uh federal government especially is just so huge i mean problems are so big and uh it's so	3824	B
internationalized that uh i don't know it just i don't know what the solution is but uh i don't think they're in it for their own personal gain uh	3824	B
right	3824	B
well	3824	B
considering that they have to live up there i mean the living conditions up there i mean not the conditions but the private- cost of living is atrocious and uh	3824	B
uh i don't think a lot of them are making uh netting a whole lot of money once they leave up there	3824	B
but uh	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
right and they're just one of uh five hundred and thirty five and you're just talking about the Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
well i think anytime you've got a a Republican administration and a uh oh a so-so senate as far as uh the split between the Democrats and the Republicans and then the democratic uh House uh whoever's in power	3824	B
is going to have their hands full and uh	3824	B
no but uh it's too bad uh but i think it's like a lot of things whether it's a company or an organization of some kind or the goverment- federal government it's uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh	3824	B
you don't have the proper controls in place well then it's going to get out of hand and people are going to look silly kind of foolish foolish and silly when they're uh trying to operate that thing	3824	B
right	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
i know our state government gets a lot of heck as well down here and uh i don't know about of course about states- i don't pay a whole lot of attention to the state government uh we've got a	3824	B
a female governor and she ran against a real clown here a year or so ago and both of them neither- there just wasn't a whole lot to pick from	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
right	3824	B
uh Richards uh Ann Richards is the governor she won then Clayton Williams was the guy that ran against her and he was a west Texas uh rancher and so forth	3824	B
but uh they were both a	3824	B
couple of clowns	3824	B
well they	3824	B
they had a good time it was serious business but i think they enjoyed themselves and a lot of people down here just	3824	B
oh	3824	B
not really she i think uh they she's been in office just about a year now and uh	3824	B
as far as her public uh public opinion surveys i think they give her about a fifty fifty rating she she hasn't uh destroyed the place but the economy down here is in pretty bad shape and she can't do much about that	3824	B
but uh she's she's done okay that who's to say how he would have done he he's a business man he's been successful i i	3824	B
if i had voted i would have voted for him but she's done all right	3824	B
um	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
yeah	3824	B
um	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
she a Republican	3824	B
oh yeah	3824	B
well you	3824	B
um	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
is that right	3824	B
uh-huh	3824	B
well she's going to have to do	3824	B
yeah yeah so what do you think do you think they're honest or they in for it themselves	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain they're probably	3824	A
they what was that your other line or	3824	A
yeah but they'd probably you know they'd stay in for ten or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a consultant for some of these private industries that	3824	A
okay	3824	A
sure thing	3824	A
it's still me	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah there's actually you know you think you know they get paid what a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand that's really not all that much compared to	3824	A
what	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
no	3824	A
oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty idealist approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is and	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
exactly	3824	A
well you look at even the President you know he's got to fight against all you know the other five hundred thirty five to get anything through anyway so	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah it doesn't	3824	A
not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
exactly	3824	A
yeah and like you say it's	3824	A
you know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing and the do- you know even mouth sometimes are doing- going the opposite direction so	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah well there was that was a lot of that was public- quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that Richards wasn't that her name	3824	A
gal that won	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
so are they doing any good is she doing any good or	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
yeah	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
uh-huh	3824	A
yeah did we just uh we got our first woman mayor up here in Salt Lake uh just this past election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but she's a business woman and that's what she was really pushing was	3824	A
business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because	3824	A
you know she's kind of a self-made i don't know if she's a millionaire but she you know got her own businesses and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so	3824	A
uh no she's Democrat	3824	A
which uh	3824	A
actually Salt Lake and the county around Salt Lake is quite a bit Democrat so it's not really surprising we've had a a a Democratic mayor for quite a few years	3824	A
uh the state as a whole is probably more definitely more Republican but	3824	A
yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's	3824	A
she's already stepped on a few toes i think she's making the changes but	3824	A
well	3821	A
credit cards	3821	A
i'll tell you what i i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because_1	3821	A
i uh tore mine up	3821	A
yeah uh i got in some problems with uh	3821	A
financial problems because of credit cards so i	3821	A
uh basically just got rid of all of them i i have a a couple i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and	3821	A
you know uh one that i use just for	3821	A
emergencies but	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
i know it	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
oh is that right that's a that's a good policy	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
yeah uh sometimes i wish i had them but in most cases i'm glad i don't because_1 i you know unfortunately i i-	3821	A
i don't have the control you have i wish i did but but i don't uh and it you know it i just don't want to get into that situation again so we'll	3821	A
oh that's it see and that's even with my gas card you know i find that i'll go in to get some gas and i'll end up buying you know	3821	A
candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and i'm thinking what did i get	3821	A
that costs so much	3821	A
and	3821	A
yeah	3821	A
that that's true but i can i can understand- certainly understand where	3821	A
you know	3821	A
oh yeah isn't it that's unbelievable how let me ask you this how how old are you	3821	A
thirty three	3821	A
okay	3821	A
you'll be thirty three this year	3821	A
you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh	3821	A
it's coming	3821	A
yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates it's uh it's unbelievable	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
oh jeez	3821	A
yeah and then you bet	3821	A
that's uh yeah i in fact i've i've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less	3821	A
uh rates	3821	A
and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know	3821	A
and i i guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh	3821	A
call you know if you've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating	3821	A
you can call your in you know your your card uh wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or i'll just go to somewhere else	3821	A
you know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good uh	3821	A
uh history with them	3821	A
they're more than willing to do that	3821	A
yeah in fact that's that's what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says that's you know he's tried it several- with several of his cards and he's just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank	3821	A
at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent	3821	A
it does not make sense for me to do that and if you won't drop my rates i'll just go ahead and send you back your card and i'll go somewhere else and get it	3821	A
uh-huh	3821	A
yeah	3821	B
is that right i i know people- i know some other people that have done that	3821	B
um	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
yeah i have- i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were	3821	B
they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies and	3821	B
they're still paying away to get out of debt	3821	B
but	3821	B
no i did just the opposite i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh	3821	B
parents' footsteps i have quite a few of them i use them continually	3821	B
but i uh i basically never charge anything i don't have the money in the bank to pay for	3821	B
and uh and i always pay them off totally every month yeah	3821	B
yeah and it you know i mean they they're just a convenience for me i don't have to get cash out of the bank and i don't have to to be writing checks and and uh	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
yeah uh-huh	3821	B
yeah i mean it it's easy i mean you- you know you don't have anything transferring just a little signature so what you know	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
right	3821	B
surprising	3821	B
yeah well you know but the i mean there are sort some inherent limits there you're not going to you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that right	3821	B
now i with- the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know not so much discipline i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly	3821	B
that i	3821	B
i'm uh thirty three	3821	B
thirty two excuse me	3821	B
yeah	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
you know i just that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest and and my wife recently uh	3821	B
decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off and she's from there and and uh didn't really have the money but you know she could pay it off and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards but she's paying it and uh	3821	B
i just won't do it i mean she's paying i don't know i don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money i'll go to the bank and uh	3821	B
oh yeah	3821	B
right	3821	B
right	3821	B
yeah	3821	B
right	3821	B
huh	3821	B
well i might	3821	B
um	3821	B
right	3821	B
hum i might try that because i i have one card that i've had for about uh	3821	B
i don't know nine or ten years	3821	B
uh-huh	3821	B
right	3821	B
yeah for me the big thing you know is the uh uh	3821	B
is the uh the annual fee and i just refuse i won't get any card now i've i've got a good rating and i've got you know and i'm not going i'm not going to pay an annual fee the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first	3821	B
something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didn't uh get too much built up on it that we didn't know it was out there but	3180	A
we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable	3180	A
uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off	3180	A
uh	3180	A
right	3180	A
yeah it's it's strange that that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine	3180	A
i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because	3180	A
that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent	3180	A
right	3180	A
the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of your- all your purchases back	3180	A
but they had a uh a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee	3180	A
if you use it at a uh	3180	A
a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so that would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh	3180	A
that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i- i hardly i never have that i know of	3180	A
um-hum	3180	A
yep	3180	A
and if you happen to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh	3180	A
the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's there's several opportunities to use the uh	3180	A
card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around	3180	A
and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them_1	3180	A
i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i- i guess i	3180	A
i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had	3180	A
hum	3180	A
yeah	3180	A
i guess that's the way they	3180	A
planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to uh	3180	A
i do seem to recall	3180	A
uh	3180	A
oh i- i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh	3180	A
gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places- places were closed it was after hours as it were and	3180	A
there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open	3180	A
which which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card	3180	B
yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have	3180	B
you know eighteen percent some of them_1 even higher	3180	B
and uh uh you know it it's some of them are almost uh usurious	3180	B
so	3180	B
right	3180	B
yeah it's like my uh ATM card	3180	B
if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and it's down in the lobby i've got a these automatic teller machines then it's very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there	3180	B
but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars	3180	B
for that transaction which i thought gosh	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
yeah	3180	B
do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash	3180	B
yeah that's- well that's that's not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that	3180	B
when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me	3180	B
and uh	3180	B
uh	3180	B
you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money before it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card	3180	B
uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been uh quite so expensive	3180	B
and hello there so i guess the question is do you have any pets what do you have	3122	A
a cat named	3122	A
Bounce	3122	A
Bounce the third okay	3122	A
and the name stuck with you	3122	A
okay	3122	A
very good	3122	A
a rabbit	3122	A
and i assume that now the rabbit doesn't get out right the rabbit's in in the cage okay	3122	A
one- now do you just have one rabbit in other words it never multiplies okay	3122	A
well i've i've had uh i had three Cocker Spaniels uh up until about	3122	A
um four or five- i guess about four years ago and they they were all very old twelve thirteen and fourteen- fifteen and they died and but i believe the a child must have a	3122	A
pet to grow up with so on my uh kid's fourth birthday his birthday present was a Basset Hound	3122	A
which as he calls it a basket hound but that's okay yes but uh anyway so yes we have the Basset Hound who is now two years old and in fact it just had the lovely uh	3122	A
yesterday i got to take the dog to the veterinarian for his shots	3122	A
that's one of the uh to me one of the things i don't care about having a pet about	3122	A
no he's an outdoor dog uh he's a very low maintenance dog uh we actually have a uh an automatic feeder and we have an automatic waterer so he always has plenty of water	3122	A
so i don't have to worry about going out there and like for example i'm going on this two week vacation he'll be fine	3122	A
no one even has to look after him although we have a neighbor who's going to come over you know say hello just to keep him happy but uh	3122	A
he's in a very well fenced backyard that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and chase the kids and he likes that	3122	A
claw	3122	A
now has it been declawed	3122	A
it has not oh you should	3122	A
have you ever thought of having it	3122	A
okay okay	3122	A
true true true	3122	A
now my wife would very much like to have a cat because_1 she she grew up with a cat then uh the cat lived indoors and the whole bit i just don't care for cats i don't know what it is about it but she- i guess because	3122	A
yes they are	3122	A
you can't say come here i mean it just doesn't you know	3122	A
hum	3122	A
well we have a humongous uh our back what do you call it the uh living room has nothing but	3122	A
one big window after another so it's all windows and we can look out in the backyard and we're always seeing the dog and the dog you know he's	3122	A
he he knows when we're in the room because when we're in the room and just come- walking down the hall whatnot he'll come and and look at us you know we'll wave at him he'll come back to you you know yeah	3122	A
yes he is he's very- most loving dog you've ever had i can't i can't really i cannot imagine not having a dog	3122	A
well what you have to do is have an indoor dog	3122	A
and they can be very nice too after- after they've been trained	3122	A
and they do require a lot of training	3122	A
now my dog he you know we've got him trained that we could bring him inside but once we bought the new house my wife said uh-huh no no he's not coming inside this house so	3122	A
um-hum	3122	A
and they do get the carpet uh soiled sometimes-	3122	A
yes	3122	A
well i tell you what i've got some uh carpet uh cleaner that uh you know it's some type of dog smell- smell away it works wonderful it really really does	3122	A
oh	3122	A
oh come on	3122	A
now this is from a cat or a dog	3122	A
okay	3122	A
because_1 yes dogs need training but cats usually don't even need any training seem like they automatically go to their little litter box they think yeah	3122	A
well in fact if we're getting ready to go on our vacation my little six year old now he's saying we need to buy a mother dog to take care of uh	3122	A
Copper while we're gone i said you don't buy mother dogs you buy little puppies	3122	A
and- and and my wife's saying uh-huh no	3122	A
well we had three at one time we had three in the backyard all at one time- and they played they also humped on each other all the time but you know they	3122	A
oh they did	3122	A
although i'll tell you what it really would scare me like now in the summer when this hot uh when they're playing that hard i you know it's i'm not sure if that was that good for them_1 or not	3122	A
but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a	3122	A
the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside and he is constantly chasing the kids and people walk in our neighborhood he's always and we're on the corner too so you know he has a lot of traffic going by and he	3122	A
hi	3122	B
yes we well we have a cat yes named Bounce actually it's Bounce the uh about third	3122	B
yeah uh that's because when i was little i had a storybook about a cat named Bounce and	3122	B
and the cat was um gray and white in particular had to be gray and white so all the Bounces have been gray and white we also have a rabbit	3122	B
named Coco Bunny	3122	B
right the rabbit is in a cage outdoors only year round	3122	B
one rabbit	3122	B
No that's for sure and uh that's actually all the pets we have at this time	3122	B
how about you	3122	B
um hum um-hum	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
right	3122	B
oh	3122	B
oh yeah cute	3122	B
uh-huh	3122	B
oh boy	3122	B
did-	3122	B
right yeah does he live indoors or outdoors- outdoor yeah that's kind of	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
um	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
ooh how nice	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
he's just in the fenced backyard and	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
well how nice	3122	B
yeah that sounds like a good situation that's about how i would like to have a dog if i had a dog	3122	B
see our cat is also um well outdoors and in the garage	3122	B
at one time she was an indoor cat and then she started to do things in the house that i didn't appreciate	3122	B
no no no no well-	3122	B
well no because_1 she's outdoors	3122	B
so if she's outdoors i don't want her declawed	3122	B
um but she um she was kind of a feisty- feisty- feisty little character when she was little and as she has gotten older because_1 she's about seven years old	3122	B
would she	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
yeah well they're so independent a lot of people don't i	3122	B
that's true it could just stand there and stare at you in a strange way in fact my cat right now is just rubbing up against the the wood on the door here staring-	3122	B
with a look of don't you want	3122	B
to feed me or to pick me up and love me <b_aside> yes you sweet thing <e_aside>	3122	B
um-hum um-hum	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
so he is sociable even though he even though he's outdoors yeah	3122	B
yeah my boys and um my husband have been talking recently about having a dog but we don't have a a fenced in backyard	3122	B
and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park	3122	B
and we just you know one reason we	3122	B
yeah i guess it would have to be and we	3122	B
yeah that's true	3122	B
yeah well that's right	3122	B
yeah yeah that's for sure	3122	B
uh-hum um well pets	3122	B
pets really are hard on houses i mean there's just no doubt about that we've my husband was in really estate for a while and	3122	B
you know he had more problems over pets um in both rental houses and houses that people owned and other people looked at it and didn't like the way it smelled and so so that's my main	3122	B
objection	3122	B
yeah i mean even- even the best trained one you know is going to have problems from time to time and you just can't really get that that smell out and	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
well that's good when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it and um we did not realize that there was a problem and after we moved in it was	3122	B
so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house	3122	B
and uh when they pulled the carpeting up it was so bad on the back there were so many spots you just wouldn't believe and um they- they we had to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete slab	3122	B
and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then got- took took that well actually both	3122	B
that- um took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that and we had to stay out of the house for	3122	B
you know ten hours or something and then we came back and then they put the new carpet down there moved the furniture back to that half of the house and had- had to do it again	3122	B
yeah no they usually don't yeah yeah so anyway we've had that that was a very bad experience well i don't really think we're going to have any more indoor pets	3122	B
so they'd have company right well it really is fun to have two pets together um-hum yeah	3122	B
yeah	3122	B
yeah but they must really have fun together it it's cute to see several- several at a time like that	3122	B
oh yeah	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
just the kids	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
um-hum	3122	B
how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army	3104	B
oh lord	3104	B
that is an army i came from a family of six	3104	B
and i have only got two and they're one	3104	B
well i kind of decided that single single children that that	3104	B
that's not parenting that's a hobby but	3104	B
well don't tell that to all my friends	3104	B
they're into quality time i'm just into getting through the day	3104	B
well i- i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people's kids you know when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids	3104	B
that are usually in day care and you can spot them because_1 they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around	3104	B
yeah really	3104	B
it's not a problem for my two they're only eighteen months apart	3104	B
they can	3104	B
they can find things to do and mess around and and	3104	B
plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college	3104	B
well how did you go about selecting a college then	3104	B
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at	3104	B
