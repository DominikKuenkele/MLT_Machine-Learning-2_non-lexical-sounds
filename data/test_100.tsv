uh two of them_1 worked there and two of them_1 came to pick them_1 up when they got off their at at eleven o'clock that night and	3795	B
right or just shutting down just closing and i don't think the police have a clue uh they've had the FBI here and have some sort of analysis of who might have done it what type of person might have done it but	3795	B
yeah but	3795	B
it's just they're still begging for help and and and i just feel like some of they're helpless at uh trying to solve this one	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
that's true my wife and i read a lot of uh true crime books and you know court cases things like that	3795	B
and it boy it just upsets us when people get off with little or nothing they're they're on they're out on probation- probation in fifteen years after murdering half a dozen people and	3795	B
it's just not fair	3795	B
yes	3795	B
yeah i think about a year ago here in Austin they were we were uh the gang problem was getting real bad and they hired a hundred new policemen and a lot of them_1 were dedicated just to the crime unit or to the gang unit	3795	B
and just recently they announced that they've pretty much got it under control there was only one gang related murder this past year	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
i think one of the things that they need to do more of which i seen a little bit here in Austin though is getting actual people in neighborhoods involved	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
yeah uh	3795	B
seems to be that way i seems like everybody that we've heard of or know that go for any kind of psychiatric- psychiatric help uh every problem you've got is blamed on your parents	3795	B
and that to me that's just defeating the family right there	3795	B
i mean if you can	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
you know	3795	B
you know out of my own family i- i guess maybe i didn't have everything i wanted when i was growing up but i've as i've gotten older i've learned to accept the fact that i got what i needed i was clothed and sheltered and educated and	3795	B
i haven't blamed any of my future problems on on on the family upbringing or whatever	3795	B
yeah	3795	B
it's just i like i can't ever imagine my son committing a crime	3795	B
and i think he knows that you know that that's just something that not in in his world but there's so many people out there that do commit violent crimes and and small crimes and think nothing of it it's	3795	B
uh	3795	A
actually about anything you can imagine uh from you- you know this petty theft kind of crud going around vandalism up to uh certain amount of organized crime where uh	3795	A
gangs are starting to you know show up and actually you know qualify as gangs	3795	A
uh about_1 fifty- yeah right around fifty thousand we i think we- this census we just missed fifty thousand by a couple of people or something like that	3795	A
but uh yeah it's it's right at fifty thousand	3795	A
um-hum	3795	A
murdered and mutilated	3795	A
uh what these are girls who worked at this ice cream parlor or	3795	A
all right so this- so this is a place the the place had shut down already	3795	A
um	3795	A
yeah character profile psychiatric profile	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
ah shoot the the big problem is there's no real punishment for crime anymore i mean the bigger the crime the less likely you are to get punished for it	3795	A
i mean get adequately punished anyway	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
well they slaughter innocent- innocent- lots of innocent lives and they get you know a few years and a slap on the wrist and someone else turns around and you know embezzles a couple of thousand dollars from the local bank and they you know they practically get fried	3795	A
yes	3795	A
um-hum	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
that's good if nothing else they've got the gangs pushed down to where they're you know not going to be very active at least as far as you know murders or open crimes are concerned	3795	A
yeah the neighborhood watch type programs yeah that's one that's the one thing that starting you know the only two things that are really making a difference	3795	A
are when the local people get involved and when they start doing something positive with families families have gone in the toilet in the last twenty thirty years	3795	A
and it's as though they're really trying to push to make sure they go down the toilet lot of people- lot of institutions they seem to be fighting against family	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah well to a certain extent it can be traced back there and and and that's okay to say so as long as you understand that you got to forgive	3795	A
it's not like they doing it on purpose usually very seldom are they doing it on purpose	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
i had some modicum at least of acceptance and support	3795	A
yeah well that's the way it was with us we had i had a pretty good family life by comparison- i had an excellent family life by comparison to a lot of people out there	3795	A
it may not have been perfect but they did what they knew how to do and they did it the best they knew how so	3795	A
yeah	3795	A
yeah i mean considering the conscious it seems to go it- it- it almost invariably does start with the destruction of the family i mean	3795	A
almost invariably children aren't taught respect they're not taught discipline they're not taught the need to	3795	A
see in the newspaper or on the news when uh President Bush fainted at a dinner it was that in Japan	3726	A
um	3726	A
well i thought it was pretty scary i i missed it uh i mean i when they were rerunning- rerunning it like the next day or something mean i didn't hear about it on the day it happened but i	3726	A
it was interesting you know that when he fainted and every one kind of jumped up on the table and surrounded him and it's really amazing that that would happen and then of course all the Dan Quayle discussion comes up again	3726	A
that's uh that is true that is real good well he you know as for as young as he is he seems to have had several health problems- you know health uh incidences if not problems	3726	A
right that's right well i um	3726	A
i guess i haven't really been i've been trying to tune out a lot of the political issues right now when because the campaigning is starting and uh so	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
right	3726	A
it is scary	3726	A
yes	3726	A
uh-huh	3726	A
right they're foreign students	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
well they seem	3726	A
well that's really true and but i have noticed from uh my associations with teenagers in high school that they are really motivated by how much money they can make and when they hear on the news about people being laid off	3726	A
and uh you know corporations and things i mean i feel like they don't wanna make the effort out of um their own personal interests to follow a particular field or they wanna think you know how quickly can they make money	3726	A
and they're not attracted by the the work that has to be done to achieve	3726	A
uh you know a position like that	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
right	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
um-hum	3726	A
well you're right when you say that um	3726	A
the important issues need to be not so as much what's going on other places i mean that it's important for us to do	3726	A
i mean we we can't be isolated here but um you know we do need to pay more attention to our own economy and	3726	A
and our own civilization because we've seen how quickly and it's almost unbelievable the fall of the um Soviet Union and and the um Berlin Wall and all of that's almost unreal to me still	3726	A
that was in Japan uh i didn't get to see that uh we've uh just gotten back yesterday from vacation	3726	B
and so i was bumping up and down the highway in a camper and uh i didn't get to watch any television so i've just been finding out about this once i got back	3726	B
yeah well i was kind of pleased that uh when i got back that that was the hot item on the news that uh the President had fainted at dinner because_1 that means that nothing else happened anywhere in the world	3726	B
yeah well you need about three kids running around the house and uh you you'd have your share of health problem too	3726	B
yeah	3726	B
well i think the key issue that's going on at the moment is the current economy	3726	B
and i think there's a lot of things that need to be done to to rectify that situation i'm not sure that the government is the key player	3726	B
um	3726	B
i think one of the statements that was made uh a year ago by uh Gorbachev	3726	B
when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the Soviet Union he made the comment he said well our country may be bankrupt but referring to the United States he says your schools are bankrupt	3726	B
and uh that's been a big concern for me	3726	B
and i noticed that uh when i go into the tougher courses at some of the universities like Organic Chemistry or something like that	3726	B
that uh you don't find very many white American males taking the tough courses	3726	B
you find you find a lot of Asian students uh you find uh a lot of females in the class	3726	B
and in all of the tough courses that i have taken the only blacks that i've found in the class have have generally been from Nigeria or some other African country they're foreign students	3726	B
and it's i think it's kind of pathetic that uh	3726	B
our kids are not motivated to uh	3726	B
to study in depth and uh to take the hard courses and i'm i'm concerned that that is our economic problem not not how much money is being spent at Christmas time	3726	B
um-hum	3726	B
yeah well i know when i went through school uh i went through an engineering school and of all my close friends they were all there because they loved engineering	3726	B
they loved building things they loved solving problems uh they liked	3726	B
you know being creative and there was another group of students there that were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of money	3726	B
and we didn't mix very well you know there was a a total difference in attitude and we felt very	3726	B
isolated or uh discriminated against in not being you know separate classes in terms of attitude	3726	B
um-hum	3726	B
yeah	3726	B
well that was a terribly precarious economy- economy uh i've been kind of watching it over the years and observing that the the amount of bureaucracy over there	3726	B
uh where did you go	3762	A
well interestingly enough i'm calling from Miami	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
well yeah	3762	A
well you know that's something i've never done is go down to the Keys although i i'm just here on business but uh i would love to go down there	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be	3762	A
when i was a kid uh we used to go camping up in the Ozarks in Arkansas	3762	A
and uh we found a pretty remote campground uh uh actually whenever we first started going to it you had to drive about twenty five miles on a gravel road	3762	A
to get back up into it and uh it had uh no electricity and uh it had a hand pump for water	3762	A
but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you	3762	A
but uh that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping	3762	A
yeah well now yeah you kind of remind me of a friend of mine who who said her idea of roughing it is slow room service	3762	A
but uh yeah i've got a uh i've got a friend of mine in Houston who has a forty two foot uh Tartan sailboat	3762	A
and uh it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because he's got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on it	3762	A
well that's hard work	3762	A
yeah i've i've been with it on on several uh races we've run the Pensacola yacht race for a couple of years	3762	A
and uh but no i love to sail and i agree i had never thought- really thought about that as camping before but that is- that is probably one of the best ways to go	3762	A
what did you do did you rent a motor home when you came to Florida	3762	A
was it what is that expensive	3762	A
well that's cheaper than a hotel room really	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
how big was the one you rented	3762	A
yeah was that uh any problem driving or	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
oh really	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah yeah	3762	A
oh sure yeah yeah that always irritates me when i pass somebody several times i've i've been in the other in the other uh uh uh had the shoe on the other foot	3762	A
uh-huh	3762	A
yeah	3762	A
yeah right right right	3762	A
uh	3762	A
no we just uh i guess i'm hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping	3762	B
in a recreational vehicle	3762	B
we took a tour of Florida	3762	B
okay well i was down there visiting the uh the orchid jungle	3762	B
there in uh Homestead	3762	B
came back with about ten plants that i hadn't planned on	3762	B
yeah we were down past Miami went down into the Keys	3762	B
um well we found it a little bit of a disappointment uh we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy	3762	B
and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh	3762	B
uh well Key West was uh just coral rubble	3762	B
and uh we did find Bahia Honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach	3762	B
but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to to go in and and snorkel and and do those sort of things	3762	B
um-hum	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
hum	3762	B
well my uh my wife talks a lot about camping and uh she's taken the girls uh on off to Girl Scout camp a couple of times	3762	B
but my idea of camping is in a either an RV or in a thirty- thirty five foot sailboat	3762	B
right	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that uh was doing a lot of racing	3762	B
and uh and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable	3762	B
um-hum	3762	B
yeah	3762	B
yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America	3762	B
uh it was running about eighty seven dollars a day	3762	B
that's cheaper than a hotel and you add uh oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site	3762	B
and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth	3762	B
we had a uh thirty two footer	3762	B
well it's it's a big truck uh but uh	3762	B
when you get that big a truck the uh the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five	3762	B
so uh i just uh had a change of mind set and i would set the uh autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you	3762	B
and you just stay in the right lane and there's nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it	3762	B
so it's kind of a pleasant way to drive you	3762	B
uh i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one	3762	B
yeah because_1 you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know he's got a colorful car that you recognize and	3762	B
the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich	3762	B
and uh well we enjoyed it uh one of of places we visited was uh Walt Disney World	3762	B
oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook	3791	A
don't like to cook huh	3791	A
make a mean spaghetti huh	3791	A
uh got kids married- married	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
well uh my wife and i we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet	3791	A
uh	3791	A
uh uh yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that	3791	A
let's see a good dinner party menu	3791	A
i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming i guess	3791	A
i don't know	3791	A
uh something light and easy if it was pretty informal- informal about_1 anything	3791	A
roast chicken	3791	A
oh gosh yeah how do you usually cook your deer how do you usually cook your deer	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
i imagine	3791	A
i would imagine it is	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah i understand	3791	A
we just had uh	3791	A
deer stew sort of uh deer- deer steak stew	3791	A
um	3791	A
what was it about	3791	A
a day day and a half in the crock pot um uh some deer steaks	3791	A
in kind of a mushroom gravy	3791	A
um some veggies and a	3791	A
delicious no no the times i've been out deer hunting i- i- i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa	3791	A
i mean i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles	3791	A
so no this- this was given to us by some friends	3791	A
um guy was in a uh	3791	A
in a hunting club	3791	A
and you know but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it's split with the rest with everybody in the group	3791	A
well he wound- they they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit so there's everybody had deer coming out their ears	3791	A
so	3791	A
no	3791	A
we we either crock pot deer or we'll uh you know put it out on the grill so that so that the bulk of the uh tallow will dribble off of it	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah that is good	3791	A
deer spaghetti is real good	3791	A
anyway um	3791	A
no i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have uh	3791	A
sandwiches or	3791	A
something along those lines and then uh	3791	A
um	3791	A
you know just something light finger food sort of something or	3791	A
or maybe have something roasting out on a fire	3791	A
oh well anyway um we don't do much in the way of entertaining but usually it's one other couple come over for a dinner	3791	A
let's see what did we have the last time we had guests over ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf	3791	A
was kind of taco turkey loaf	3791	A
uh it was good	3791	A
uh scalloped potatoes and	3791	A
no it was mashed potatoes mashed potatoes with uh melted- cheese melted over the top of them_1	3791	A
a couple things like that	3791	A
it was pretty good little dinner	3791	A
yeah usually the kind	3791	A
oh don't you hate that	3791	A
yeah i've got a i got a a few pounds to lose myself	3791	A
that's okay i've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old	3791	A
yeah	3791	A
yeah i was- was a left fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade- grade at two	3791	A
none to cook i don't like to cook spaghetti i guess though i make a mean spaghetti	3791	B
yeah	3791	B
no huh-uh just my husband and i and the two dogs so what about yours	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
hm	3791	B
so i guess it's supposed to be dinner party is that what they said	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
huh	3791	B
we don't	3791	B
thank you	3791	B
um-hum um-hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
well sometimes we'll have uh we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer	3791	B
huh	3791	B
how do we usually on the grill we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill and it is good	3791	B
real good	3791	B
either that or hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
ooh	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
ooh	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B

uh-huh	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
oh well that's nice	3791	B
uh-huh	3791	B
yeah we still got some from last year	3791	B
yeah	3791	B
um-hum um-hum	3791	B
yeah we have- we usually have most of it made into uh hamburger meat though	3791	B
and cook you know spaghetti with it chili	3791	B
so	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
yeah yeah	3791	B
a hum	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
oh	3791	B
ooh	3791	B
um-hum	3791	B
hm	3791	B
hm sounds good this isn't a good topic for me right now i'm on a diet	3791	B
yeah i have too i was real skinny till i was ten	3791	B
okay what um	3728	B
do you watch much TV or	3728	B
you know	3728	B
the news yeah	3728	B
uh-huh	3728	B
oh uh-huh	3728	B
yeah	3728	B
um-hum	3728	B
yeah yeah now i also i get it from all over i watch the news every day and i have- we have a news you know we get the newspaper and uh	3728	B
um	3728	B
magazines anything- anything you know i'm i read a lot so i get um you know i'm i'm really up on uh current affairs i get you know	3728	B
the news and and everything	3728	B
um well i'm not getting any- no i'm not getting any news magazines but um	3728	B
you know as- as i said i do	3728	B
uh it's uh it's easy to keep up on current events- you know on certainly- you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day	3728	B
and uh	3728	B
and i don't know you know what what's i mean what what are we supposed to uh	3728	B
compare it to you know i mean the quality uh	3728	B
whatever they tell you you know i uh	3728	B
i guess i'm uh i you know i'm satisfied i mean i uh	3728	B
you- you- you know they're they're supposedly covering everything that happens so you know	3728	B
oh really	3728	B
oh	3728	B
well uh sometimes it's such a you know it's it's so um	3728	B
slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the	3728	B
paper but most of the time- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there uh you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it	3728	B
but um	3728	B
oh well that's what sells papers	3728	B
that's um that's been like that since they the first newspaper you know	3728	B
you know but um	3728	B
i don't know i- i guess i'm satisfied i don't uh	3728	B
i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really we don't get a you know	3728	B
oh yeah i was gonna	3728	B
sure	3728	B
yeah sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad	3728	B
it's all so negative you know	3728	B
but	3728	B
well we have to keep talking i guess	3728	B
oh	3728	B
oh is it really	3728	B
well yeah i don't i don't uh	3728	B
i don't know we're supposed- i guess we're supposed to wait or	3728	B
i don't know	3728	B
cause- i you know like one well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening	3728	B
yeah and it was really we were laughing i mean but you know we don't really do any gardening so like that took like a minute	3728	B
and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean	3728	B
you know i mean some topics really now you know now this topic this is i mean there really isn't much to say after	3728	B
you know you uh you you know you you tell a person what uh news their a	3728	B
you know where their where they find their sources of of information from and then you know if if it's uh if they're satisfied and that's about it really	3728	B
it's hard to talk for five minutes on this	3728	B
so um	3728	B
um no i don't watch much TV sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news but i don't think of that every day even	3728	A
um i think i get most of my current events well i get them from everywhere i sometimes watch TV if i- i guess i watch TV if i haven't read the paper that day we don't get a paper but i work um	3728	A
at a i teach college class and uh there's a the library has a paper and so i often drop in on a break and	3728	A
and read it and then i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home	3728	A
and then i i figure if there's big big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah what's your favorite news do you do you get a news magazine or	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah we've got	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah exactly are you satisfied with the quality of coverage	3728	A
yeah it's kind of hard to know isn't it	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah yeah well i do feel like a little bit like being from California and	3728	A
wanting to hear like i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something and i don't ever hear it in the news here you know it's um	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah yeah	3728	A
yeah i sometimes feel like um the Dallas paper and the Dallas News	3728	A
um the top headlines are always a murder you know and that's because there's a high crime rate yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah yeah i'm sure	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
yeah really	3728	A
that's true we certainly get enough coverage i mean we we-	3728	A
we can get news you know i mean there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day so	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
often times	3728	A
so	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
well no i guess we can end yeah it's just whenever we're	3728	A
um yeah have you always gone until the recording	3728	A
uh-huh oops i guess we're not supposed to	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
oh really it just	3728	A
uh-huh	3728	A
uh-huh interesting yeah	3728	A
um-hum	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
um-hum	3728	A
yeah	3728	A
yeah well i guess i can just say i uh it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that	3728	A
well it seems like i don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um you know you'll hear one report and then you'll hear that it you know they didn't um	3728	A
did you hear our topic and it's in regards to discussing homes	3773	A
yeah i'm settled in a place i've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight	3773	A
in it's in Richardson Texas which is North Texas or North Dallas	3773	A
and we've lived in two houses in Richardson we moved here in seventy four and uh changed locations in seventy eight	3773	A
how about_1 yourself	3773	A
yes nice area	3773	A
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or	3773	A
oh boy	3773	A
right- right	3773	A
sure	3773	A
no we're settled and uh	3773	A
we're uh	3773	A
i'm probably older than you i'm fifty two but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year and graduating college so i can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe	3773	A
oh gosh so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere closer closer to our families	3773	A
no i'm from West Virginia but everyone's uh my wife's parents are from the New York New Jersey area	3773	A
so but everyone seems uh has seemed to relocated down that area seems like a nice place to go	3773	A
oh i understand you need very minimum of four and probably five	3773	A
as far	3773	A
right	3773	A
it's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isn't it	3773	A
right	3773	A
matter of looking right	3773	A
lot of people will buy a four- in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had uh there were seven kids in her family	3773	A
oh sure	3773	A
oh i know and it's there's nothing harder than that i always just sort of a	3773	A
assign my wife that chore then i would let her narrow it down to three or four then i'd go look because	3773	A
women seem to like to look a lot more than men do	3773	A
yes	3773	A
why certainly	3773	A
i understand that	3773	A
i'm in the uh sporting goods business i'm a manufacturer's rep i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies	3773	A
who- who are you with	3773	A
uh-huh	3773	A
well great	3773	A
how how was the uh you say- you say you lived in the Denver area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing- housing prices	3773	A
no kidding	3773	A
homes yes sir um-hum	3773	B
what are are you settled in a place	3773	B
right um-hum	3773	B
okay	3773	B
well we uh left here in seventy six uh we were here for a few years then we uh have come back just this summer right now we're looking for housing	3773	B
uh somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area are you familiar that	3773	B
yeah it is the kids are in school here in Duncanville we're in a temporary place right now and uh so they've enjoyed the school so we're kind of trying to stay here but	3773	B
well what the problem we got is that we've got five children	3773	B
and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing so we uh	3773	B
we look at the paper we look at our talk to our realtor and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five are you looking or you settled i mean having- having finished	3773	B
oh great	3773	B
that empty nest syndrome is gonna set in i guess	3773	B
great	3773	B
okay	3773	B
okay you are you from Florida originally	3773	B
yeah	3773	B
oh yeah	3773	B
yeah yeah we've got five and the oldest is uh ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and i think they're gonna be uh with us forever	3773	B
i don't know if that's true but it's sure you know we're- we're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size we're we're trying to find the	3773	B
oh yeah in fact six would be real good my wife and i can share a bedroom and there	3773	B
oh i don't think it's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that yeah	3773	B
oh yeah	3773	B
yeah it is yeah we're- um we're having actually	3773	B
if we find something for uh i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know that's uh but i think the thing's out there it's just a matter of uh	3773	B
you know looking you know finding the right place uh	3773	B
wow	3773	B
oh yeah yeah i think once we get into a place it'll be just fine but um you know it's until then it's uh	3773	B
oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing that's all	3773	B
oh yeah maybe that's the case at least she's got more opinions you know there's uh	3773	B
seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know	3773	B
so what- what kind of business are you in	3773	B
oh yeah great	3773	B
uh we're with an organization called uh Wycliffe Bible Translators it's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing	3773	B
uh it's got an office down here in uh it near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so	3773	B
it	3773	B
right	3773	B
uh we were uh	3773	B
really surprised to find that they're higher here uh	3773	B
when we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not	3773	B
i guess um	3773	B
really prices for housing are just	3773	B
okay uh personal computer- i don't have a personal computer i'd like to have one if i had more money i'd have one	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
is it is it hard to find uh compatible pieces for your the one you have at home	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
oh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month they're coming out with something new and so then you're not compatible- oh yeah	3783	A
uh even with like the computer games Nintendo and that kind of stuff i mean they change it every year and the the previous game or the previous program or whatever isn't compatible	3783	A
oh	3783	A
oh okay	3783	A
well that isn't that doesn't sound too bad	3783	A
um not really not in my work um i did try and take a class um i think last was it last spring	3783	A
no actually it was last fall it was at at i took desktop publishing i just wanted to get sort of a a slight feel for it and it was just an introduction course	3783	A
and it was pretty fascinating we we learned how to do how to make a brochure type thing out out- off- off the computer so it was pretty interesting	3783	A
oh so you've yeah	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
now the Lotus is for mostly numbers and graphs and things like that right yeah	3783	A
i'm not real good with computers at all and that's mainly because i don't use them i wish i did i'd be you know	3783	A
more up on it	3783	A
oh my goodness yes	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
have you heard about the phone that uh believe it's AT and T	3783	A
uh is it AT and T that's coming out with the phone with the like on the Jetsons when you could see the you could see the person's face	3783	A
have you seen that yeah	3783	A
yeah yeah i saw that in a in a magazine recently i was really shocked yeah	3783	A
oh i know hopefully you can	3783	A
have control over whether they can see you or not	3783	A
but it looked pretty nice and it's only gonna be two thousand dollars so which is not bad for something new like that so	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
oh	3783	A
my mother does a lot of work on computers and she taps into computers all over the world she works at at she works at TI and uh	3783	A
yeah uh-huh and uh you know she talks to people through the computer from everywhere so i think i think that's really neat too	3783	A
okay uh-huh	3783	A
maybe she knows my mother because_1 my mother used to work in Plano now she works in uh north Dallas i think so	3783	A
but	3783	A
uh-huh	3783	A
i visited with some kids in elementary school and nowadays a lot of the schools have computers and the kids are really they're more interested in their schoolwork	3783	A
with the computer you know they can also play games but then they can help them write papers and helps with their math and that kind of thing	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
and there's always something new even if you know even if you think you know everything about the computer there's always one button	3783	A
that you never quite use and you don't really know what it's for and you know it can be fascinating in that way too especially for a kid that you know is just learning so	3783	A
well hopefully i'll be able to get a computer at some point i don't know when but i don't need one right now	3783	A
but there's gonna come a time i'm sure when everybody's gonna have to have one	3783	A
oh yeah	3783	A
um-hum	3783	A
yeah	3783	A
uh-huh i've got one	3783	B
i do have one but it's a kind of an old one that uh they didn't use at work any longer it's not the not the greatest one but uh i use one at work quite a bit all day long in fact	3783	B
yeah because_1 it's a little bit older and uh it's a it's a Wang machine and Wang was you know a leader a while ago but now they're kind of out of it	3783	B
what's that	3783	B
oh yeah constantly- constantly changing	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
most of the uh you know WordPerfect and Lotus and those kinds of programs you can subscribe to an update service for about_1 fifty dollars a year i think they'll give you the the next release of their software	3783	B
and but uh	3783	B
yeah do you use one much	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
sure uh-huh	3783	B
oh	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
yeah oh i'm a CPA and i use it almost all the time for this Lotus program i'll have -well lot of good applications for what i have to do	3783	B
yeah or uh spreadsheets and that type of thing yeah it's	3783	B
huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
oh yeah uh-huh when you have a vision with the sound uh-huh	3783	B
oh really	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
uh-huh	3783	B
well you know they've got these uh all these modems- uh computers have modems in them_1 now where you can call all over the place uh	3783	B
i can do a fair amount of work from home and tap into our company's main computer system without much trouble	3783	B
uh-huh this is uh how you got signed up for it uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah well i have a sister lives in Plano that's my connection with the project	3783	B
oh uh-huh	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
but i you know there are i've got a six year old and i think he's	3783	B
he's got quite a bit of interest in uh in playing around with the one we have at home and it's not a it's not a real fun one it's not a color or i don't have much in the way of game software	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah i think it	3783	B
yeah you know adds a dimension that uh probably makes learning a little bit more fun if you get to you know	3783	B
try things a little different than just the standard pencil and paper and crayons	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
um-hum	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
yeah	3783	B
oh i think that day'll happen i'm hoping and perhaps uh what'll ultimately happen is you won't have to commute as much but you'll be able to do so much from home	3783	B
that uh you know you won't have to be driving around like-	3783	B
well you know there's uh the uh the the the one that's burning in everybody's uh	3744	B
in everybody's mind the uh break up of the Soviet Union and it's a	3744	B
ah it's- it's it's effects here at home	3744	B
i mean it's gonna have effects all over the world and uh	3744	B
course you know i- i expect uh in the next few days when uh the president gives his uh State of the Union address	3744	B
he's got to have to uh	3744	B
pull some uh	3744	B
real drastic changes in what he's doing to to promote some	3744	B
some movement and enthusiasm behind his reelection race	3744	B
yeah	3744	B
yeah well they- they they focused all of their economic capacity on on on their military	3744	B
i mean if they had focused the same capacity in their uh commercial stuff they would've been a lot better off as a society probably uh	3744	B
yes like the Japanese right	3744	B
and	3744	B
um-hum	3744	B
well uh you know five- five years ago could you have- have imagined in your in your your wildest dreams that something as as a change as rapid as this would've occurred	3744	B
it's just you know it it's almost unthinkable but it it is hey in a i i still wonder whether you know that it's going to be stable and then what's going to happen there	3744	B
but i don't think the shelves -is bare anymore	3744	B
i think there's now you know i think all the time there were goods	3744	B
to to be distributed that were being held off	3744	B
and uh	3744	B
you know i- i i think that uh	3744	B
there's still- but but you know the the people don't have a lot of money to pay for them there there's a tremendous uh	3744	B
gap in their ability to to supply themselves uh uh that could create a tremendous amount of political stability- instability in fact they said tonight on the on the radio uh that	3744	B
uh	3744	B
some some leader in in in of- of the parliament in- in Russia is calling for Yeltsin to essentially throw out all of his ministers and replace them	3744	B
because of this- this tremendous supply demand uh type gap that they have there	3744	B
uh	3744	B
i don't know it it's it's	3744	B
-it's hard to imagine managing such a rapid change	3744	B
well and and i think that you know we we stand uh	3744	B
in- in in the possibility of- of in of of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here uh everybody -is is calling for you know this this- this- this	3744	B
uh peace dividend and	3744	B
it the- with- with an election year coming up there's the uh that- there's the the-	3744	B
the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to to	3744	B
appeal to the voters to to- to get elected but you know how how rapidly can they change and how rapid can they move	3744	B
well you got a topic	3744	A
yeah i think- i- i think that's the obvious one isn't it	3744	A
yeah well it it's truly amazing to um see how rapidly um uh the Soviet Union fell apart um uh	3744	A
and it makes me wonder i'm not saying that i'm uh i'm certainly not a hawk necessarily	3744	A
but it makes me wonder i've thought about this if the idea of uh uh the the arms race while granted it has practically- practically bankrupted this country	3744	A
uh perhaps it did bankrupt uh Russia and was you know as a as a way of making a a a political change was certainly preferable to a war	3744	A
right	3744	A
yeah with the right kind of- the Japanese for example	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
well	3744	A
i don't know what we've we've seen so many changes just in the past five years uh it makes me think it reminds me of that book uh Future Shock	3744	A
where the the future is coming at us uh at such an accelerated pace day after day	3744	A
that only the most adaptable are gonna be able to uh survive and and keep from just being overrun by the changes	3744	A
oh no no	3744	A
it really is	3744	A
well and that's just it i i have some	3744	A
i have doubts that uh	3744	A
that it can be ah stable number one you've got uh you know you see on the news	3744	A
the the stories- the stories and the and the sights of these these the Soviet people these Russian people that are standing in line	3744	A
uh for hours on end and have for you know bare shelves at in these hugely you know uh higher prices that they have to pay now that- that government controls are off	3744	A
oh are they are they back- are they have they got some um	3744	A
but they're on the black market	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
hm	3744	A
yeah	3744	A
yeah and i don't- i don't that's just it it's funny- it's inconceivable- inconceivable to me to think that anyone or any entity i don't care	3744	A
what it is could actually manage i mean it would it's kind of like damage control and maybe putting out the biggest fires but i don't think that it's really a manageable uh of set of circumstances	3744	A
well as far as i'm concerned i can change pretty doggone rapidly and i'm all for something radical because i think it's gonna take something radical to turn this country around um	3744	A
well what kind of vacations do you like to take are you	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah where have you gone there	3768	A
um-hum	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah well i've been over there too i even let's see um mostly Germany and France i lived in France for a year and a half so	3768	A
i was able but i loved when i had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of traveling around France i went to Germany because uh i've got relatives there and i just like it there	3768	A
so but um Austria i found really pretty and Switzerland yeah and i i lived in the Alps in France so i	3768	A
anything in the mountains over there i just love	3768	A
then i finally made it to England too um on my way home um so i lived in Africa actually and on my way home from there yeah	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
so um and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from Nairobi you have to fly through um uh Europe on your way home so i went to England and i really liked it there too	3768	A
i know it's true that's the one thing	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah actually now you can get some really good deals flying over but it's once you're there you still have to spend money	3768	A
unless you know people you know	3768	A
uh-huh and- that helps a lot	3768	A
but	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh yeah	3768	A
i haven't i've been i've most of my vacationing in the US has been on the West Coast	3768	A
or this summer i went to Colorado	3768	A
and uh i'd love to go to the East Coast during the fall	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
um-hum	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh i haven't been there anywhere on the East Coast i	3768	A
i think Tennessee's been the furthest east i've been	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah i guess so	3768	A
uh-huh	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
uh-huh yeah	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah so the type of vacation you'd like i mean like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week	3768	A
yeah mainly- mainly probably because_1 you wanna see everything and yeah	3768	A
yeah i know how it is	3768	A
well i liked it um i was working in Cameroon Africa and it's not a	3768	A
it's not a place for tourists i mean they're not used to having tourists there so it's you're kind of roughing it but um i liked it i liked it the people there are just very very friendly and	3768	A
um i was working with an organization that does Bible translation	3768	A
so i was doing linguistic work actually traveling around finding out about languages and uh what they call survey work find out where the languages are	3768	A
so i traveled a lot around- around the country and met a lot of people and	3768	A
um	3768	A
yeah i enjoyed it so	3768	A
yeah	3768	A
yeah my cousin came over while i was there and she came to Cameroon then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around	3768	A
you know close to Nairobi in Kenya so she'd always dreamed of doing that too	3768	A
so	3768	A
yeah so is there anyplace you would try to talk me into going to it sounds like we've been to some of the same places but	3768	A
well we've uh we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe so	3768	B
so i i guess those are the types i like we've really enjoyed them we've gone to um Germany Switzerland Austria	3768	B
Ireland and England we've been to Germany twice but um i guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland	3768	B
uh-huh where have you been	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh that's neat	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
oh yeah	3768	B
you lived in Africa oh my goodness wow	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
it's so expensive over there	3768	B
it really is it just it's it's i love to go over there but it's so darn expensive	3768	B
to go over	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
oh i know just	3768	B
right and you can stay with them and yeah yeah	3768	B
you know there's a lot of places in the States that we haven't even gone	3768	B
you know i'd like to go to Hawaii sometime and and uh we- we made it we've we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls so	3768	B
feel like we've accomplished a little bit here	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
the oh the it's oh i've always wanted to go there i've seen pictures and and it looks gorgeous	3768	B
we um we made a trip up the East Coast it was uh in the summer and it really is pretty	3768	B
it's uh both coasts are really pretty	3768	B
but um i love the Carolinas it's just gorgeous over there	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
well you'll just have to plan a vacation sometime	3768	B
and- and- go over there yeah but it's you know there's lots to see here	3768	B
but i just love going over to Europe because_1 it's so their way of life is just so different than ours you know we're so fast paced here and	3768	B
over there you know every time we'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we always have to ask for the check	3768	B
you know they're so leisurely over there and it's kind of nice to to have that	3768	B
well usually a bunch of different places	3768	B
right see as much as you can while you're there	3768	B
yeah how did you like Africa	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
what type of work	3768	B
oh okay	3768	B
oh uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
yeah	3768	B
that's neat	3768	B
i've i've always um i've talked to people who've been to Africa and they	3768	B
and then of course when that movie Out of Africa came out um but i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there	3768	B
uh-huh	3768	B
oh how neat	3768	B
yeah that's great	3768	B
um	3768	B
all right	3709	B
um exercise huh	3709	B
um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings i belong to Presidents and uh i've got a routine for every morning of the week and i don't work out on Saturday or Sunday	3709	B
but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training	3709	B
no i i actually i just you know joined on my own and i've been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives	3709	B
but i pretty much uh worked on my own routine	3709	B
they've got the track on the inside and uh i run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i run two miles	3709	B
and then after that i work out with weights	3709	B
uh and i work out with free weights	3709	B
oh uh yeah it's really uh aerobic work out part	3709	B
uh about seven minutes	3709	B
uh no i do yeah that's that's a pretty good pretty good clip and i'll be i'm pretty winded by the time i get done	3709	B
so	3709	B
oh yeah i- i could i could probably go faster but then i'd wear myself out and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else	3709	B
yeah how about_1 you	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
oh i see	3709	B
so just uh just try and keep them_1 uh i guess uh firm and	3709	B
yeah yeah that's true	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
hm	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
oh i see	3709	B
i see	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
oh i see uh so you're in uh in part of a band	3709	B
oh i see i see i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school but it wasn't the trumpet so i was just wondering if that's what it was or something	3709	B
i see	3709	B
so you you have any plans of maybe running- running more when the weather gets nicer	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
um-hum yeah i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh a while back i was more into basketball and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves	3709	B
and uh but it's been a while since i've done that	3709	B
i see	3709	B
right right	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah i- i that's true i've noticed that uh	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
uh-huh	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah huh that's that's interesting though i you know i've been thinking of changing i've done the same routine for almost two years now and i'm thinking it of changing it up	3709	B
uh that's why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine	3709	B
because_1 i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing	3709	B
so i'm looking at changing things a little bit	3709	B
um-hum	3709	B
yeah	3709	B
yeah huh	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
they set that up for you	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
and uh what kind of running do you do	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
is it just aerobic or	3709	A
no i mean the running	3709	A
you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less	3709	A
uh-huh and then you wouldn't then you don't get um out of breath	3709	A
oh	3709	A
oh	3709	A
but i mean he's just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
right yeah	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
yeah i- i don't run much any more i did when i was in school i right now i just lift um	3709	A
weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and that's about it	3709	A
and i don't i don't lift any heavy weights uh they're about_1 a third of my body weight	3709	A
yeah and um um i play the trumpet and uh the more	3709	A
upper body strength the easier it is to play you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh	3709	A
and then i- i hurt my neck uh about_1 three years ago so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from	3709	A
um hurting yourself when you play high	3709	A
you have to you have to do it correctly it's you know it's like an exercise in itself but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it	3709	A
um i play at church	3709	A
and	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah	3709	A
well yeah	3709	A
well yeah well the weather's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in Dallas yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesn't that doesn't get it done i- i- i mostly jump rope more you know	3709	A
uh-huh	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah i- i do a toe lift and squats for that but you know i it it doesn't um	3709	A
it doesn't um	3709	A
accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you're running for a long time they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time	3709	A
and it also builds too much mass if you just you know	3709	A
so and it's like i- i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with	3709	A
and um then it doesn't bother me very much	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
right	3709	A
um-hum	3709	A
yeah that's i- i started doing more push ups and it it's helped a lot and then i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out i don't try to push it to the end in one set	3709	A
