when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
yeah i was i was making more than i was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired	3104	B
yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really	3104	B
there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there	3104	B
i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit um	3104	B
my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known	3104	B
how not i'm not going to say easy but how	3104	B
much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh	3104	B
scholarship to go anyplace else i think that i	3104	B
would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was	3104	B
taken out of my element you know the the the homogeneous Midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh	3104	B
different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me	3104	B
now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could	3104	B
i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already uh but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to	3104	B
you know them getting an education they really need a a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and uh	3104	B
an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you	3104	B
it's very different	3104	B
you shouldn't	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
oh yeah	3104	B
uh-huh	3104	B
uh well let's see	3104	A
five	3104	A
well any number is nice let me tell you	3104	A
yeah it's not as fair to the children either i don't think	3104	A
oh	3104	A
yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
you can tell	3104	A
how to just entertain themselves	3104	A
yeah yeah	3104	A
it's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being	3104	A
uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference	3104	A
uh keeps you busy	3104	A
yeah	3104	A
well that's great	3104	A
no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and	3104	A
well we didn't do it right all the time with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh	3104	A
right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in uh and take what they're interested in and then then start looking for schools	3104	A
no not necessarily	3104	A
and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Reynolds- Riddle and we talked him into going local here first	3104	A
and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that	3104	A
uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally	3104	A
and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines	3104	A
uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didn't want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess	3104	A
uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion	3104	A
because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted	3104	A
and our other uh two boys they went to Clarion also and uh did very well there	3104	A
and they've all really got uh	3104	A
they've all really got really good jobs	3104	A
and uh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college	3104	A
she said i- i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody	3104	A
but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life	3104	A
because if they get an education	3104	A
and are willing to go where the jobs are	3104	A
they can make a you know a much better income	3104	A
like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state	3104	A
you know that boggles my mind	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
okay did you go to college	3104	A
you did see it it makes a difference	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
uh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
someplace else	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
that's great	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
different life styles yes yeah	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
uh-huh	3104	A
right	3104	A
it's quite a bit different	3104	A
see that's the way we are we're more of a rural type of a area	3104	A
and it does make a difference	3104	A
i they say you shouldn't look at the expense of the college when you are looking	3104	A
yeah not really because they say a lot of times you -can get more help	3104	A
with a more expensive college	3104	A
and so in the long run if it's really what they want	3104	A
you know they're better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school uh we we did all we could	3104	A
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go	3104	A
okay we're on	3114	A
so uh you're you're for no restrictions or	3114	A
uh-huh	3114	A
yeah	3114	A
right	3114	A
i what kind- what what kind of means would those be	3114	A
uh-huh in other words you're saying that it would be hard uh to get rid of all of the guns	3114	A
well doesn't it doesn't doesn't London have a ban on firearms	3114	A
England	3114	A
yeah don't they carry don't their policemen over there carry these billy clubs	3114	A
yeah	3114	A
well it would be nice uh uh to be able to take your family out uh especially when they're dependent on you and not worry about uh having to have a gun just to protect yourself and them	3114	A
well i have a couple of guns and uh one i always worry about somebody getting ahold of it that that you know won't know how to handle it	3114	A
and uh probably never will do me any good because_1 the bullets in one place and the firearm's in another	3114	A
and i carry one in the pickup uh and i worry about it being stolen and uh of course i'm like you i don't like to kill things	3114	A
so	3114	A
oh yeah and and there's a lot-	3114	A
the crazies are out there in numbers	3114	A
well you know i would love to see a ban uh on firearms and i'd have to rate myself as a number one however i worry that that the that the country could ever get to that point	3114	A
and then i worry about uh the fact that uh what if there was some sort of insurrection in this country- in this country	3114	A
then uh how would we as citizens uh band together and ever put down an uprising if there were no firearms	3114	A
i don't think we ever will	3114	A
yeah so somewhere- somewhere along the line then uh you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh oh what's the organization that uh	3114	A
that the rifle association	3114	A
the gun- the uh the gun association is is heavily for no bans whatsoever	3114	A
yeah well i think so too so i'd have to vote for uh uh maybe a five in uh and hopefully uh we could put some sort of restriction on the handling of firearms	3114	A
like like you suggested	3114	A
okay Betty well sounds good enough to me then	3114	A
well same here and uh one of these days that name's gonna come back to me	3114	A
okay sweetheart bye-bye	3114	A
okay well i just on on gun control i just always felt like that i think	3114	B
i don't think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that person out um	3114	B
i don't believe that most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe it's probably	3114	B
bought across the market and i don't think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all	3114	B
uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say	3114	B
if a criminal- if a criminal should go happen to go into a gun store i don't think it would hurt anybody to wait a week	3114	B
to go back and pick up that gun so that they can check them out	3114	B
and if it is somebody like that then no but i really think that most of the criminals in our city who have guns do not go into a gun store and buy them i think they get them_1 from other means	3114	B
oh i don't know like from each other you know uh	3114	B
i think so	3114	B
jeez now i don't know	3114	B
that's right nobody over there carries guns	3114	B
i don't know if we could get away with guns completely i guess	3114	B
that's right i agree with that i agree with that i we do not own one um	3114	B
and i don't intend to buy one and i'm not a hunter i guess those people feel a little bit different but i don't believe in hunting either so you know	3114	B
right	3114	B
uh-huh	3114	B
no i don't either well it is terrible when you have to ride down the street and think somebody could just shoot at you for nothing which has been in the news a lot lately you know no apparent reason	3114	B
right right	3114	B
hm	3114	B
yeah	3114	B
uprising	3114	B
you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms	3114	B
i don't either that's the problem not in this country	3114	B
right	3114	B
oh yes	3114	B
yeah well i think we ought to have some	3114	B
right i could go for that	3114	B
yeah i think that would i think that's the only way	3114	B
well	3114	B
i've enjoyed talking to you	3114	B
oh me- me too okay bye-bye	3114	B
right right	3183	A
i have been well i go quite a bit i travel about_1 forty percent of my time but my vacations my favorite spot is Las Vegas yeah	3183	A
really i are there any particular reason you're not into gambling or	3183	A
i see	3183	A
oh really in France	3183	A
yes	3183	A
uh-huh	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
no uh my in-laws have and i i stay- stay steer away from boats as much as possible only because i can't take it	3183	A
really	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
right right exactly	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
i yes everything i see that they brought back it i- i definitely agree	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
really	3183	A
oh yes yes	3183	A
i it's it cruises from what i understand are are really the way to go and someday- someday i will convince my or convince myself that i can handle it and i will surprise my wife and and book a cruise uh i	3183	A
much definitely prefer warmer climates than Alaska so i would probably head for the Caribbean	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
i've used those right	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
interesting interesting- i never i really never thought of that that's pretty good to know	3183	A
um-hum yeah	3183	A
yeah and this is one spot you know being in Ohio the New England states are not that far uh that is one thing that really has not interested us we do like the Virginias the Carolinas Carolina	3183	A
oh yes several times	3183	A
yeah and uh we next week we're leaving for New Orleans and i'm i i do prefer the warmer the warmer	3183	A
um-hum but uh and i loved Hawaii	3183	A
uh we had bought	3183	A
really it it's it's uh it's just beautiful i just	3183	A
i would be very happy staying in Hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isn't too far off which is something i might wanna consider but uh	3183	A
i you know i've i've been tempted i've gotten down as far as San Antonio but i've never gone down to uh really to the coastline	3183	A
yeah so	3183	A
uh-huh	3183	A
i love it yes i that	3183	A
um-hum	3183	A
yes it is and you have to do that uh people that go and they only go to one area you have to see it all	3183	A
yes very good well it's nice talking to you okay um-hum bye-bye	3183	A
well we're gonna be talking about vacations i guess huh where have you been recently	3183	B
Las Vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting man- i've been there one time and i'll be honest i did not enjoy it no no	3183	B
i- i guess just because i'm not that type of a person i'm i'm a CPA and i i'm very conservative with my money and i just did to me that was not a vacation	3183	B
uh i now i'm a big world traveler i enjoy traveling the world i just got back from Hawaii uh this past July uh the prior year before that i'd been to uh Tokyo Disneyland	3183	B
uh i've been i've got a trip coming up next year i'm going to the EuroDisney	3183	B
uh that's gonna be in Paris France we're going there in July	3183	B
and at the same time we're also gonna go visit Norway i've always wanted to go see the Fjords of Norway i just love have- have- have you ever been on a cruise to um Alaska	3183	B
okay	3183	B
well i tell you what if i possibly can uh there's a spot that i would love to encourage you to go visit	3183	B
my father same way	3183	B
he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i don't like it	3183	B
the thing that is so wonderful about the Alaskan cruise it is on what they call the inside passage	3183	B
you're not in the ocean you are in a river almost	3183	B
only- only the only thing you have are cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right side and we're talking about five hundred foot thousand foot cliffs	3183	B
absolutely gorgeous and-	3183	B
and- and- and- and every yeah and every thirty yards here comes another uh waterfall which is nothing more than the melting snow	3183	B
that's just more glorious than the last one it is absolutely fantastic and with those cliffs the sunsets are just oh my goodness uh	3183	B
for me and my wife it was probably the most romantic one week trip i have ever ever taken	3183	B
and the food the food on we were on uh Princess Cruise Lines and the food was just out of this world	3183	B
well if that be the case-	3183	B
i was gonna say you can go to the Caribbean but the now the problem with the Caribbean though now you've got the ocean and i've been to the Caribbean three times now you got the ocean and if you have a motion sickness problem now they have these little patches you can put behind your ear	3183	B
uh you'd wanna use those but the same time though you- you're not going to get as pleasant of a ride as you would on that Alaskan cruise	3183	B
uh but and and and there there are parts especially when you get close to Cuba there are the water can get very very rough	3183	B
really can but uh otherwise as far as vacation i've i've course i see i guess i like the cold weather i i've been up to New England and i thought that was fantastic	3183	B
um	3183	B
now	3183	B
oh have you have you been on the Blue Ridge Parkway oh wow now that's fantastic	3183	B
see i'm a Louisiana boy so i know where you're talking about_1 there	3183	B
yes now that was my first trip i've ever been to Hawaii yes	3183	B
well stay away from the Texas coastlines Texas doesn't have anything for you	3183	B
yeah	3183	B
the the coastline yeah the coastline here is the pits uh there's- there's much better in Florida much much better uh other places Hawaii was wonderful that was great	3183	B
uh i thought Waikiki Beach was as nice of a of a beach as i ever wanna see and we went to four different islands we had a great time	3183	B
well tell you what i've got a i've got a phone ringing on the other line i better go answer it i've enjoyed talking to you though catch you later bye-bye	3183	B
well uh i agree that they have problems but i- i'm afraid i'm very much against universal health um my daughter is uh	3153	B
uh stationed in England right now and of course you know they've had uh group health uh over there for some time um	3153	B
i was over there last- uh a year ago when my granddaughter was born	3153	B
and uh she had some problems and uh i was horrified from beginning to end first of all they are about fifty years behind	3153	B
they don't have and their medical technology the doctors since they aren't responsible really to each patient don't feel they have to sit down and talk to you about the problems	3153	B
when they want to do something to a patient whether the patient is a few days old or eighty or ninety they do it they don't ask permission	3153	B
my daughter went um upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didn't even know they were going to do surgery on the baby uh	3153	B
yes it was it was really terrible that's why i went over there i mean she was she cried she called and was you know really you know upset um the day we were leaving the hospital finally	3153	B
um we were getting all ready to go home and finally you know the baby was okay and everything was fine and the doctor that had been working with her poked his head in the door and he said by the way he said in six weeks he want you to come back uh	3153	B
for a test- uh uh a test that we want to do on on her um for uh uh	3153	B
multiple sclerosis	3153	B
and he turned around and left	3153	B
and we just kind of looked at each other and said what	3153	B
uh for what and i i tried for fifteen minutes to find the doctor and he was unavailable	3153	B
well the the thing is these are the HMO's that they have now which are cheaper and you can in my daughter- my other daughter belongs to an HMO or they used to thankfully they've just changed um you don't	3153	B
you only get a choice of doctors that are in your area not necessarily of doctors that are good or not uh see i i've worked for i worked for Johns Hopkins for two years	3153	B
uh at the hospital there and i've worked for a private doctor for two years and um	3153	B
get him out of there she said well he hasn't done anything wrong it's just that he has poor judgment and i thought oh gosh i mean you're the doctor telling you this you know um	3153	B
some horror stories like that but then when with the HMO um the they sent her to a pediatrician that had one gentleman that was uh	3153	B
uh in his late seventies	3153	B
and an Indian doctor that she couldn't understand and that had no patience with children	3153	B
and you know it was kind of that was kind of a bad experience too so when they changed she finally got	3153	B
you know a good pediatrician but uh uh it it it's	3153	B
it's just a little scary when you don't have as much when you can't just go say hey here's a good doctor i'm going to go to this doctor you know um	3153	B
and i i fear that the doctors are going to not be as you know right now they're in a lot of fierce competition so they they keep up to date you know at least most of them the good ones	3153	B
um i- i i don't know i just fear that uh that it may go downhill if we do indeed you know change to something like that uh	3153	B
no it doesn't uh also	3153	B
uh we uh my husband was a civilian but we were uh stationed overseas for a while and so i had to go to	3153	B
myself and the children had to go do military doctors huh wow now that's another story you know so but it's the same	3153	B
same thing i mean these doctors didn't want to be here okay they were fulfilling their military obligations and you know they uh of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they uh	3153	B
well enjoy the field but um the- i have found	3153	B
uh through people that i know that have HMO's that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking	3153	B
i mean not speaking but like Indian doctors you can't understand them because of their their um uh accent	3153	B
uh or uh Chinese or and i have nothing against them in fact i went to a doctor for years that was a Chinese doctor but i could understand what he was saying	3153	B
you know so i just it just this is a bad subject for me to be on only because i've had some real bad experiences and i've known some people that have uh	3153	B
been	3153	B
right well i'll tell you now what you do	3153	B
is you go uh to the doctors and just meet them	3153	B
and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you give him	3153	B
i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um uh if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that uh	3153	B
is uh uh	3153	B
is usually pretty good but uh uh you know you- i'd try him out	3153	B
yeah oh it should- okay see that's it	3153	B
yeah so that's see that's what scares me about going into universal health	3153	B
okay i mean you could you could really be in serious trouble if you wait to see one of the ones that you feel are better if uh uh you know if we went to that and that was all there was	3153	B
um uh	3153	B
oh well they don't it would it would still be like it is now um the ones in your area	3153	B
you know and that would be closest to where you live uh and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume um	3153	B
but uh but also now in England how they work it is you go to see a regular MD	3153	B
if he determines that it's necessary then he'll send you to a gynecologist or a surgeon or you know you can't just go there	3153	B
uh	3153	B
yes	3153	B
um-hum	3153	B
yep	3153	B
um hum	3153	B
that's right and uh i mean you know that could potentially be um	3153	B
rather	3153	B
all right um how do you feel about the health insurance problems	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
wow	3153	A
oh my God what a terrible thing for her to go through	3153	A
ah	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
right	3153	A
right	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
oh	3153	A
ah	3153	A
right	3153	A
that doesn't give any incentive	3153	A
uh-huh	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
i guess so	3153	A
i just joined an HMO i just got a new job and i haven't heard i haven't been i haven't even actually paid for it or actually started my coverage yet but that's what they have is HMO and	3153	A
um-hum	3153	A
well what they told me at at work they told me that uh	3153	A
so	3153	A
yeah	3153	A
how would they decide who get's which doctor	3153	A
oh i see local	3153	A
right that the same for the HMO and and because the doctors work for the HMO the people i work with are telling me you know HMO's are great if you're generally healthy	3153	A
and you just go for the checkup every year or whatever it's just three dollars but if you have a problem then it's real hard to get the doctor to refer you to a specialist because they're told you know not to because_1 it cost the HMO money	3153	A
all right and and your occupation is teaching	3115	A
substitute teacher	3115	A
yes it is it is uh-huh	3115	A
right well i was just trying to make an introduction here	3115	A
but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now	3115	A
i've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron	3115	A
right i well not really i've got the every day i've got to uh read to kindergartners so i'm going to be down on the floor with them i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day	3115	A
for uh you know a half hour so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do	3115	A
because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses	3115	A
right	3115	A
well of course you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold	3115	A
but you don't know uh	3115	A
i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there	3115	A
subtract right	3115	A
i i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools that's one of things one of the things i ask about	3115	A
you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing	3115	A
and and i said well you know that was okay and i'm basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in the winter you know i just add a	3115	A
maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer	3115	A
that's about	3115	A
i don't i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and	3115	A
you know look really	3115	A
yeah	3115	A
right right	3115	A
and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you	3115	A
right right	3115	A
right on what Thursday- Thursday	3115	A
right right so that would kind of give you	3115	A
a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time	3115	A
of what's going on that so that's	3115	A
and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they gonna put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties	3115	A
and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh	3115	A
dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top and and uh	3115	A
i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they can- have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
right right right	3115	A
yeah there- there's a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others right	3115	A
right	3115	A
well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there	3115	A
there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if uh that teaches health or	3115	A
English- you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie i some of those male coaches that might really	3115	A
right and a T-shirt	3115	A
right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so	3115	A
whether	3115	A
change then well see that's what i would think	3115	A
that's what i would think	3115	A
right	3115	A
course we had had one coach one period he'd teach PE and the next period Health and then a period of PE and and that's hard you know so he just left warm-ups on but	3115	A
but uh no i think really probably they could they could uh	3115	A
really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and	3115	A
you don't think so	3115	A
well some of them yes they do and and it's not at some of the private schools but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that	3115	A
uh-huh	3115	A
well i i think it would make a difference at school i i don't think we should be spending time	3115	A
saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts- too shorts too short or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know i mean	3115	A
it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we can't to that either i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear	3115	A
a button down shirt you know that would that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks	3115	A
and they could buy them anywhere they wanted and you know and	3115	A
and then the girls could	3115	A
right i don't no not in Plano	3115	A
they may get away- but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there	3115	A
Highland Park's thinking about going that route	3115	A
so it	3115	A
and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do	3115	A
yeah i agree with you on	3115	A
i'm a substitute- i'm a substitute teacher is is this Pat i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in	3115	B
oh okay	3115	B
oh	3115	B
well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that	3115	B
well	3115	B
what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater	3115	B
yes	3115	B
you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off	3115	B
and it's it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual	3115	B
uh	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
right and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week	3115	B
and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some	3115	B
sort of hat	3115	B
no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many schools on a particular day during uh	3115	B
i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which	3115	B
right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools	3115	B
yeah	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think	3115	B
but it i think it varies it it just so much anything anything can go	3115	B
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they're all pretty fancy	3115	B
but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other departments that aren't and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might	3115	B
might say	3115	B
right	3115	B
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them	3115	B
or you're going to be observed	3115	B
yeah	3115	B
right they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants	3115	B
yeah well at Vines the coaches don't do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
but they they don't look you know they don't wear their sweat pants or or anything they're they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in PE	3115	B
those i can understand yeah	3115	B
i don't think we'll ever get to that uh no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times- they've had uniforms for years i really- don't really know if they still do	3115	B
it certainly makes it easier to dress	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
yeah but i doubt that that would come about- that that will come about just i yeah i i i	3115	B
no not yeah	3115	B
well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete	3115	B
uh-huh	3115	B
yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but	3115	B
yeah	3129	A
exactly	3129	A
oh	3129	A
did- did- did you do the diagnosis or- or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
yeah i know uh when working with the uh flashers	3129	A
there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam	3129	A
diagram	3129	A
yeah i don't even know if my uh current cars have a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are uh	3129	A
things running uh while they're at the same unit like the little- the headlamp	3129	A
you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam uh requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse	3129	A
so that's a possibility	3129	A
is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for uh old imports	3129	A
who-	3129	A
um so it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that	3129	A
yeah have you found any uh uh reliable import service people in the metroplex	3129	A
oh yeah	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
i'll be darned	3129	A
uh-huh	3129	A
oh my goodness	3129	A
oh no	3129	A
well ours wasn't within the last year i guess it's been within the last two years uh	3129	A
Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new and it's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh	3129	A
i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort	3129	A
and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems it was	3129	A
idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that uh we park on a on a hill under our car port and	3129	A
when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you	3129	A
and the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit	3129	A
so we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place	3129	A
and asked them to check it out and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again	3129	A
i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around but the	3129	A
second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their uh service reports from region or headquarters whatever and	3129	A
and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part	3129	A
and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine	3129	A
for a a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don't- we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven	3129	A
well Tom just tonight i was working on my car out of necessity and i had uh	3129	B
uh had a long age old problem of my bright lights not working uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column	3129	B
and when i would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely	3129	B
which is even worse than them just not getting bright	3129	B
and i had to presume that it was the switch and uh this is uh an older car it's a seventy two MG	3129	B
so i had to mail order the part uh which i had done and tonight i went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch	3129	B
so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh and hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used	3129	B
uh i had	3129	B
done what diagnosis i could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car	3129	B
and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem i talked to one mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also	3129	B
uh but i've not you know i really don't know what the problem might be it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard	3129	B
uh it might be tied into the equation somehow	3129	B
but uh	3129	B
i i don't know i should look at that i don't remember seeing one in the uh	3129	B
in the the diagram but i'll have to go back and look at that	3129	B
uh-huh	3129	B
yeah that's a good idea	3129	B
what i've typically found when that uh companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all and i hope that that's the case this time	3129	B
right exactly it's out of uh Kansas	3129	B
somewhere	3129	B
no it's not i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car but uh it is not either it's uh obviously doesn't quite fit	3129	B
so it must be for a different year	3129	B
so i'll have to try to return that as well	3129	B
well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car because i've owned this car since it was new	3129	B
and uh but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area	3129	B
and i hadn't used him for some years and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of uh all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh German cars and	3129	B
German cars i'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on British cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it	3129	B
so uh uh i may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work so i'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out	3129	B
i've not had to- to exchange any other parts recently uh	3129	B
because they were defective now i've had had pretty good luck i just however did uh have to get a	3129	B
a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players	3129	B
uh repaired i'd purchased it at at Sam's and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty and i should have checked more carefully and and done a better job of saving the receipt	3129	B
because uh i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by uh some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play	3129	B
and as it turned out it had a full year's warranty and i could have gotten it repaired for free but i i had to to take it in while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost	3129	B
uh but it didn't do me any good because i had i had missed the window by about a week or two so i didn't even i didn't really uh even bring it up when i went in to pick it up	3129	B
but uh that's really my only experience in the past year where i've had to take a product back because of a defect	3129	B
good grief	3129	B
uh-huh	3129	B
huh	3129	B
my goodness	3129	B
huh	3129	B
yeah	3144	B
well uh it's funny when i tried to make the call the other days i thought i hadn't seen anything since Dances With Wolves but today i went to see Regarding With Henry	3144	B
it was really good we uh Jeff Warner just got out of the hospital and uh Jeff and Deanna went and	3144	B
another friend in the neighborhood and uh we all liked it we had uh both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and everyone enjoyed it and uh	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston uh	3144	B
and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought well i want to see this one too so we uh i finally it's my first summer movie	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
oh was that good	3144	B
uh well i want to see that and City Slickers both i love comedies but that's what i was	3144	B
oh was it	3144	B
oh	3144	B
oh well good i'm i'm glad to hear that because they	3144	B
uh-huh	3144	B
well i don't i don't know if you got to see Weekend um At Bernie's that was out a couple of year's ago they had a free showing at the Berkeley um United Artist	3144	B
and i don't know who was here or whether Jay just called a friend and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we'd try it you know free movie	3144	B
it was so funny and it sounds like uh what you were just describing Soapdish too i mean we just we hurt by the time we came out and the whole theater was hysterical and it's just it's just goofy i mean it's	3144	B
uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on TV i would think	3144	B
um because_1 it's it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way Soapdish was but with everyone laughing	3144	B
well i'm glad you did that before your surgery	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
oh gosh	3144	B
oh	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
yeah yeah	3144	B
yeah	3144	B
no that was one uh Jay got to see with a friend and so i i- and to try and uh	3144	B
try and find time it's hard uh	3144	B
with Jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go and	3144	B
um i'm holding out for City Slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group and because i think he he needs a comedy too um	3144	B
uh and that's what he would have liked to have seen Regarding Henry too but knew that	3144	B
uh we've we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful we're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing uh	3144	B
there's just not a time enough time to do it all and he said well realistically you know he knew he couldn't get them all in but uh Jay really liked Robin Hood um	3144	B
when the choir group went to see Backdraft and they thought that was uh	3144	B
it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know aren't real big but the the fire scenes and the drafts- you know that action part is fantastic	3144	B
but he thought Robin Hood was great it was real different then you'd expect but he- but he enjoyed it and so	3144	B
yeah me too and yeah i really uh like him a lot which is why Dances With Wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months but it was i uh	3144	B
in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again because_1 we really wanted him to see it too	3144	B
uh	3144	B
i just thought that was terrific and i really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see	3144	B
and he's very good in Regarding Henry that's not an easy part to play i i don't think	3144	B
yeah that's at that one won't hurt your sides um it was this the first time you got to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians	3144	B
uh-huh	3144	B
you ready okay what have you seen lately	3144	A
oh i'm dying to see that	3144	A
oh	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
oh my goodness	3144	A
oh well i am just dying to see it i went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a babysitter and we'll all go see Regarding Henry and i said ooh i want to see it so bad	3144	A
oh	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
oh my well let me see was it well we went to see One Hundred And One Dalmatians last weekend and that may be	3144	A
no right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on we're going to the movies and we won't well she goes all the time but i go maybe once every couple of months	3144	A
and when i go i go see two at a time so we went to see Soapdish	3144	A
and oh hysterical we laughed so hard it was just you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard	3144	A
yeah that's the other one that we went to see that night	3144	A
and my face hurt so bad from laughing because i love Billy Crystal and course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff	3144	A
so much of that was so true and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles it was so funny both of them were great	3144	A
oh they are are we just laughed so hard and like i said with City Slick i mean with Soapdish it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know just they just carried it off to the tee it was	3144	A
no	3144	A
how neat	3144	A
shoot yeah	3144	A
oh yeah	3144	A
yeah i think it is i think it is	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
oh gosh i never laughed and people were just screaming and applauding and you know it was just hysterical	3144	A
oh me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now i mean i'm getting around real good and i'm just still real sore and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after	3144	A
uh but see i don't have permanent work i right now i'm working with a temporary agency	3144	A
and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers because_1 you can learn all the software for free	3144	A
and so i went up to do WordPerfect because_1 that seems like that's what everybody wants	3144	A
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day and i said yeah and i went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that	3144	A
and uh i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week and	3144	A
so i went to my doctor's last Thursday and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh you're just healing really well i just can't get over this he says	3144	A
in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things if you want to play ball you can go play ball he says now i'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to and uh you know he was teasing me and	3144	A
he says yeah you'll be out there waterskiing i can just see it now	3144	A
and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks i said okay fine i i will i will whatever you call easy i'll do it you know	3144	A
but and i've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it	3144	A
and so i don't i'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when i was when i'm still sort of on the sore side	3144	A
but well what- what's your next have you seen Robin Hood yet	3144	A
uh	3144	A
oh yeah	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
yeah	3144	A
uh-huh	3144	A
oh really	3144	A
well i went course i am a Kevin Costner fan supreme	3144	A
uh-huh gosh was that wonderful	3144	A
oh yeah	3144	A
i do too i think he's really good	3144	A
i wouldn't think well my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night so i sort of think i may go do that	3144	A
good	3144	A
i have- my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age and we went to the	3144	A
does tend to get talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how they're collected	3177	A
is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does	3177	A
enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are	3177	A
uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and	3177	A
well i think	3177	A
i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right	3177	A
i	3177	A
no not uh not near to the extent that it was	3177	A
right	3177	A
right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good incentive- good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of	3177	A
uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way	3177	A
people	3177	A
well	3177	A
right but couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there	3177	A
and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make	3177	A
and then some	3177	A
so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing	3177	A
uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year you'd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing	3177	A
doing away with everything except for yeah all forms- all forms of it including	3177	A
well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent	3177	A
yeah so if you took the money out of one	3177	A
well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage	3177	A
if if	3177	A
well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money	3177	A
you know pays taxes or not but he's going to have to pay that percentage see what i'm saying	3177	A
well when a guy comes in to you know he's got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries	3177	A
he pays fifteen percent tax let's say	3177	A
and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax	3177	A
so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it	3177	A
and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased	3177	A
because_1 the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him	3177	A
whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong	3177	A
see so i'm saying there's	3177	A
right right	3177	A
so you you tax	3177	A
yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it	3177	A
yeah it it does seem	3177	A
it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they	3177	A
they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them_1 anymore	3177	A
so	3177	A
that's true that's true not being an economy major i guess they'd never ask me anyway	3177	A
oh	3177	A
right	3177	A
but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments	3177	B
but we don't have that anymore do we	3177	B
i didn't think so they've even cut you know who can have an IRA	3177	B
that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now they've cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair	3177	B
but they already tax us i mean where we live it's eight almost eight and a half percent tax	3177	B
oh and then some and then some	3177	B
are you talking about doing away with income tax	3177	B
i don't think	3177	B
well we're already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i don't think that would generate enough money	3177	B
oh i see what you're saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um	3177	B
off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period	3177	B
well if they're not reporting the income now they're still not paying it so what's the point	3177	B
no	3177	B
um-hum	3177	B
right	3177	B
right	3177	B
right	3177	B
oh i see what you're saying but if we had to have an income tax which they're never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay	3177	B
what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPA's and	3177	B
H&R Blocks would be out of of a job but uh	3177	B
yeah	3177	B
i never have understood why they don't do that	3177	B
no no	3177	B
i don't know i- i guess there's never a an answer nobody ever asks	3177	B
they don't ask me at all	3177	B
i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because_1 some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they don't pay anything	3177	B
and i question their i- i- i just think that they've made it almost a joke	3177	B
all the deductions in the the way you can send-	3177	B
okay um	3148	B
in Plano	3148	B
yes where do you live	3148	B
oh okay	3148	B
huh	3148	B
um i was trying to think uh something we were watching the other day and they were doing	3148	B
an overview of Los Angeles uh from an area that was up higher and you literally could see the band of smog that uh i've never been out there but	3148	B
it was it was quite evident that	3148	B
it was a real brown area and	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
yes well i know uh that's been the concern in Europe they hadn't uh we have friends in Germany and uh	3148	B
have family that live near the Black Forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we	3148	B
switched- uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars	3148	B
uh that's something that Europe didn't do right away and now they're doing that and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found	3148	B
that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there it's not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of	3148	B
um i guess from from something that the car was	3148	B
um	3148	B
was giving	3148	B
yes and	3148	B
yes yeah	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yeah i i get that sometimes um my line gets some static i don't know why	3148	B
well and i would think in our um we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and uh oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal	3148	B
oh i don't know what to usually it's the other phone i have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me	3148	B
okay	3148	B
i don't know what uh	3148	B
i i don't know what the problem is but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that uh	3148	B
there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days and and it yes it can be used and it can help but uh that was a problem that they were still	3148	B
working on but	3148	B
what-	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yes	3148	B
uh i hope so	3148	B
well i do think um i mean you've already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there's a problem and more people are interested in uh	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yes well and and for the future generations too uh	3148	B
yes	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
yeah	3148	B
where do you live	3148	A
in Plano	3148	A
in Dallas	3148	A
uh the air pollution isn't too bad in our area so we're very fortunate but	3148	A
i know in some areas it's really it it really is bad	3148	A
i haven't either	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad particularly in the areas where there are industries uh	3148	A
where they are burning a lot of coal and oil up more up north i guess uh i think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution antipollution devices i think the	3148	A
air isn't as bad as it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area	3148	A
from acid rain	3148	A
i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid	3148	A
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time i think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots	3148	A
as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad	3148	A
what's interesting several years ago i took a course	3148	A
uh on uh well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and	3148	A
how much pollution there was and there wasn't from various kinds of of energy and uh	3148	A
at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh-poohed you know oh you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing	3148	A
and it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage	3148	A
so it's kind of interesting the change in	3148	A
perspective	3148	A
from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear uh i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use	3148	A
is not bomb quality and we're so strict with all our controls in the United States the chances of of an accident are slight and it doesn't pollute the air at all it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant	3148	A
many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants it's kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear	3148	A
so i don't know in Europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become uh bomb quality	3148	A
but that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there's some problem uh pollute the groundwater	3148	A
so i don't know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or uh fusion or something clean well we've got a problem on the line don't we	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
but uh	3148	A
solar of course would be the clean cleanest	3148	A
i can't hear you at all for all this static	3148	A
now i can again	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
oh yeah it it's still got a long way to go	3148	A
it's just you know a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways it may not in all ways maybe they'll come up with fusion	3148	A
you know control- be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but	3148	A
one of these days because that's perfectly clean	3148	A
it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isn't not at all and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so that's not going to work	3148	A
at least not now but uh	3148	A
who knows what the future will hold	3148	A
uh as far as energy goes i i think	3148	A
with solving some of the energy future energy problems we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well	3148	A
i do to	3148	A
i like to be optimistic i don't like to be pessimistic about these things	3148	A
we have one earth to live on and we got to take care of it	3148	A
uh-huh	3148	A
i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth	3148	A
and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems	3148	A
i'm afraid	3148	A
i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't so many of them didn't people didn't care you know it's whatever	3148	A
you know recycle well if it's a problem forget that uh not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away	3148	A
how horrible you know now i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes uh and create-	3148	A
um my name's yeah i'm from uh New York where you from	3165	A
uh Brad LeMeaux	3165	A
Nola in Texas i i talked to someone from Texas yesterday where in Texas you say	3165	A
okay you have pets	3165	A
do you have pets	3165	A
yeah that's what the topic's supposed to be	3165	A
i got my New York accent	3165	A
yes	3165	A
that's pretty easy	3165	A
what the	3165	A
what type were they like sicklets and stuff like that	3165	A
i don't know if the	3165	A
i i had fish that were like they were called sicklets a type of family this is when i was a kid they they had um	3165	A
what are they called like oscars and uh i forgot the different names that they had but they would eat eat they would actually- they ate when they got big enough they would eat goldfish we would buy goldfish and feed them to them_1	3165	A
yeah i i agree with that i- i- i um	3165	A
and what did they do they they just took them_1 back	3165	A
yeah	3165	A
really yeah that's	3165	A
yeah that's what my friend used to do with his other fish he used to sell them_1 back to the store they'd buy them but uh that's cool that's	3165	A
that's easier	3165	A
do you do you still you still have guppies	3165	A
so you you stayed with the guppies	3165	A
great great yeah the- fish are fun	3165	A
no i- i used to have fish when i was a kid	3165	A
but i don't have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my parent's house i uh gave my fish to my friends and fish tank i think i gave to someone else	3165	A
um but i thought a few years ago- go and get one but i've moved around so much recently	3165	A
yeah they're not that easy but although it like living in New York City there's definitely no other pet that you would want i mean people- some people a lot of people have cats some people have dogs i mean i've i've even seen big big dogs in small apartments and i don't really see that	3165	A
yeah someday if i move out into the country i like it like a you know like a Labrador or something like that some you know bigger dog that could kind of run around outside and stuff	3165	A
but yeah you see these big dog- i mean i see this guy in my building with some i think it's like a golden retriever or something like that and he he's good though he takes him out all the time or her out all the time	3165	A
yeah this guy he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog so he probably gets in enough exercise	3165	A
but you know lot	3165	A
i'm doing fine	3165	B
what's what was your name	3165	B
oh i'm Nola and i'm in Plano Texas	3165	B
it's Plano it's just north of Dallas	3165	B
uh oh pets yes	3165	B
yeah i didn't quite understand what you said i'm sorry	3165	B
we don't have uh i grew up in New Jersey but it's been a long time since i lived there	3165	B
did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish that's it	3165	B
yeah it's uh	3165	B
uh uh neither my husband or i really wanted to take care of cats or dogs or anything like that so	3165	B
and the girls kind of wanted something we have four- uh well now we have four girls when we got the fish to start with we had two or three but um	3165	B
for some reason i just decided to start a fish tank and set up a ten gallon fish tank and	3165	B
it started with the some uh we had a real hard time getting it established tried the goldfish and they were just filthy could not keep the tank clean um	3165	B
eventually i took them back to the store and started- started all over again and	3165	B
i had another couple of kinds that ate each other so that bunch didn't work either	3165	B
um there were some neons and a couple of other kind i can't remember what they were	3165	B
but but they didn't get along very well whatever they were	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
huh	3165	B
well these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that but they were	3165	B
and uh they- i could see them_1 picking on each other	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
yeah anyway i finally got rid of those- those all killed each other off and i cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again and so- established and i got about half a dozen guppies from a friend	3165	B
and they just bred and bred and bred and they're uh there must've been a hundred guppies in that tank and i had- i took- i must've taken thirty or forty of them at a time back to the store two or three different times	3165	B
they took them_1 back and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time	3165	B
so yeah helped to buy fish food and filters	3165	B
uh-huh	3165	B
but- but- but uh then i i- i- i went for a while where um while i was pregnant with our new little baby we uh i- i just	3165	B
kept forgetting to clean the fish- tank and it was really dirty for a long time but those fish still lived in there and um	3165	B
finally i cleaned the tank out and most of them had disappeared um and i don't think i've got any males in there anymore so they're not multiplying anymore	3165	B
yeah yeah i need to get a new um	3165	B
algae eater though	3165	B
yep there's still there's about a dozen guppies in there right now	3165	B
so but that's the only thing we've got <b_aside> yes you may i know <e_aside> sorry and and so you have fish or do you have	3165	B
but you don't have anything right now	3165	B
yeah it's kind of a problem moving them	3165	B
you feel sorry for them	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
uh-huh	3165	B
you'd have to do it an awful lot though	3165	B
yeah	3165	B
um-hum	3116	A
yeah i- i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work	3116	A
so it's something that i end up kind of experimenting with with my girlfriends or maybe taking my girls out when he's gone and	3116	A
and so we end up usually finding something that's uh quick service and uh that's hopefully economical and uh	3116	A
certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre	3116	A
um as far as to really go out for an evening though i do like to have a place that's	3116	A
not real real formal but kind of on a formal side just because usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and it's real relaxing and then	3116	A
uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so	3116	A
um i guess my favorite kind of foods- foods would be uh the ones that	3116	A
well i don't know favorite is just going out for a good good hearty steak but	3116	A
i- i- i find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak houses it doesn't seem and i- i find that amazing being in Texas i'm from another state originally and	3116	A
i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state	3116	A
and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so	3116	A
oh really	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
huh	3116	A
huh	3116	A
yeah it's kind of an interesting approach	3116	A
so	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
yeah yeah	3116	A
um-hum um-hum	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah that's what we have too yeah and yeah you do have to kind of decide well are we there to get a good meal and and just	3116	A
be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesn't work with kids	3116	A
so what would make you go back to a good restaurant	3116	A
um-hum	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
and do you find that when you have children that it's it really makes uh you can really tell the difference between a good and a mediocre restaurant by the way they treat you with kids	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
um-hum	3116	A
oh yeah	3116	A
yeah we have a restaurant over here called Gershwin's that has a piano player always during your mealtime and it	3116	A
it just makes for a real classy feel and uh it kind of carries over the conversations next to you so you're not concentrating what someone else is saying next to you but i mean but you know at the next table but	3116	A
just within your own little group so it makes for a nice nice place to go	3116	A
oh yeah	3116	A
uh-huh	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
yeah	3116	A
well sounds good	3116	A
no i think we covered everything	3116	A
well thank you for being home okay bye-bye	3116	A
okay talk about uh what kind of restaurants we we like to go to and what uh makes us go back and i'll start talking about it so	3116	B
usually i just kind of like uh places that are family style kind of things because_1 it's a a casual atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff and and uh	3116	B
but we were in California recently and i went we went to a couple of very uh i guess expensive extravagant restaurants because_1 it was kind of the thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like	3116	B
and we got to get some real good food more exotic and uh we thought that the service was very good	3116	B
and uh that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even though it is expensive you know like maybe once a year or once every six months go to it or something like that	3116	B
but how about you	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
um-hum	3116	B
um-hum	3116	B
um-hum you know what we have around here too is uh a place where you uh you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself	3116	B
yeah and they they have everything else cooked you know but baked potatoes and all that but you you pick your meat and you know whether it's marinated or or just regular	3116	B
and uh then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself you know and then have all the stuff to put on it you know like if you want to	3116	B
i don't know butter on it or whatever or garlic and stuff like that	3116	B
you can you can do it that's kind of interesting it was really good	3116	B
yeah we we thought that was that wasn't too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these	3116	B
fancier restaurants and and i thought uh i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because_1 you know you see all these things like you see all these chef's chef's shows and stuff like that	3116	B
and uh and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if that's any good you know it looks kind of small but actually it wasn't bad at all	3116	B
you know when they have like seafood dishes uh but it's just kind of kind of sparse with different things put in it that that really uh	3116	B
that really taste pretty good you didn't you wouldn't think it goes together you know	3116	B
but uh but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family family type of things you know	3116	B
because_1 it's uh it's easier to go with two kids two young kids now	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
right right	3116	B
yeah that's true	3116	B
well i think uh some of the things that i liked were uh	3116	B
uh well i would see the food and whether or not it tastes good uh the service if they're you know courteous or if they just kind of are hasty you know if they just get your order and go and you never see them_1 again or they coming talk- you know talk with you a little bit or something	3116	B
yes i have we have we have noticed that	3116	B
yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when they're oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know	3116	B
to occupy them_1 you can really tell	3116	B
the other thing i've liked too is uh now this isn't you don't have this at at family restaurants but uh is some type of a like a a pianist or something	3116	B
that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat	3116	B
uh-huh	3116	B
yeah	3116	B
there was two places that we went to one in San Francisco and one in uh in Monterey California	3116	B
and uh the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you could- had a great view you know of San Francisco and everything	3116	B
and uh and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because_1 it was overlooking the water too	3116	B
so that was that was a couple things that we liked	3116	B
but	3116	B
okay you have anything else to say	3116	B
okay well thanks a lot	3116	B
okay	3116	B
bye-bye	3116	B
so it	3187	B
well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we	3187	B
sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore he actually died a few months after that and so	3187	B
as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he	3187	B
it was either you- know a nursing	3187	B
home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days	3187	B
um well the	3187	B
see uh well we	3187	B
he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list	3187	B
right we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into	3187	B
or we no actually no it was even Mennonite related i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly	3187	B
the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in	3187	B
uh what do you think	3187	B
um-hum	3187	B
yeah	3187	B
yeah yeah that's important i'd say	3187	B
okay	3187	B
yeah	3187	B
right so that	3187	B
right and that becomes difficult then	3187	B
um-hum yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life	3187	B
but he was essentially too proud and too	3187	B
independent so that even though his heart was	3187	B
getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he	3187	B
lived in	3187	B
his own house as long as he could though he was living alone	3187	B
had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the uh top without a great deal of pain	3187	B
and this eventually	3187	B
things just went too far and he	3187	B
he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home	3187	B
right well that's	3187	B
yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to	3187	B
help decide what's the right thing	3187	B
and	3187	B
um-hum	3187	B
yep	3187	B
how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home	3187	A
uh-huh	3187	A
right	3187	A
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him	3187	A
oh my	3187	A
yeah so the convenience	3187	A
right	3187	A
my grandmother lived with us um until August um and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia	3187	A
and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away	3187	A
so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one	3187	A
that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so	3187	A
yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room	3187	A
so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but	3187	A
when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and i've got little children here who needed me here	3187	A
um she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day	3187	A
so	3187	A
she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
uh-huh	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
oh	3187	A
yeah	3187	A
yes	3187	A
well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them_1 make decisions it sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now	3187	A
so	3187	A
well we enjoyed having her here but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her	3187	A
and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so	3187	A
it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because_1 she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair	3187	A
so i think she'll adjust	3187	A
i'll let you go ahead and start yeah	3198	B
you know i think that's changed just in the last generation just in the last little while because i know my father-in-law doesn't do that much of that	3198	B
kind of stuff but my husband is wonderful	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah yeah there still some that aren't cooperating but	3198	B
they're not accepting that anymore yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah well i feel like um	3198	B
to an extent that is really important you know that that um it is important for women who need to work uh or are in a position that they want to	3198	B
that they can do that um but i also think it is important for them to be with the children	3198	B
i- i think there there are some things that women just	3198	B
are designed to do better than men and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women i don't think it should ever be totally equal	3198	B
you know that's not uh we're not made like that that's right	3198	B
hm	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that	3198	B
and for some it's not a problem but there's more and more it's difficult for a family to make a living on one	3198	B
income it can be done but you make sacrifices you know and and it's um	3198	B
yeah	3198	B
-okay	3198	A
did you want me to go ahead	3198	A
okay well one thing i- i- i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality	3198	A
uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did um	3198	A
it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids versus um the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which uh they did everything they went to work and they took care of the family so	3198	A
exactly	3198	A
exactly yeah	3198	A
yeah that's the way my husband is too i mean it it doesn't uh doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes it doesn't bother him- him at all to do the laundry versus uh men from	3198	A
way back there is that well if you did that you were henpecked or whatever but	3198	A
men are starting	3198	A
yeah those are very few i think those men don't last very long in relationships because they think women know what they want	3198	A
right exactly and it's it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then	3198	A
kind of realize hey there's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all so it's it's kind of a	3198	A
a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households and i think that's even gonna get better	3198	A
even you know even more so i think it's just gonna be where men will do as much cleaning as women do	3198	A
and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this it will be	3198	A
uh hopefully for my daughter who i instill into it doesn't matter if you wanna drive a truck honey or if it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse it doesn't matter if you want to be	3198	A
uh the President or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor it doesn't matter it's what you want to be so i have always instilled into her and i think	3198	A
mothers um are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey	3198	A
you don't have to stay with nursing you don't have to be a secretary you don't have to be you can be whatever you want to be and whether it be a welder a trucker or whatever	3198	A
as long as you uh go to school for it and get the education so	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
if they want to right	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
i do too you know there's a certain part of me	3198	A
uh-huh	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
well emotionally i think uh women do a little bit uh i- i think that's the gap is coming closer as um	3198	A
what i've learned in uh just just	3198	A
being out there it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings and they get together and they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didn't have with their fathers	3198	A
are expressing more emotions learning what emotions are it may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves um	3198	A
i- i know of some mothers that uh i guess i'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more um	3198	A
low keyed more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised you know to develop whatever skills that they have and some of the men are developing uh	3198	A
very good too so it may come down to where it's	3198	A
it's individual basis where everybody's treated as an individual and not by	3198	A
sex if you wanna stay home and take care of the kids honey that's fine i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that	3198	A
um-hum	3198	A
on one income um-hum	3198	A
yeah	3198	A
yeah that	3198	A
kind of like what uh my husband and myself are doing right now my daughter's three even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with she's an only child i don't know if you've only got one	3198	A
hi Nancy well do you do a lot of dining out	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
well we do some- some dining out um i i do a lot of cooking so um	3146	A
mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and i i we don't go out too often as a family um unless it's like a fast food kind of thing	3146	A
but um but we do enjoy dining out one of our favorite places here in in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe i don't know if you have you ever been there	3146	A
um well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and uh	3146	A
have you the- now that's down in uh Highland Park it's Highland Park Village did you like it	3146	A
oh i love it	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
oh it is it's fabulous it really is good	3146	A
Atlantic Cafe is down on i believe it's on McKinney	3146	A
um and originally- originally the two the the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the- the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe and then they they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific	3146	A
and i loved them both i really do i think they're wonderful	3146	A
that's our favorite you know what we'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is Houston's have you been there	3146	A
it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in and	3146	A
as long as you know that it's okay but they have i think one just about the best prime rib	3146	A
um anywhere in the area i love it	3146	A
and my husband really likes their ribs so it's hysterical we go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't even look at the menu i know right away what we what we want yeah yeah	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
was it	3146	A
really i've never- i've i've been there for like you know lunch but i've never been there for dinner and it was good yeah	3146	A
oh that's great that's great another nice place for for prime rib is Baby Doe's	3146	A
Maxwell's nice have you been there	3146	A
oh and i didn't think we ate out very often Baby Doe's is nice and one place i'd never been that i would really like to go to	3146	A
uh is Lawry's i've heard that's real good Lawry's Prime Ribs	3146	A
i've i've never been there but i've heard it's real good	3146	A
yes yes actually they have one in Richardson that i've been to uh they have real nice lunches have you have you been there for lunch or yeah	3146	A
really	3146	A
really	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
the specials	3146	A
have you ever- been to Biffin's	3146	A
i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place	3146	A
over near Plano Super Bowl and uh i've i've not been there	3146	A
i've been there	3146	A
that was nice	3146	A
oh i've heard of it where where it's made it's like it's like a it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag and it's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something	3146	A
yeah	3146	A
oh	3146	A
oh	3146	A
oh	3146	A
oh i bet it was i bet it was	3146	A
the last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day and we took another friend with us and	3146	A
uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves and so we had they had uh like a	3146	A
berry assortment it was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom	3146	A
and you know they they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the	3146	A
plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it was really really relatively simple but oh it was good it was really good	3146	A
you can't find them yeah yeah yeah yeah you know i- i'm originally from Connecticut and uh	3146	A
i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and i was really amazed you know the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real	3146	A
real pretty	3146	A
but they lacked the service and they lacked the atmosphere- the just the i don't know the restaurants down here seem like they have uh	3146	A
i guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good	3146	A
and i thought i would really miss that	3146	A
uh-huh	3146	A
and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it	3146	A
ooh really	3146	A
okay	3146	B
no um we don't although we enjoy it um we do it more when we have company come um what about you	3146	B
i've heard of that but i haven't been there um where about is that	3146	B
oh okay i i've been to Cafe Pacific	3146	B
right	3146	B
yes um	3146	B
before- before we moved to the area my brother uh lived in Dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and we all ate there and oh their seafood was wonderful	3146	B
now where is the Atlantic Cafe	3146	B
oh okay	3146	B
no um but i've heard that's really good too and	3146	B
oh	3146	B
oh	3146	B
oh okay but-	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
you know right away what you want	3146	B
well we really enjoy prime rib too and uh actually the the Steak And Ale out here um	3146	B
we've gone to uh	3146	B
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night and uh the time we went the prime rib was really good	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
yeah yeah	3146	B
oh i've heard about that too but no we've uh i guess we eat out even less than i realize	3146	B
oh	3146	B
yeah	3146	B
yes i'd i had heard that too um	3146	B
have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway	3146	B
oh okay	3146	B
yes uh primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes but uh	3146	B
during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup and- or salad	3146	B
entrees and accompaniments and dessert and uh the my husband and i like veal uh a lot and their veal dishes have been good we've tried	3146	B
different ones when they've had them	3146	B
as one of the	3146	B
um-hum	3146	B
i yes no	3146	B
right and	3146	B
i haven't either uh one place and i've only been there for lunch but um i went with a friend and we met her husband um down on Greenville down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's	3146	B
oh i we just we- it was and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but um	3146	B
and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert uh which was a chocolate sack i don't know if you tried but or something-	3146	B
yes	3146	B
it yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry	3146	B
uh puree and we shared one the three of us and it was plenty because it was very rich but uh i wished i'd had a camera it was beautiful	3146	B
uh	3146	B
oh	3146	B
oh	3146	B
yes yeah	3146	B
oh	3146	B
it sounds wonderful	3146	B
well that's uh one of the things the- that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant uh i love fresh berries and their	3146	B
uh their fruits are always exceptional i don't i'm know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market uh you can't find them like that and	3146	B
uh-huh	3146	B
i would too because well i guess because we don't go out very often when we do go out um	3146	B
in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess and uh it is it's a whole experience of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too	3146	B
yeah	3146	B
um that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful it's called Cafe Max and it's at Plano Road and Campbell	3146	B
they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three	3146	B
boy i- i i don't know that's a that's a a tough one uh uh and it's uh i suppose it's it's	3107	B
changes as uh as perception- my perception changes of of what uh i'm getting gypped on this week or this month uh uh	3107	B
uh we're just uh going through uh uh well there's a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh	3107	B
if i step back i'm not sure i'd i'd uh say that what what about you	3107	B
oh okay	3107	B
yes	3107	B
okay but but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
right okay	3107	B
and and yeah and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
uh yeah i it uh	3107	B
the that- that is- that's a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there it's uh if i remember right you well if they	3107	B
they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh	3107	B
two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i i'm coming up on i've been at TI now uh uh	3107	B
coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah that's a that that is a a a negative but uh	3107	B
but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
well that that yeah that's uh that- that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh	3107	B
that's the the the uh yeah that- that's uh why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour	3107	B
and uh and but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing	3107	B
uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh	3107	B
the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different but uh	3107	B
but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh the they've uh uh	3107	B
gone through a couple years ago here where they	3107	B
uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now they're in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that	3107	B
just routine visits uh ah they will	3107	B
compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah	3107	B
well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh	3107	B
to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to uh uh give you	3107	B
you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're you're not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh i'm not i'm not sure it my uh	3107	B
one of the phrases i use is that that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of	3107	B
always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides here it's it's uh	3107	B
yeah uh and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh	3107	B
idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i	3107	B
i don't know in in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh	3107	B
although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better	3107	B
yeah	3107	B
yeah and	3107	B
there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary	3107	A
that week right	3107	A
um	3107	A
well um i uh right now i'm into a weird situation i'm a graduate student and uh	3107	A
uh i don't have that many benefits per se	3107	A
um	3107	A
sort of get	3107	A
yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um	3107	A
uh i think health insurance is real real important	3107	A
uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um	3107	A
a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance	3107	A
they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical they they force you to buy here now i'm covered by my wife's anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester	3107	A
for uh mandatory so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case i'd rather that that went to something else	3107	A
right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars	3107	A
sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're very- they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians	3107	A
so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um	3107	A
but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job i don't you know	3107	A
oh wow so that's the real	3107	A
yeah i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off they you know usually let her	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
oh really	3107	A
no	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
that's oh that's a	3107	A
that's reasonable i think	3107	A
yeah	3107	A
weigh are see such of things	3107	A
yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance	3107	A
and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so	3107	A
um-hum	3107	A
right	3107	A
at least us who decides	3107	A
right	3107	A
right you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that that's the	3107	A
well hi Nola this is Vic uh do you have any hobbies that uh that you really participate in	3132	A
oh	3132	A
is that right	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
oh	3132	A
do you have uh as part of your home schooling do you have any like uh handicraft type things that you've done with with your children	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
do you actually sew some clothes for them and that sort of stuff or have you before	3132	A
oh that's good	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
right	3132	A
um	3132	A
well that's nice	3132	A
something they can keep for a long time and enjoy later on	3132	A
keep them warm that's always beneficial too	3132	A
yeah	3132	A
well i think most of my hobbies are i don't really have any handicrafts that i can speak of i've done some woodworking type things but uh uh	3132	A
i don't really consider yard work a hobby either i guess it's uh	3132	A
yeah i do some of that and i i must admit that i do enjoy a certain amount of it i guess it's when it's a requirement such as mowing a lawn that it becomes somewhat less of a hobby	3132	A
yeah but um	3132	A
i'm interested in music so i do a few things in that regard	3132	A
well i uh uh my children are uh learning to play the piano	3132	A
and it's been ages ago since i played but i still like to sit down and and play around with the piano myself some	3132	A
and i have twelve year old daughter that's	3132	A
far surpassed any ability that i ever have had	3132	A
um	3132	A
yeah and uh also there's an instrument of all things called a recorder	3132	A
uh and i- i play that some just by ear i don't and music on that	3132	A
i used to play the clarinet and i still have one or actually recently just got another one and uh i play it from time to time as well	3132	A
well i am in a a church choir in fact it's that organization that uh it is doing this fund raising using uh	3132	A
uh the T I thing for that- for that- for that as a matter of fact and that's that's why i'm enrolled in this is our choir is doing it so that that i can pass a good bit of time and i do enjoy that a great deal	3132	A
um and i bike i bike ride i guess that's really the closest thing to a bonafide hobby that i have	3132	A
just a sort of combination between bicycling and exercise or hobby and an exercise so that's probably the extent of my hobbies	3132	A
um	3132	A
did you really well that's different	3132	A
uh-huh	3132	A
oh you had to play the	3132	A
yeah	3132	A
i bet that was	3132	A
that's very different	3132	A
uh	3132	A
well i'm not sure that it really matters a whole lot at all	3132	A
that's sort of been my interpretation of of these conversations um	3132	A
in fact i think we probably uh	3132	A
have talked long enough	3132	A
would be my guess so	3132	A
yeah oh i'm sure it's been adequate	3132	A
so i enjoyed talking with you	3132	A
and and good luck with your children	3132	A
all right bye-bye	3132	A
um most of my hobbies include three- three little girls	3132	B
they keep me pretty busy	3132	B
i uh we're home schooling	3132	B
so i um am real involved in learning how to teach and teaching and that kind of thing	3132	B
um i'm also we're expecting a baby in August so i've been trying to get some things in the house organized for that	3132	B
and have repainted a couple of chairs and repainted a dresser and some of that kind of thing um	3132	B
um yeah we do different things uh i sew so uh i haven't had a lot of time for it for a little while but um	3132	B
that's one thing that we do do some of um i	3132	B
oh yeah yeah um i	3132	B
have i can do lots of things and i enjoy lots of different things i don't have a lot time for most of them but when i do i like uh i like art i like uh	3132	B
the sewing um	3132	B
let's see what else	3132	B
i can do you know lots of different things like cross-stitch and different things but i just don't spend that much time on it uh quilting	3132	B
i've made quilts for the girls' beds and things like that um	3132	B
yeah something to cover them and keep them warm	3132	B
that's right	3132	B
um	3132	B
i think it could be i do a little bit of gardening	3132	B
yeah	3132	B
it's more tedious	3132	B
oh what do you do	3132	B
oh wonderful	3132	B

um-hum	3186	B
oh okay because_1 i was thinking well i- i grew up in Panama City i get it	3186	B
right	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
do you like Mexican do you like Mexican food oh	3186	B
well i mean there's so many places here you know they're just it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here	3186	B
but in the Addison well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area anyway	3186	B
i mean now there's a new Italian place called Sfuzzi	3186	B
that has a great i've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas and now there's one in Addison	3186	B
it's F S it's S F U Z I	3186	B
and it's on it's in Addison and it's a great place also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copeland's	3186	B
oh i really like Copeland's	3186	B
oh the yeah the i know no i don't like that place	3186	B
see uh uh yeah actually- actually when i went i thought the food was not good	3186	B
Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of	3186	B
see i when i went i thought the people drove me crazy first of all but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was	3186	B
um-hum	3186	B
do you like like Southwestern	3186	B
well now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill	3186	B
that's on Beltline that's close to Houston's a matter of fact and um	3186	B
it's great i mean they're they have i think sometimes i've been when i thought well it wasn't as good but i went there recently and i thought well this really is good	3186	B
so that's that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill	3186	B
and um	3186	B
a whole new dining experience	3186	B

okay	3186	B
okay well thanks for calling for helping us out bye-bye	3186	B
all right this is easy for me since i	3186	A
yeah well i travel i do about forty percent of my time is on the road	3186	A
i eat a lot of meals out um well i'm also married my wife is A1 cook but she enjoys eating out so i have to	3186	A
share it with her and uh actually it's very easy for me because i- i have a practice- make it a practice when i am out i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here	3186	A
so- so i look for just about anything and it's it's uh	3186	A
it's a lot of fun i don't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because_1 i you know	3186	A
oh sure yeah and it's it's really great i- i	3186	A
i like different types of food	3186	A
uh oh you name- okay you name it let's see you've got one down in uh	3186	A
down near uh Addison	3186	A
um there's two restaurants that i particularly like that i eat every time i get into Texas or i get into Atlanta Georgia i make sure i go and that's Houston's	3186	A
yep okay	3186	A
it's it's great there's a a restaurant in um	3186	A
right outside of Reading Pennsylvania it's called Alfredo's	3186	A
that does not look like	3186	A
a restaurant that you would really wanna recommend to a lot of people but it is fabulous- fantastic	3186	A
uh there's a restaurant and i don't recall the name of it uh in uh Panama City of course not too people wanna rush back to Panama City uh	3186	A
Panama	3186	A
the country Panama	3186	A
okay-	3186	A
no this is the country this is the country Panama all right	3186	A
and uh	3186	A
but i have gotten to quite a few and i go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there i	3186	A
you know and i know the locations and i know the places but i lot of times i don't remember the names i'd have to go back through some expense reports	3186	A
but particularly in down in your area i'm looking for some some more restaurants	3186	A
so i you know i don't know what's what's down there other the ones in Addison	3186	A
not particularly that's one of the few why which one were you gonna recommend	3186	A
uh-huh	3186	A
uh-huh	3186	A
right	3186	A
okay i have a	3186	A
okay let i'm i'm writing it down	3186	A
okay	3186	A
i've been there	3186	A
okay i've been there um one down there is the uh i think it's an old schoolhouse uh	3186	A
well i like the food but i don't care for the clowning around	3186	A
oh really	3186	A
oh i've had i	3186	A
that's it that's it i've had excellent food there	3186	A
true true	3186	A
uh-huh	3186	A
yeah all right well that's great uh no Italian that's fine i'm i	3186	A
make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's	3186	A
which is right down there in Addison-	3186	A
oh yeah	3186	A
all right	3186	A
really	3186	A
um-hum	3186	A
good	3186	A
well this is great this is gonna give me a	3186	A
some more places to go okay fine	3186	A
i guess our time's about up so	3186	A
uh well they don't always	3186	A
yeah i	3186	A
they've been doing that when uh the circuits are busy	3186	A
and uh other than that they you know leave you go about five minutes and then that that's about it i guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat so	3186	A
it was a pleasure talking you okay	3186	A
you bet	3186	A
bye-bye	3186	A
okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and and um trying to do go to school back to college again so it's	3193	A
it's uh exercise is kind of forget it	3193	A
they sure do yeah my daughter	3193	A
yeah yeah uh she's three so three with a i think it's almost like she's got this endless	3193	A
energy i mean it's no longer nap time that kind of thing so	3193	A
yes yeah so	3193	A
yeah	3193	A
exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of uh she's an only child too so it's it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's	3193	A
um-hum sure sure	3193	A
yeah uh-huh	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
um-hum sure	3193	A
um-hum -sure	3193	A
sure	3193	A
sure	3193	A
yeah yeah that's about what uh basically if we can get out and take a walk it's	3193	A
it's great but uh most of the time we can't so it's uh we're too busy doing other things but that also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah	3193	A
oh sure	3193	A
sure	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
sure	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
to loosen it up yeah yeah that's true	3193	A
so yeah-	3193	A
oh yes	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
uh-huh	3193	A
so oh boy	3193	A
sure trying to keep up with the nineteen months uh sure they're into everything	3193	A
the baby hm	3193	A
oh he was cranky	3193	A
sure once you lose that sure that's very true	3193	A
it wasn't too long ago where i was doing the same thing and that uh totally gets your mental capabilities uh thrown off totally when they're	3193	A
uh tired and uh you wake up in the middle of the night and it's my daughter used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that so	3193	A
daddy just came home so the house is starting to liven up here now but uh that's about it that's kind of how my exercise is right now is just basically running after a three year old	3193	A
so	3193	A
um-hum	3193	A
um-hum	3193	A
it sure does yeah	3193	A
sure sure well it was really nice talking to you then	3193	A
okay um-hum thank you um-hum bye now	3193	A
okay-	3193	B
well it	3193	B
but if it well- if i remember back to when i had a child they give you a lot of exercise just what age is your child	3193	B
uh-huh	3193	B
oh she's given up the naps	3193	B
oh right and so many people work nowadays there you know there's not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either	3193	B
but well my main uh exercise the only one i've ever stuck to at all is walking	3193	B
and i try to get out and walk two miles	3193	B
most everyday but but it you know it fluctuates i'll do real good for a while and then i'll be off of it for a while just depending on what's happened but the last uh	3193	B
couple of uh years uh my husband is an accountant and he moved his office to the house and i work for him	3193	B
so that helps because we're at home and i can get out and walk a lot better than when i was working in an office	3193	B
so that has helped	3193	B
but anything else uh	3193	B
well we have a lake house and down there when we go down there some on weekends we get a different type of exercise you know just doing a lot of work and things down there	3193	B
but that and uh and walking is about it	3193	B
um-hum i will admit though when i	3193	B
do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and	3193	B
uh i really do uh and and i smoke and i can tell that it just immediately if i've been coughing or something you know it just immediately seems to clear my lungs up	3193	B
but um	3193	B
well i got a lot of exercise though the last four or five days i have two grandchildren	3193	B
three months and nineteen months and my daughter and son-in-law went on a	3193	B
well and the baby was sick so he wasn't good you know so it took- was one on one i mean i had to take one and he had to take the other one and it was busy	3193	B
and they woke up all during the night and i'm not uh used to that	3193	B
uh-huh	3193	B
um-hum	3193	B
um um-hum	3193	B
right uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep it also made me think of one other thing walking	3193	B
does for me when i do it it does help me mentally you know if i'm worried about something or whatever and i get out and do that	3193	B
walk it just i don't know it just sort of helps your mental attitude too	3193	B
so i miss that when i don't do it	3193	B
but	3193	B
well nice to talk to you	3193	B
bye bye	3193	B
we do actually we have a a Golden Retriever a dog and we have a cat and we have we just got two um	3137	B
Russian Dwarf hamsters which dwarf hamsters lucky us huh	3137	B
real small they're maybe about oh two inches long they're real small they're real tiny they're cute they really are cute	3137	B
uh my son's baseball coach uh had two and then had multiple hamsters that he was trying to get rid of	3137	B
and so that's that's where we got them from now we've been assured they're both males and they're in two separate cages so we don't want any	3137	B
we don't want to go into the dwarf hamster business	3137	B
how about you	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
uh-huh is- uh is- are they very small uh-huh	3137	B
oh uh-huh	3137	B
oh really yeah	3137	B
oh no kidding uh-huh	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
oh	3137	B
um-hum	3137	B
are you yeah	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
really boy that's real unusual for cats usually you just put down a litter box and that's the end of that yeah	3137	B
um-hum	3137	B
um-hum um-hum	3137	B
really really huh huh	3137	B
oh	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
really really hum	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
really yeah yeah oh that's too bad	3137	B
sure sure sure	3137	B
yeah yeah well we were real fortunate with our pets um when my husband and i were getting married we we had both been married before and so we were blending families and we had taken this blended families course through uh	3137	B
P I S T you know they how they have the effective- parent parent training effectiveness- -effectiveness training	3137	B
and uh so we took a blended families course and Linda Hitt the person who was teaching the course said sometimes when you have children on this side and children on this side	3137	B
and uh so we- i had always wanted a Golden Retriever i just think they're real neat dogs that that's a nice breed you know they're real calm and gentle and	3137	B
and whatnot so my husband thought well for Christmas he was going to surprise me with a puppy and he was looking around for a puppy and	3137	B
then um he saw he decided just on a whim i think i'll call the SPCA	3137	B
and he called the Dallas SPCA and he said you wouldn't happen to have a Golden Retriever would you and they said you won't believe it but we had one dropped off last night	3137	B
and he'd they said he's AKC registered he's two years old and he's going to go fast	3137	B
so we thought okay what's wrong with this dog who would give up a two year old Golden Retriever you know that's a nice dog something's got to be wrong with this dog	3137	B
nothing is wrong with it we have had him now for three years and just love him to death he is wonderful yeah he is he's a great dog he's he's	3137	B
he's he's great he's great we just- we think he's wonderful	3137	B
and our cat just kind of you know pays us the time of day when he's in the mood and otherwise	3137	B
we don't see him	3137	B
yeah he is he comes in and he goes out he's he kind of	3137	B
you know is just around we we don't really don't see him except for feeding time you know or when he wants when he's in the mood for a little affection	3137	B
he'll show up yeah yeah	3137	B
but so that's our family and we just you know uh everybody seems to get along real well the kids the dog and the cat so we're okay	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
the hamsters actually it's the dog that is enthralled with the hamsters because the hamsters are recent you know they were just last week	3137	B
and	3137	B
the first night we had them	3137	B
somebody knocked over the cage and we thought it was the cat we really did we blamed the cat and we thought the hamster had disappeared and had been eaten but we found him he he just he narrowly escaped with his life but he was found	3137	B
but since then we have discovered the dog sits and watches them for hours on end	3137	B
you know they'll get going in the little wheel and he'll sit there and just stare at them so i'm wondering now if it really was the cat who knocked them off the shelf it might have been it might have been the dog	3137	B
but the cat doesn't seem to be too bothered with them it's it's the dog that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters it's it's funny	3137	B
yeah yeah	3137	B
uh-huh	3137	B
really	3137	B
out really	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3137	B
but he doesn't seem to be bothered with them you know he's real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he's he's not too bad	3137	B
but so are you going to try again with another cat sometime	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
yeah	3137	B
well uh Cathy do you have any pets in your home	3137	A
how nice um-hum	3137	A
dwarf hamsters	3137	A
how big is a dwarf hamster	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
my goodness where did you get those	3137	A
uh-huh	3137	A
well	3137	A
okay	3137	A
i was going to say that	3137	A
oh	3137	A
well right now we don't have any pets we've uh we've tried various things we you know obviously do have children	3137	A
and uh we tried a dog first and we had a a puppy a uh	3137	A
a what did they call him a Westie	3137	A
they're small uh-huh it's a terrier and uh that didn't work out very well	3137	A
and uh for a variety of reasons but the	3137	A
the dog was just all mouth and teeth it seemed like the only way it could of show affection was by nibbling you- on things	3137	A
yeah so it it never worked out and uh	3137	A
so we we have we gave up on that and then we tried cats	3137	A
and we ended up with a	3137	A
a bad set of cats if that's possible but i'm a i'm a big fan of cats i always had cats growing up	3137	A
and uh my wife on the other hand was not a fan of cats at all but we had these two that they we knew someone that uh uh you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and	3137	A
uh so we gave it a try	3137	A
and uh they were impossible to house train	3137	A
that's the end of that and these it was real strange and uh they were both solid white cats	3137	A
and uh one had blue eyes and the other had white- regular you know yellow eyed cats	3137	A
brothers and sisters and we had them declawed and we had them neutered and uh invested all all that money in it into it but uh we simply one of them in particular we just could not uh	3137	A
train to use we tried different types of litter changed it frequently and it was just unbelievable	3137	A
and so we finally found someone else that was willing to to to give it a try with them	3137	A
and sure enough it it worked- worked- worked for a little while and then they too couldn't seem to get them to use the litter box	3137	A
uh so they ended up finding someone else that was willing to give it a try and that's when i lost track of these two cats	3137	A
hum	3137	A
right	3137	A
right	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
good grief	3137	A
i'll bet yeah	3137	A
right-	3137	A
well that's great	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
is it primarily outdoor cat then or just	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
that's interesting	3137	A
he'll show up huh	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
great	3137	A
well has the cat discovered the uh the hamsters yet	3137	A
oh	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
oh my goodness	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
i'll be and my sister has tried that with both hamsters gerbils and small- birds	3137	A
and it's amazing what their cat has been able to do	3137	A
i think that pretty much over time has figured out a way to get those small creatures	3137	A
eventually to get them out to get the cage down from wherever it is even if it's the top of the refrigerator	3137	A
to get that cage down and into it somehow	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
um-hum	3137	A
yeah	3137	A
well i would like to we shall see i want it to be a you know indoor outdoor animal next time	3137	A
and uh	3137	A
okay how's the weather been in Plano	3185	A
right- yeah this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city	3185	A
uh well i don't know about you but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks	3185	A
and i'm ready for it to come back	3185	A
well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty five when we woke up and sixty six	3185	A
and today and i when i got up the the temperature said more like of course seventy nine or eighty	3185	A
so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather	3185	A
you don't are you a summer person	3185	A
are you	3185	A
well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i- i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as the	3185	A
my husband's from Nebraska and they have more of the four seasons	3185	A
oh you're used to that too	3185	A
you don't like the cold well i usually like it about sweater weather and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long it goes from hot and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer and then it's cold	3185	A
and i wish it were several months of that	3185	A
no	3185	A
oh yeah	3185	A
well sure it does that kind of schedule you really need a lot more sunshine	3185	A
and also the evenings are going to be getting uh darker sooner	3185	A
because as it gets cooler	3185	A
but i did a walk last night and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler	3185	A
well i agree absolutely and you know it's all relative because i was from west Texas and it was very dry and so i thought Dallas was awful	3185	A
and i still think so but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week and it was so humid there	3185	A
that your um all your windows were were wet every morning they had to get the squeegees and clean them off and when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because_1 it's kind of like what you're used to but i agree with you the humidity especially for curly heads like me	3185	A
yes i do not like the humidity	3185	A
um-hum	3185	A
yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does	3185	A
so uh but i- i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like i guess my my best would be probably	3185	A
sixty eight when you wake up or sixty six and then probably seventy five during the day	3185	A
yeah yeah are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds	3185	A
yeah so	3185	A
yeah just keep it there	3185	A
yeah	3185	A
well i do too i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of	3185	A
negative on it but then we started thinking especially in Plano the weather is so hot in August that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow	3185	A
static here	3185	A
yeah	3185	A
we do too i think a lot of people agree the same	3185	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3185	A
uh-huh now there have been worse summers in fact this morning when they were talking about uh Harold Taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder	3185	A
of the summers	3185	A
and milder fall everybody seems to be you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because_1 they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're just	3185	A
melting and then you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings and we'll it'll be too cold and they'll say well those are the ones that like the cold weather	3185	A
oh yeah he did he did it was it was really a shame he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them_1 did	3185	A
it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes	3185	A
oh is that right okay	3185	A
oh good	3185	A
well good well then have a good day and i hope you enjoy the weather this week	3185	A
basically about the same as what you've probably had	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
oh you like the rain do you	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
oh are you i don't care for that as much i'm a summer person i like the heat	3185	B
yeah and i'm from Utah so i- i like the four seasons i just don't like the cold	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
the thing the other thing is the i don't like the rain either	3185	B
well we have several children that are in sports and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on	3185	B
so	3185	B
i like it better that way um-hum	3185	B
um-hum	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
the thing about when it gets hot here is i don't like the humidity that i really don't care for that	3185	B
oh really	3185	B
oh is that right well another reason well i guess i can't say that it	3185	B
i don't like the rain completely we have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden and you know even i don't know	3185	B
if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain or it seems they thrive when it rains they just really	3185	B
um-hum yeah	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
well	3185	B
well i like seventies i like seventies okay	3185	B
oh i don't like nineties you can give me seventies and you can give me eighties and i'm okay but when it gets too hot then it's that i don't like that i stay in the house because it's just	3185	B
it's just too hot	3185	B
yeah yeah	3185	B
that's okay um i've i've thought about that too and um when we take our vacations we we do take them_1 in August sometimes so that we can be away from here	3185	B
it just really gets way when it gets way too hot it's	3185	B
and we've been here for several years and we've been here years when it's been hundreds	3185	B
and	3185	B
years um-hum	3185	B
yeah	3185	B
yeah he he always did such a good job i thought	3185	B
a good weatherman	3185	B
yeah	3185	B
anyway um	3185	B
i guess it's	3185	B
that's okay they say when you're done you're done so yeah i you don't have to wait for them_1 to say you're- cut off your time you just say have a good day or whatever you say you too	3185	B
you too	3185	B
you go ahead and start tell me how you'd you'd organize	3199	A
okay the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought first of all you needed to	3199	A
kind of about the same time every year like the same week of the the same month	3199	A
and and then you'd have to send out	3199	A
uh you know good flyers and then mail to all that you wanted to attend	3199	A
and of course food and fun are going to be your your	3199	A
ways to get people there um the ones that i've attended	3199	A
some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some of course just have lunch or	3199	A
um also like at Christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion	3199	A
and	3199	A
uh all kinds of events are usually held	3199	A
i've seen talents for mainly the kids that are there and	3199	A
you need probably information about your ancestors to tie that tie you together-	3199	A
well why don't you start because_1 you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind	3199	B
is uh kind of fun it's best done when you have leisure time and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now and	3169	A
i grew up in an area that uh it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had	3169	A
a variety of boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats	3169	A
um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer	3169	A
couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and	3169	A
got a new canvas sail for it and had a real huge- big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and	3169	A
we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice	3169	A
learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and	3169	A
um more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the storm- front blowing in and soon as the front came over	3169	A
it's it's a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess	3169	A
what are your memories of boating or current	3169	A
right	3169	A
it's true	3169	A
yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres	3169	A
and it was uh it had a lot of um	3169	A
turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go	3169	A
and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and snatched-	3169	A
pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and	3169	A
so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and	3169	A
before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up	3169	A
and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've i've uh	3169	A
done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i	3169	A
i- i know how	3169	A
you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess	3169	A
so life changes a little bit in that respect i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards i haven't	3169	A
craft- managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh	3169	A
yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of work-	3169	A
i'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something	3169	A
um about the only memories that i have of boating um my husband's family had a a motor boat um when we got engaged	3169	B
and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i- i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh	3169	B
driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting um	3169	B
you know they you they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the	3169	B
the laws were there and if you didn't obey them_1 uh	3169	B
you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but um i found the motor boating was real fun	3169	B
oh	3169	B
that sounds like a real challenge	3169	B
uh-huh	3169	B
hm	3169	B
well my son	3169	B
i guess that's all i do	3157	A
yeah	3157	A
um well i was thinking	3157	A
how the government has changed over in uh Europe and Russia	3157	A
you know	3157	A
all those countries becoming democratic for one thing	3157	A
um-hum	3157	A
i'm twenty seven	3157	A
um-hum	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
so it	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
and then i was thinking about how uh women's roles have changed	3157	A
uh	3157	A
i'm twenty seven by the way i was born in sixty four	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
okay	3157	A
okay	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
huh	3157	A
uh-huh that's true	3157	A
because_1 we might be liberated but now we all have to work and support ourselves and	3157	A
but uh it has it's pluses and minuses i guess	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
it's like a luxury now	3157	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3157	A
yeah it's hard work but it's like you have to have a husband that makes very good money in order to do that i guess	3157	A
uh-huh that's true	3157	A
well like uh my sister's younger than i am and i think that uh like they're all um	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh it's scary	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
yeah i guess like in the sixties and the seventies i was	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
the other way	3157	A
uh-huh i think you're right	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
unless they can get a cure	3157	A
unless they find a cure real soon	3157	A
for AIDS	3157	A
no i'm single	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
yes	3157	A
and uh	3157	A
uh-huh	3157	A
can you think of any other social issues government um	3157	A
uh do you have any idea how long we have to talk	3157	A
oh i didn't even look at the clock did you	3157	A
okay	3157	A
same here	3157	A
nice nice meeting you bye-bye	3157	A
is that it	3157	B
okay start them off	3157	B
oh yeah	3157	B
well uh i don't know what your age is but i know when i was growing up that uh	3157	B
communism course the big threat of communism {McCarthyism} back in the fifties and	3157	B
and everything there we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to get us and now	3157	B
communism is no more	3157	B
so that makes a huge difference to us	3157	B
uh	3157	B
pardon me	3157	B
you were born in sixty four okay i'm older than that i'm forty four	3157	B
i was born in forty seven so i've got a couple years on you and i can tell you that things	3157	B
things have changed a tremendous amount for women in the world	3157	B
since i you know first started	3157	B
i'm not sure i i'm not sure they're better	3157	B
that's true	3157	B
yeah i feel sorry for women who truly do wish to	3157	B
kind of follow the the older tradition and stay home and raise their family take care of the kids and people say what you don't work	3157	B
well yes i work all day long thank you very much	3157	B
yeah the cost the cost of living has gone	3157	B
just sky rocketed	3157	B
what do you think as far as the	3157	B
social morals the morals of people today as opposed to	3157	B
hum	3157	B
i i i really do i feel you know i look back and i have two children i have a daughter who's fifteen and my son is twenty	3157	B
and i mean it's very scary because_1 they are living in a totally different time with totally different fears	3157	B
than i grew up in	3157	B
you know	3157	B
five years ago	3157	B
even ten years ago before the threat of AIDS entered	3157	B
uh	3157	B
i think things were people were even possibly more promiscuous	3157	B
because you know well it was live and let live and everybody have a good time and we won't even think about the consequences	3157	B
i think the seventies maybe even the well in the eighties we started getting a	3157	B
a taste of it uh and people started saying whoa wait a minute	3157	B
and i don't know i think there may even be a turnabout	3157	B
in the nineties not immediately	3157	B
but as people become more and more	3157	B
terrified of the AIDS virus	3157	B
uh i think they're going to pull back sexually	3157	B
i think they're going to pull back and we may find the pendulum swings you know	3157	B
back the other way somewhat	3157	B
i i think we it has to	3157	B
or our uh we we won't survive our our world won't survive	3157	B
uh	3157	B
do you have children	3157	B
you're single then you are in the midst of this	3157	B
yeah it	3157	B
it's a different world for us	3157	B
no	3157	B
just three minutes	3157	B
oh yeah it's been three minutes dear	3157	B
okay i've enjoyed talking to you	3157	B
okay bye uh-huh bye-bye	3157	B
uh oh	3157	B
yes i do	3182	B
china painting and ceramics	3182	B
i enjoy it um-hum	3182	B
i enjoy the china more	3182	B
and now that i have my eyes corrected to the point that i can see the delicate part of china painting i do enjoy it	3182	B
my husband kept begging me and he's been dead now for twenty years so you understand that this was a long time ago	3182	B
but he finally brought me the china the book the brushes and he said i have made arrangements for your lessons	3182	B
and i said i'll do it for three months and if i don't like it that's it	3182	B
well i painted an awful lot until his death which was several years	3182	B
and it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable	3182	B
self satisfying thing i've had i	3182	B
i have sold quite a bit i give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home and then i just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it um-hum	3182	B
i have just retired	3182	B
yes	3182	B
no it's not it's a great hobby but don't retire oh it's	3182	B
oh have you- well	3182	B
wow	3182	B
oh i see-	3182	B
oh um-hum	3182	B
well if my sister is the seamstress of the two of us	3182	B
and but she doesn't china paint so we both have our expertise sided	3182	B
um what part of Ohio are you in	3182	B
yep	3182	B
yes	3182	B
well	3182	B
if you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can i mean a large flat plate hm	3182	B
that way you can get the feel of you're not cramped on these smaller objects	3182	B
that's right	3182	B
in Abilene Texas	3182	B
uh she just taught china painting um-hum and	3182	B
and when then we had so much fun there i had a friend from Albany which is about thirty six miles away	3182	B
and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home because she did our firing for us	3182	B
and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies and it was just such a delightful time	3182	B
and then after i beg pardon	3182	B
i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had to go to work after my husband's death	3182	B
so i have put it aside for a little while but i'm i have just found me an instructor to get started again um-hum	3182	B
oh i know	3182	B
of course i just have one beautiful peonies- with peonies uh umbrella stand and i have two daughters and they're both	3182	B
do you have any hobbies	3182	A
what are yours	3182	A
ooh how great	3182	A
oh uh ceramic painting	3182	A
the china more	3182	A
how did you ever get into that that sounds so interesting	3182	A
how marvelous- i	3182	A
now do you do it just for yourself or do you do it to give as gifts or do you actually sell it	3182	A
oh that sounds marvelous- now do you work outside of the home	3182	A
uh don't retire well see i don't i never uh returned to work for the past- i have stayed home for about the last nine years	3182	A
we've transferred around and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake uh on Lake Erie	3182	A
so the lake life appealed to me and my husband's working and he left it up to me if i worked or not	3182	A
so in my spare time i love to sew there aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing	3182	A
but i do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home so i enjoy doing my uh toppers for my window applications	3182	A
and things like that but uh just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great	3182	A
that is excellent	3182	A
we're in the suburb- i'm in the suburb of Cleveland and i'm about um	3182	A
fifteen miles probably from downtown Cleveland something like that and Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie and prior to this we were fifty miles west from here so we were right on the lake	3182	A
and Cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard and you do find people uh into the crafts and the things that uh	3182	A
various things for spare time but i have never heard and i have actually never run into anyone into the china painting and i'm just intrigued with it	3182	A
right where you're getting into the delicate work now do you where- where did you first get your lessons from	3182	A
through a uh an adult ed or uh strictly a china type	3182	A
oh how marvelous	3182	A
oh and it's so nice it must be so nice for you now that you're retired	3182	A
oh isn't that great and you'll probably really uh regain- regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a a class again	3182	A
okay	3154	B
well let's see well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for	3154	B
glass and	3154	B
glass and uh plastics and uh we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full i guess we collect milk- milk cartons and	3154	B
whatever plastics- other plastics are acceptable	3154	B
no no i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet	3154	B
right well no i haven't seen any so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and i'm	3154	B
kind of anxious to see them	3154	B
oh right	3154	B
right	3154	B
right	3154	B
oh	3154	B
oh of course that they did you know actually we had milk delivered to our house	3154	B
in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house	3154	B
you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there so uh	3154	B
yeah	3154	B
right right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it it it stays i mean it's just	3154	B
to see stacks and stacks of newspapers	3154	B
just to the trash is just amazing so uh	3154	B
you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty well there's a pretty- pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics	3154	B
so that's kind of encouraging i didn't know you know i- i didn't know if we started to do that i didn't know what to expect	3154	B
right	3154	B
well i guess they will shortly i guess	3154	B
oh right	3154	B
yeah	3154	B
right do you know i saw in Tom Thumb yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small Coke bottles	3154	B
and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not	3154	B
they were glass they were the glass uh well let's see they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or	3154	B
six ounce or ten ounce	3154	B
sort of a small size	3154	B
sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack	3154	B
stick them down you know uh sort of of sort of a basket type thing with the divisions right right so i just hadn't seen that in a long time	3154	B
yeah yeah well	3154	B
no he doesn't like the paper sacks and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't doesn't just	3154	B
right right	3154	B
that's nice i guess they dump it the same place i wonder where they dump that the same place	3154	B
yeah yeah well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in they have this day now that it's you know separate from the other trash pick up	3154	B
um	3154	B
no	3154	B
are are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the	3154	A
other containers yet for recycling	3154	A
well maybe they don't i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were	3154	A
yeah the	3154	A
that's going to be interesting because it's uh we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is	3154	A
uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage	3154	A
so that i don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where uh	3154	A
uh it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people	3154	A
uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh	3154	A
growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery	3154	A
would candle them and package them	3154	A
is that uh in the fifties	3154	A
uh you could say we had	3154	A
the recycling going on then that we should have now	3154	A
which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got	3154	A
a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them	3154	A
oh	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
so uh you know i look back at	3154	A
at uh my	3154	A
childhood and i'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this	3154	A
uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
yeah well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper	3154	A
uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans	3154	A
uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh	3154	A
i don't have any habits there yet and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction but	3154	A
but it just seems like on the larger scale that	3154	A
you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if uh	3154	A
if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect	3154	A
uh than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so	3154	A
outside my little town	3154	A
we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
i well that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
the carton the paper carton	3154	A
yeah	3154	A
well i mean the you- you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood	3154	A
uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty four bottles and	3154	A
and uh	3154	A
uh i'm not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now	3154	A
well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh	3154	A
doesn't really like the paper sacks	3154	A
yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise	3154	A
uh oh i'm i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh	3154	A
Neal's a person who says i like to pick it up but i don't believe in throwing it into the uh	3154	A
the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us don't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh	3154	A
to do that	3154	A
uh so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on	3154	A
well there's someplace you know if it's because_1 really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty four hours	3154	A
uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh	3154	A
so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's	3154	A
it's certainly usable material	3154	A
uh-huh	3154	A
right	3154	A
but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when it's one thing to send grass there but i've trimmed trees and other things which uh	3154	A
end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly but it's still natural and i just don't know	3154	A
-TV show	3179	A
huh why	3179	A
um-hum	3179	A
i like silly ones compared to now i like um Perfect Strangers	3179	A

uh i don't know if you've ever heard that joke he's like uh he said that show is prejudice because they have like the dumbest hugest black women on that show and they run down and they're like	3179	A
and its just funny you just have to see him because_1 he's like grabbing himself and	3179	A
uh-huh it's funny	3179	A

hm	3179	A
become	3179	A
um-hum	3179	A
hm	3179	A
well	3179	A
huh that's the news station	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
that's like Good Morning America i think if you watch it long enough i think they repeat at least like the headlines	3179	A
and	3179	A
so	3179	A
um-hum well at least you know the news real well	3179	A
and people think are impressed by wow how do you know all this stuff	3179	A
huh	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
huh	3179	A
um trying to think of some other shows do you like The Three Stooges	3179	A
really because_1 a lot of guys like The Three Stooges and they drive me crazy	3179	A
huh i know how about cartoons do you like to watch cartoons	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
my sister loves anything like that Bugs Bunny or	3179	A
hm	3179	A
and um	3179	A
hm	3179	A
i like uh i used to like Pee Wee Herman before they took it off	3179	A
Pee Wee's Playhouse	3179	A
uh-huh	3179	A
well they said he might do something else now like branch off a different way like maybe more adult humor or something	3179	A
yeah uh-huh i like that stuff i mean he was always a pervert you know it didn't surprise me when he got caught you know doing that	3179	A
uh-huh yep	3179	A
huh	3179	A
yeah because_1 they're repeats now or they were repeats before they took them_1 off	3179	A
uh probably LA Law	3179	B
uh i don't know i like all the court cases and uh the romance between everybody uh what about you	3179	B
oh okay my fiance likes that	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah she likes that too we always have to tape all those on Fridays	3179	B
oh yeah America's Favorite Home Videos yeah on Sundays	3179	B
yeah that's all right	3179	B
i like The Price is Right too but i never get a chance to watch it	3179	B
no huh-uh	3179	B
yeah i'm always gone at eleven	3179	B
yeah or i just miss it	3179	B
yeah i used to watch it all the time though i never missed it	3179	B
no i never heard of that oh wait is that on like at nine or ten or something yeah yeah i've watched that before it's all right	3179	B
oh okay i never seen that	3179	B
oh so i'll have to watch it tonight	3179	B
yeah i usually have the TV on just for background noise all the time	3179	B
yeah i don't i don't think it's ever off	3179	B
yeah i just turned it off when the phone rang	3179	B
no i can't stand those	3179	B
do- oh wow that's that's odd two people actually don't like them_1	3179	B
yeah i think they're the stupidest shows	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah those all right Sixty Minutes is okay	3179	B
oh really	3179	B
oh that's a good idea so television's actually useful	3179	B
yeah it seems like we have cable and there's never anything on we just have more of nothing	3179	B
oh it comes with our apartment so you're not the huh	3179	B
no huh-uh	3179	B
i'm in Pennsylvania	3179	B
oh	3179	B
hm	3179	B
no we have to have cable because_1 we're up in the mountains and you can't get anything	3179	B
but there's nothing on TV ever hardly	3179	B
oh we we can't get anything we can get like one	3179	B
without it	3179	B
it's all right i don't think it's that bad	3179	B
but there's never anything on	3179	B
it's just background noise again	3179	B
oh	3179	B
right in the middle	3179	B
yeah Center County	3179	B
yeah we don't have any TV stations in this city so they're all from other cities	3179	B
yeah i guess we watch a lot of CNN too	3179	B
yeah but it always repeats like every half hour so we watch the same thing every half hour	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah after like an hour or so you just watch everything again and again and again	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah then you get sick of watching like man not this story again you don't pay attention to anything	3179	B
no i like Laurel and Hardy though	3179	B
yeah i never got into them much	3179	B
yeah i like the Road Runner cartoons	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah they're not on that often though	3179	B
least not around here	3179	B
yeah i guess no one will be watching that anymore	3179	B
yeah that's what he started doing anyway	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah i wasn't too surprised either didn't look like him though	3179	B
all the pictures	3179	B
yeah i've seen that show twice and it was the same one both times	3179	B
i guess i never will see it anymore	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
yeah	3179	B
hi um	3175	A
basically i wear pants i'm a real pants person and um like when i'm at home since and- and i'll say i'm a homemaker	3175	A
since that's my basic thing um	3175	A
i wear a pantsuit most of the time not a pantsuit i guess pants and a shirt	3175	A
and um in the summertime i wear cotton tops cotton top shirts and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters i like sweaters a lot	3175	A
and so i do that but when i go out for meetings	3175	A
uh then i will wear either uh skirts or um a dress	3175	A
and i have a couple of pantsuits because_1 those are real in at this time but	3175	A
that's basically what i do	3175	A
oh	3175	A
um-hum	3175	A
right	3175	A
well that sounds nice	3175	A
um it said the seasons do do you change much through the season or	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
yeah yeah	3175	A
right	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
then maybe	3175	A
yeah	3175	A
um well i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway and so my note change dramatically over the years if i need something new i will go and buy it	3175	A
but basically i'm a a pretty much the same in the summertime i wear the light cotton and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters	3175	A
and so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either	3175	A
and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i	3175	A
i i enjoy that but it just wouldn't be um	3175	A
smart for me to do that in my home with my children	3175	A
so i have to um	3175	A
think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i don't know if they consider that a job i don't really get paid for that	3175	A
uh often but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike	3175	A
um but it doesn't really change in my clothing style	3175	A
yeah yeah	3175	A
oh	3175	A
uh-huh	3175	A
oh dear	3175	A
that's not helpful	3175	A
yeah i guess so well it's been great talking to you have a great day bye	3175	A
-hello	3175	B
well i think our tastes are fairly similar- similar although i'm i government worker i do tend to i'm um a scientist	3175	B
so that technically i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes but for the most part i don't i wear fairly respectable looking shoes and	3175	B
and a pantsuit of sort- one sort or another	3175	B
and um	3175	B
i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have some- have visitors or have to give talks	3175	B
right	3175	B
no actually i guess this summer i i wore some fairly nice jeans um more than i wore- have in previous seasons	3175	B
but um no i tend to to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer	3175	B
i don't know whether they think by	3175	B
right um yeah i don't i don't	3175	B
i you know i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends	3175	B
and i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of of secretaries was you know overdress overkill sort of and	3175	B
in a sense- uh in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries	3175	B
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public	3175	B
it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here	3175	B
you know i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up	3175	B
um-hum um-hum	3175	B
right	3175	B
um-hum um-hum	3175	B
um-hum	3175	B
exactly i mean you can look businesslike in in a pantsuit- uh the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things	3175	B
yeah i'm i'm really glad about that pantsuits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics	3175	B
and so i used to have a problem when when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash	3175	B
so	3175	B
right right but otherwise now i'm i i guess we're both pretty practical	3175	B
okay well have a good day bye-bye	3175	B
um a little bit during the school year we're um	3110	B
definitely expected to wear hosiery and you know things like that although we can wear slacks	3110	B
um during during the school year and of course that's a good idea because	3110	B
i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and	3110	B
you know so it's pretty important to um i also like very much the new split skirts	3110	B
you know because then you've	3110	B
oh that's oh that's true the old culottes that's right but those are just real comfortable and um	3110	B
you know allow you the privacy and all	3110	B
the only	3110	B
uh no i think it needs to be longer probably if it's split it it varies though between the principal- from one principal to another	3110	B
there are some like	3110	B
um some principals insist that you not wear um anklet type shorts	3110	B
i mean socks	3110	B
um that you have to wear hose- you know hose but i know of other schools	3110	B
where they wear um you know anklets and	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
how embarrassing i know i hate that you really have to check on the	3110	B
check on the length well we wear the knee high ones a lot too so	3110	B
do you wear um suits very much	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
yeah right	3110	B
um-hum um-hum	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
yeah	3110	B
i am too and i	3110	B
uh i've been here seventeen years	3110	B
but i'm from	3110	B
but i'm from Illinois	3110	B
that's right that's right	3110	B
that's right	3110	B
right all right that really is nice	3110	B
i um i'm kind of a pack rat especially when it comes to clothes	3110	B
and i i mean i still have some sweaters that i had you know from before i moved down here things that were were wool or just you know really nice things and	3110	B
and really very seldom get to wear them and should certainly get rid of probably all of them	3110	B
but like i said i'm kind of a	3110	B
at the beginning of the winter	3110	B
now that is silly isn't it	3110	B
yeah	3110	B
are you from here then	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
well the thing is that you know it it does get cold but it's just such a short season you know and you just	3110	B
can't wear that much	3110	B
oh how nice	3110	B
Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit	3110	B
huh where have you found them	3110	B
um but they carry them_1 at Dillard's	3110	B
hum i'll have to look at those that sounds interesting	3110	B
um-hum um-hum well you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and i i really do too i just i don't know i'm really comfortable in	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
um-hum i like that too	3110	B
that's real good very well	3110	B
that's exactly right	3110	B
oh well	3110	B
for work	3110	B
well you you work year round right yeah	3110	B
um-hum	3110	B
um-hum that's true	3110	B
yeah that's true well i have more summer stuff i guess	3110	B
for that kind of casual because_1	3110	B
we do go on a um	3110	B
i go back to Illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husband's	3110	B
mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there so	3110	B
uh in fact i was thinking this summer that since i'm doing summer school i haven't	3110	B
worn hardly- very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them_1 all together so	3110	B
to take them_1 on our trip	3110	B
oh how nice	3110	B
well i took i went through my closet this spring and i	3110	B
i took some stuff out	3110	B
and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because i'm so tired of looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight	3110	B
but it isn't so much too tight i mean i could easily well maybe not too easily but i could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and you know and there are things that i really don't want to get rid of you know i really want	3110	B
to keep them because they're nice and so i thought well i'll put them_1 in there and then maybe i'll feel so bad that i can't wear them now	3110	B
but so far	3110	B
oh that's funny	3110	B
yeah that's right hey when you have kids you definitely have to have	3110	B
oh	3110	B
you think they're hinting	3110	B
yeah that's right	3110	B
ooh yeah you'll be glad believe me oh because_1	3110	B
um	3110	B
oh	3110	B
it's just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is	3110	B
um is when the kids get	3110	B
old enough that they really care what they're wearing	3110	B
my kids are twelve and fifteen	3110	B
on the other hand they can be pretty picky and you know	3110	B
i mean i could get away with	3110	B
you know with	3110	B
it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because	3110	B
they didn't care	3110	B
anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of	3110	B
certain kind of jeans and the the shoes are just about the worst	3110	B
uh	3110	B
gee um my son just came out the other day and he's his	3110	B
what is it i think they're Reebok	3110	B
whatever my other son has Nike Airs at the moment but these Reeboks	3110	B
and i was thinking he bought them in March	3110	B
it was early March he bought them and they are demolished	3110	B
i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them	3110	B
the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean that's how worn out they are	3110	B
and they cost- i bought them on a wonderful sale at Mervyn's they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars	3110	B
on that much of a sale	3110	B
and my husband and i were just talking you know it's	3110	B
i mean we're talking minimum of three of those a year	3110	B
that's a hundred and eighty dollars a year for his tennis shoes	3110	B
you know and my husband	3110	B
oh it's just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of of really good you know work leather nice	3110	B
men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes he said	3110	B
but i'll be- still be wearing them in ten years	3110	B
so anyway	3110	B
before we go visit grandma	3110	B
okay so uh during the summertime do you dress differently than than you would when school's going on	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
oh really	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
but those aren't that new i mean i have some that were way old yeah	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
yeah they're very nice do you can you get away with wearing the shorter ones style the ones that really look like shorts kind of	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
oh yeah	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses i when i dress to go to work my dresses are pretty long and um	3110	A
i couldn't find any hose one day but i found some knee highs so i put those on and the wind caught my skirt and he said what have you got on	3110	A
yeah it was real funny	3110	A
yeah it's pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so	3110	A
the one day that i did it and i got caught	3110	A
um no i really don't my don't- i work for a computer company but it's not uh real visual i mean it's not like an IBM where you have to wear your blue suit	3110	A
but um i can get away with wearing dresses a lot which i really enjoy	3110	A
because especially i mean you know it's nice sometimes in in a suit because if you're hot inside or cold or you know whatever you have your jacket but uh i'm more comfortable in a dress	3110	A
so but	3110	A
the best thing are you from Texas	3110	A
oh well you qualify	3110	A
oh well see that's what's so funny because_1 so many girls move down here from the north and they have these heavy wool suits and it's like God what do i do with that	3110	A
i said well that's the best part about Texas you can buy uh one dress that you can wear pretty much all through unless like it's the like- two cold months and winter- in December	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
um-hum	3110	A
yeah but you'd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale	3110	A
really hum	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well that's really weird because_1 last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so	3110	A
well yeah Oklahoma and Texas so i mean Oklahoma did get colder in the winter but um i guess i just didn't notice it because_1 i never really dressed very warm so	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well and i found a new dressmaker so that i just am crazy about the style of the dresses so	3110	A
i've been yeah i mean i go into every store and i i go do you have Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like i'm strange but	3110	A
it's called Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit and they are the neatest dresses they just are very flattering to your figure and um	3110	A
um i've been fortunate i've found them in in a catalog and then they're a lot cheaper than you can find them_1 at Dillard's	3110	A
so um	3110	A
yeah they do have them_1 at Dillard's and	3110	A
yeah i really enjoy them_1 i've gotten- i've and it's real funny too because i've had a lot of compliments on them_1 when i wear them so	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
well i'm short and i've been told that if you wear the longer skirt it gives you it- it gives you more of an elongated look	3110	A
so um i've always been more comfortable in the longer ones	3110	A
so	3110	A
but anyway but i don't have any play clothes because_1 i spend all my money on clothes that i wear to work	3110	A
so on the weekends and	3110	A
yeah but it's just kind of frustrating because_1 on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes	3110	A
so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend	3110	A
put them_1 with my shorts or something	3110	A
um	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah well i've lost weight recently so i'm now getting to dig out the things that i haven't worn for a while so that's kind of fun	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
yeah well that's something my husband says what are we going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of those because_1 i i have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and it's like what are we going to do	3110	A
said well we'll have to get a bigger house	3110	A
oh i know and then plus- well my sisters have had their children and so now they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me	3110	A
and i'm like well what am i going to do with all this stuff	3110	A
i don't think it will fit my dog	3110	A
yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because_1 then i've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a boy and a girl	3110	A
so that worked out yeah	3110	A
sure i will be because_1 God- i was i was in Foley's the other day and i turned the wrong direction and i ended up in the little kids' clothes and i just picked up something for my niece and it was just it was like thirty bucks i thought golly	3110	A
oh yeah i can imagine	3110	A
oh	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
um-hum	3110	A
yeah definitely	3110	A
oh God yeah i can imagine	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
oh	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
wow	3110	A
on sale	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
oh my gosh	3110	A
maybe i won't have kids	3110	A
uh-huh	3110	A
wow	3110	A
yeah	3110	A
oh no	3110	A
i just can't imagine	3110	A
yeah really well my mother had three girls but i don't remember being that picky about my clothes-	3110	A
i'm Doug	3197	A
from Pennsylvania	3197	A
yeah okay so anyway now we're talking about drug testing an all that and you ready okay so what do you think about it	3197	A
right- right i agree with you basically so might be a boring conversation but um but anyway i agree that	3197	A
um only when there's any question of safety does the employer have a right because otherwise i feel that	3197	A
the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance whether you're able to do the job up to par and	3197	A
that and if that can be done it shouldn't matter whatever the employee might do in his private life	3197	A
okay	3197	A
yeah	3197	A
yeah that	3197	A
well probably at least on the average	3197	A
uh-huh	3197	A
yeah	3197	A
um-hum	3197	A
right certainly and certainly in any case people who drink alcohol a lot are probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs don't include that	3197	A
they're really interested in looking for illegal drugs it seems to be more for the purpose of law enforcement than for	3197	A
the purpose of the employer's best interest for the job	3197	A
yeah um	3197	A
well we're supposed	3197	A
uh that's Miles Davis yeah	3197	A
uh right exactly it's on the radio	3197	A
um so	3197	A
anyway	3197	A
right	3197	A
okay	3197	A
yeah i guess not and i think we've said about what we have to say sure thing bye bye	3197	A
hi how you doing Doug my name's Brad where- where you from	3197	B
oh okay i'm from New York	3197	B
right right	3197	B
yep okay	3197	B
oh i definitely i- i think it shouldn't be if it may be the only exception is when there's public safety involved you know bus drivers uh train train motormen stuff like that you know	3197	B
right	3197	B
uh you know but i- i- i think that uh i mean people think that they have an interest in in finding things like this out about their employers because it's	3197	B
probably and and maybe it's true that that if if you if you tested people and if they were drug users	3197	B
probably i mean i might even agree with you that they're probably gonna to be less productive employees um i'm not sure about that but i would say that that that may be that might be a good indication	3197	B
but but you could also you might be able to tell by a person's uh you know whether they're overweight or underweight	3197	B
uh you know you might make certain value judgments about that you can make value judgments probably about- about a number of different things that are clearly within the realm of someone's private ability	3197	B
you know private- you know private interest or or you know i'm trying looking for a word in other words you know maybe maybe uh heavier people uh	3197	B
tend to not be as good workers you know or maybe maybe extra uh uh ultra thin people tend to not be as good workers maybe people that smoke cigarettes aren't as good workers uh you know	3197	B
sure	3197	B
yeah yeah	3197	B
that's true that's true	3197	B
so we could talk about pets that was my last subject you know	3197	B
what's that music in the background	3197	B
oh okay a little tribute to him or	3197	B
ah	3197	B
that's a good background for this conversation all right well anyhow nice talking to you i- i don't think we have to stay on the whole time and we've we've agreed too much	3197	B
okay take care have a good day bye bye	3197	B
um-hum	3194	A
that's okay	3194	A
that's okay it it's more uh concentrated so they know where you are	3194	A
um anyway uh i know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are um Kroger and some of the other stores too have said	3194	A
if you bring your bags back to uh to the store to recycle	3194	A
then they'll pay you a certain amount of money and that's one thing that started in the community	3194	A
um-hum	3194	A
um-hum yeah i know Kroger will do it and i think Albertson's does it sometimes i'm not sure	3194	A
um and and yet i know that uh	3194	A
some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the	3194	A
the uh community like through the schools or things like that	3194	A
so um that's always helpful and i know that we have- we have the the can	3194	A
the can different can banks around the city	3194	A
that you can go to and do that	3194	A
um one of the ways i don't know uh if this would be helpful it said on the	3194	A
the computer what do i think would be helpful and i don't know if it would be helpful or not but i know on Monday the the garbage men pick up like just	3194	A
um	3194	A
uh any limbs or any extra trash that you might have	3194	A
and that might be an extra day to put out uh things that might be recycled if we had a a certain	3194	A
colored can to put them_1 in or or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
uh i know getting a newspaper everyday i know i could just you know	3194	A
do that	3194	A
because i have to pick it up and it just goes out with our trash and i guess i'm not as um	3194	A
recycling minded as i should be but uh that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled	3194	A
so	3194	A
did you	3194	A
tell me	3194	A
um-hum	3194	A
now do you have to take like labels off of those jars	3194	A
uh-huh	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
take them_1 off yeah	3194	A
soda both liter sodas can you do that okay	3194	A
right right	3194	A
i i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just um get it into different categories like that and	3194	A
i- i don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it i	3194	A
i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know	3194	A
okay_1	3194	A
yeah	3194	A
uh-huh	3194	A
oh	3194	A
all set actually i'm in Plano too i say Dallas area when i'm talking to people elsewhere	3194	B
yeah	3194	B
they actually pay you money for that hm um Brookshires up in Allen	3194	B
uh you bring your bags back you know they uh the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them_1 in the one of the receptacles there but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that hm	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
interesting	3194	B
right	3194	B
right	3194	B
yeah i think they already do that out east um they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go it's uh it's pretty bad all these years we've been	3194	B
especially in this country all the uh	3194	B
the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and uh so what i do is uh	3194	B
it's not bad you just have to have a place to keep everything but uh it you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it	3194	B
just put your paper in the same place every day and it'll start stacking up take your glass um you know pickle jars or or whatever um uh liquid jars you know and just	3194	B
rinse them_1 out a little bit and put them all in a place and uh plastics	3194	B
no from what i understand uh you can leave the labels on um although i rip rip them_1 off i don't i don't scrub them_1 or anything i just tear them_1 off	3194	B
throw the lids and everything out but uh put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs uh orange juice jugs things like that	3194	B
yes those also um and then of course uh cans Coke cans whatever	3194	B
but uh you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up there's a lot that we throw out	3194	B
um-hum	3194	B
it's yeah it's not a big deal you get used to it one let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and uh	3194	B
and i said hey um i understand y'all are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them and they had told me that when they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there	3194	B
and they said well you know people come in and put anything in the receptacles and what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags Kroger or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them_1	3194	B
yeah and it's it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number like um bags from Drug Emporium have a four-	3194	B
okay um does is this something that concerns you	3143	B
uh-huh	3143	B
right	3143	B
yeah well i live outside of Dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year	3143	B
in Dallas and that worries me	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
yeah there's a little boy that just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is	3143	B
you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet	3143	B
that's really sad i've so you know it must be frustrating-	3143	B
frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that	3143	B
be so scary	3143	B
it really doesn't it's kind of scary i think that uh	3143	B
i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient	3143	B
i think that's part of the problem	3143	B
yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded you know let them suffer a little bit	3143	B
yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it	3143	B
yeah it- the other thing that worries me about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill	3143	B
people they i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
oh	3143	B
yeah	3143	B
seems like if they had immediate- more immediate uh consequences to their actions it would sink in faster	3143	B
really yeah	3143	B
yeah because_1 it seems like now even in the country you hear about	3143	B
bad things happening so	3143	B
yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools	3143	B
me either	3143	B
yeah seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that	3143	B
it seems scarier	3143	B
really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah that's scary it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore	3143	B
yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because	3143	B
they won't let them hire any new ones and they keep leaving	3143	B
huh yeah they figure what a heyday huh	3143	B
it really is well there's someone at the door so i guess i'll have to go see what my dog is barking about but it was nice talking to you	3143	B
well thanks same for you bye	3143	B
well i think it does um especially because i just moved to Massachusetts and uh they're having real problems because they have so many uh police layoffs	3143	A
and uh personally i don't live in a real bad section of town but uh just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car and there's a lot of crime within a few miles of me	3143	A
how about you	3143	A
yeah i uh	3143	A
yeah i recently moved here and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town and uh my husband was was what he his concerns were well not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just	3143	A
be an innocent bystander just to be in that location and i thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way	3143	A
but	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
yeah that exactly-	3143	A
exactly what happened down here	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime and it doesn't seem like anything is working	3143	A
but in in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes	3143	A
that's true maybe the punishment should be more severe	3143	A
i know it	3143	A
yeah	3143	A
exactly- exactly- exactly because they get involved in things so young that they don't really realize what they're involved in	3143	A
and uh some people prey on that you know they'll take uh kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen	3143	A
and uh get them involved in things because	3143	A
uh well i don't know i was watching on a movie on TV i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything	3143	A
so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial	3143	A
i think it would concern me even more if i had children which i don't but if i had children i wouldn't know where to raise them to protect them	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
it's true they uh and they they talk about too the gangs	3143	A
spreading you know like everybody thinks of them only in LA and New York but they spread out	3143	A
to cover more area and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in Texas do they	3143	A
that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group and i think that a lot of people that sort of control them	3143	A
control what they're doing are older you know business you know trying to control whatever you know	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
it's true and the weapons my God the weapons that people have are some people are more- seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them	3143	A
uh-huh	3143	A
that's the other thing uh is	3143	A
it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday	3143	A
i	3143	A
uh	3143	A
yeah i just read an article yesterday um where this what used to be a nice town in this area	3143	A
they had a lot of budget cutbacks	3143	A
Massachusetts is broke right now and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well	3143	A
and so it's like	3143	A
this is a depressing conversation though	3143	A
okay i hope things look up	3143	A
bye-bye	3143	A
uh-huh	3142	A
yes	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
do you usually go out uh with the children or without them	3142	A
right	3142	A
yes	3142	A
yes	3142	A
yes	3142	A
well i	3142	A
no i-	3142	A
uh well uh we don't have any children so uh we tend to like to try all sorts of different things and uh we're very attracted to exotic food	3142	A
and uh we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and uh sort of gourmet Mexican and uh things like that	3142	A
as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and uh Chinese and things and and things of that sort now yes of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too	3142	A
and uh we probably go out one to two times a week	3142	A
and uh	3142	A
uh we're pretty much regulars at an Italian local Italian restaurant	3142	A
Momo's	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
i've heard about it i haven't been in there	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
that's- that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me	3142	A
i i like different kinds of food so when we go out i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican restaurant like something other than uh you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and	3142	A
fajitas now	3142	A
yes yes and once in a while things backfire i mean we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that and i'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try we'll try anything just about Ethiopian we've had Ethiopian	3142	A
and uh not in Plano of course but we really we really do enjoy going out and uh and i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires	3142	A
yeah i think that we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant how do you usually find a a new restaurant	3142	A
uh-huh so do we	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
right	3142	A
uh-huh we have found uh a number of restaurants either through D and the Friday paper and sometimes the the Observer which my husband usually picks up	3142	A
and also through coupons when a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons and you know when they say you know buy one get one free	3142	A
it's hard to resist so we'll go in and very often we'll find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they give they they no longer give coupons we'll we'll uh we'll stay there	3142	A
but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper- through the newspaper reviews	3142	A
i mean it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that	3142	A
it's very expensive to go out to eat	3142	A
so yeah that that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us	3142	A
yeah	3142	A
yes	3142	A
uh	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
oh absolutely	3142	A
and do the dishes	3142	A
oh yes	3142	A
oh my- my- my sister who also lives here in Dallas uh tends to uh chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty	3142	A
but	3142	A
what's your favorite restaurant	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
sure	3142	A
you know we've never been there and that's supposed to be wonderful	3142	A
um	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
ooh	3142	A
uh-huh	3142	A
i would probably like that one or two times in my life i've ever had venison i've loved it but you know just it's just not i don't know people who hunt so	3142	A
uh God that's that's supposed to be a wonderful place well- uh uh uh here in Plano	3142	A
well we tend to go to Momo's a lot- fairly often and uh	3142	A
sometimes we'll go you know we we also go to Chili's and uh Colter's Bar B Q and and uh	3142	A
we go to little- there is a little Thai place that's over on park that we go to my husband particularly likes that	3142	A
we go into Dallas a lot and because we're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently and uh we'll go down to uh Blue Mesa Grill for Mexican food and	3142	A
oh	3142	A
okay well i guess i enjoy eating out um uh here and there or	3142	B
it's it's a good change and good change from cooking and eating at home and i guess i like a variety of a variety of restaurants	3142	B
uh sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and	3142	B
and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal and sometimes	3142	B
it's i enjoy going out having a formal meal	3142	B
and uh	3142	B
sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad	3142	B
something you know	3142	B
well a variety i i like to go sometimes without them and sometimes i sometimes it's okay to take them along so sometimes i think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches so uh	3142	B
it just you know it just varies we do a mix sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet -without little ones at the table	3142	B
so uh	3142	B
i guess i guess actually on those those times uh we even there are times i even say oh please don't sit us next to a table with other children	3142	B
this is our night out so	3142	B
but uh anyway where do you like to eat	3142	B
uh-huh	3142	B
right	3142	B
right	3142	B
oh which one do you like	3142	B
oh okay well it's been a long time since we've been in there but uh but it's good there's an Italian restaurant over over by the mall over by uh Plano Parkway there past- oh is it Campari's or something	3142	B
well it's good i haven't my husband had been in there several times and we went in there actually we went in there for lunch one day and uh their pastas were great	3142	B
you're brave	3142	B
oh God	3142	B
right	3142	B
oh well even though traditional it can backfire	3142	B
uh	3142	B
well my husband's kind of the ethnic- he he's the ethnic fan so he's i don't know you know what we read we read the uh D magazine	3142	B
we we check that and uh the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there they often do ratings of restaurants so uh we've	3142	B
uh we've usually we often save those and adventured out on from there	3142	B
uh just for something that had a high rating	3142	B
okay	3142	B
that's	3142	B
that's right	3142	B
oh good oh good	3142	B
oh oh yeah we i guess we we use the coupons too that's true that's true	3142	B
oh right right	3142	B
right	3142	B
well i think that it's just that's exactly- sometimes i think going out to eat it's it's sort of a recreation	3142	B
so uh just a just a change of pace	3142	B
from uh	3142	B
eating at home so uh anyway i guess uh as far as as far as service when we go out gosh it's nice it's nice to have somebody come and wait the table and clear the table and	3142	B
yeah and do the dishes and uh actually it's kind of nice to you know i always uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive	3142	B
so uh we've had experience with that too so	3142	B
oh yeah	3142	B
gosh i guess just in Plano i Plano i like to go to Souper Salads	3142	B
uh Chili's Chili's is always fine	3142	B
i guess if we go to Dallas into Dallas we like uh	3142	B
the Routh is it Routh Street Cafe	3142	B
we	3142	B
well you would like it you'd like it especially it you're adventuresome	3142	B
it just we've we've taken people there several times and uh they have a good they have a good choice of of things that are very different sounding i guess it's whether you call it Southwestern	3142	B
but uh oh we had venison	3142	B
venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful	3142	B
and then i guess it must be seasonal and we've been back oh i guess it's in the winter season well they've never had it when we've been back so but uh well you ought to try that it's it's it's very good	3142	B
no	3142	B
oh that's good yes i've been there	3142	B
yeah i do	3136	A
oh really	3136	A
did you plant those yourself	3136	A
oh	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
oh	3136	A
that's nice oh i love blackberries and we we- uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i	3136	A
but i don't have any down here	3136	A
oh i think i know what they i can't remember what the name of them is- are- are either	3136	A
oh	3136	A
down here the grass	3136	A
well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and	3136	A
and i know they must think you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that	3136	A
that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees	3136	A
i know and she's eaten the bushes i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it	3136	A
and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad	3136	A
so i can't do anything back there because_1 she just she destroys it	3136	A
but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came	3136	A
i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i put- put out front and it killed those too so uh i'm i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything	3136	A
i yeah that that happened to us we have these	3136	A
i know	3136	A
oh i know ours don't	3136	A
i know we can't either but i've got pretty- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard	3136	A
and- and they're big and they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath	3136	A
where the leaves are shading the tree but	3136	A
toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's just it's a never ending cycle	3136	A
yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
huh	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
really and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front	3136	A
and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch	3136	A
so there's not really much i can do about that	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
i do too that's why i look at my neighbors yard i don't have anything to look at so i look at theirs	3136	A
uh-huh	3136	A
yeah	3136	A
yeah it it's really a pain my husband works a lot so um a lot	3136	A
yeah i'm it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and	3136	A
and i just i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard	3136	A
yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself	3136	A
whether he likes it or not	3136	A
oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him	3136	A
that's why i'm help having him help me now	3136	A
okay i i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes i don't know how long you've been here	3136	B
but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we don't have any	3136	B
but we do have some blackberry bushes and and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them	3136	B
um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the kids- i had to the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries	3136	B
but uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot	3136	B
and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them and they're okay	3136	B
yeah um	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah uh we have some flowers that have they just are real hearty also and they're bulbs and they come up every year	3136	B
but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out	3136	B
and uh	3136	B
there a i don't know what kind of flowers they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of uh	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
no but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain	3136	B
and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um do that now as far as our grass it grows	3136	B
crazy it just keeps growing and growing	3136	B
and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it but it just is	3136	B
i don't i don't know i've lived in Utah my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green i don't know yeah	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
crappy i know we have that too	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
oh dear	3136	B
no uh-huh	3136	B
had somehow gotten in yeah yeah	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
the the other problem that we have well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived	3136	B
uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too	3136	B
they had no right to live but anyway	3136	B
uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them you know we just can't grow uh grass underneath there	3136	B
um-hum	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
right	3136	B
it's a vicious cycle isn't it it's really	3136	B
well i don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up um	3136	B
you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live	3136	B
and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the	3136	B
i think that's pretty much what we have decided now i have two long windows and i'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that	3136	B
so people can't see and hear too much it just	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
that's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um	3136	B
an office that my husband and i work in	3136	B
and so i i really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and that's where the front room is	3136	B
so that's not too bad but i like to look at the flowers they're pretty	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
but it's funny because_1 uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows	3136	B
everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and	3136	B
it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
i know it is it's not my favorite thing in the world either i'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now	3136	B
uh-huh	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
yeah well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so	3136	B
yeah	3136	B
right exactly exactly	3136	B
uh what is- what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money	3195	A
oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it	3195	A
well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i- i manage	3195	A
no do you actually follow a budget	3195	A
well that's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown	3195	A
and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to	3195	A
and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses	3195	A
are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently	3195	A
and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to	3195	A
so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead	3195	A
and we do not buy used- ah new cars uh do you get into the car	3195	A
we do for us very much so in fact we	3195	A
are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said	3195	A
look you guys are all into car payments we haven't had car payments for so many years i love it this way	3195	A
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked	3195	A
and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it	3195	A
believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is it's the same color	3195	A
and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the same and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again	3195	A
i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five	3195	A
and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on	3195	A
this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably	3195	A
generally from dealers and uh it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual	3195	A
uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one	3195	A
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying	3195	A
don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us	3195	A
and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes	3195	A
well i we talk about it but i'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh	3195	B
um yes yeah	3195	B
i don't mind the spending it's just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so	3195	B
i see well i'm i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh	3195	B
well we pretty well do um several years we didn't and we found that we just weren't making the most of of what we had	3195	B
and so we we um set aside a certain amount each week that goes for	3195	B
things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then	3195	B
what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
right	3195	B
right	3195	B
uh-huh	3195	B
right	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
right	3195	B
well we had new cars um always until about four years ago my husband um owned his own company and it went under and so	3195	B
we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now it's just seems	3195	B
just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car um do you think that it's wiser to buy used	3195	B
right	3195	B
uh-huh	3195	B
oh no	3195	B
oh wow	3195	B
that's right	3195	B
wow	3195	B
right	3195	B
do you um buy from dealers or from individuals	3195	B
um-hum	3195	B
right	3195	B
right	3195	B
yeah	3195	B
well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement	3121	B
uh in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time	3121	B
and so i was very much a part of all the uh you know what was going on there uh	3121	B
my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now we've seen you know uh black people have a lot more civil rights	3121	B
in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago	3121	B
there's still a lot to be you know to be accomplished but	3121	B
for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
yeah	3121	B
well that's true	3121	B
that's a good one right there	3121	B
right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family	3121	B
and so we were always at family in different people- family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that	3121	B
well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules are so busy	3121	B
mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work	3121	B
and so that means you know a lot of a lot of the social visiting and all was i think probably instigated by women at that time right and now	3121	B
that's right and now uh i mean my mother does not work and and she you know she's finds- finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women	3121	B
but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore	3121	B
there's a real	3121	B
right you know you don't want to you want to make sure it's okay or i guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever	3121	B
well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles	3121	B
and that- and most live within ten or or twenty so but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and	3121	B
most people didn't go away i'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state	3121	B
yeah there is in that area	3121	B
um-hum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social change- i use social change probably the job market has always- and the the economy has always affected uh social change	3121	B
probably	3121	B
well i think just also you know	3121	B
the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change uh people marry	3121	B
yeah people marry later	3121	B
i mean basically i think now again where i'm from in in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school	3121	B
but now out here in Texas where i am now that's very unusual	3121	B
most people get married- i mean get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to	3121	B
be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up	3121	B
right but probably uh you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change because it affects child care and uh	3121	B
but	3121	B
right	3121	B
well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties	3121	B
they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
where do they live	3121	B
well they're not too far though	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
well i live like fourteen hours from home in fact i'm	3121	B
i'm driving tomorrow- i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July	3121	B
no i can drive it all it's just me so i can make it i'm thirty five	3121	B
although it's it's it is pretty i don't know i don't enjoy it that much it's pretty much like get there and	3121	B
it's just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just don't like to drive that far	3121	B
uh-huh	3121	B
when you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it	3121	B
oh	3121	B
uh do you want to give a start on it	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-hum	3121	A
oh definitely	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
you can relate to that now see we didn't we don't have any of that because well like we live in the country	3121	A
in Clarion County and uh	3121	A
we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into	3121	A
so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh	3121	A
uh visiting habits of families and such uh uh	3121	A
yeah that there's less visiting done i think on a whole than there used to be used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not you went visiting	3121	A
and uh today you know people they do visit but it's not quite the same as uh what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
right	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
right right	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
the majority yeah uh-huh	3121	A
probably because when you work	3121	A
you don't really care to go out and visit as much	3121	A
and uh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
no huh-uh they don't do as much	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
you have to make arrangements or have an invitation or	3121	A
yeah yeah	3121	A
well that could be part of it i don't know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so	3121	A
we really don't have that even we don't yeah	3121	A
oh really	3121	A
oh that's pretty good yeah	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
well apparently there must be work available	3121	A
for those that are	3121	A
uh-huh because around here there's really nothing for the young people no good i mean there's jobs there's minimum wage jobs but uh to make a good living there really around here there just isn't too much	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
so well there's the main things i can think of i really	3121	A
tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really	3121	A
that	3121	A
yeah definitely some good and some bad	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
they'd rather get their life started first before uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of	3121	A
effort and concentration and if you're busy with school it's i think it's really difficult for a family	3121	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3121	A
right right	3121	A
yeah i know my my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh she has two little boys and they they've been in day care since you know one's four and one's one	3121	A
and they've done well now i wouldn't want to do it that way but uh she's quite happy and the children seem quite adjusted	3121	A
and uh	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
uh-huh yes uh-huh	3121	A
that's right yeah	3121	A
uh-huh now i'm going to babysit my granddaughter she's just eight weeks old so this will be new for me	3121	A
so uh	3121	A
but the others i'm too far away to help them out at all	3121	A
uh well i have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh one in Maryland and one in Connecticut a son in Connecticut	3121	A
no but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and uh it's too far to you know really go too often	3121	A
Pittsburgh's not quite so bad it's just a couple hours	3121	A
Maryland maybe five hour drive	3121	A
that's	3121	A
uh-huh that's worse yet	3121	A
oh are you really	3121	A
do you uh stay overnight on the way or you	3121	A
you're young how old are you	3121	A
okay well you're young enough yet to	3121	A
uh-huh	3121	A
it's work to get there yeah yeah huh	3121	A
uh-huh now my son they they flew he rebuilt a Aranca Chief airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it	3121	A
and it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane	3121	A
but they enjoyed in thoroughly	3121	A
so	3121	A
i'm not sure but you have to change phones you have to call from another a different	3121	A
uh i work at TI and we have um of course started drug testing um random drug testing here and um i haven't gotten called yet but um	3174	A
i feel that it's probably pretty- it's pretty good	3174	A
if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs	3174	A
um i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at TI but i think our latest statistic- statistic said something like ninety nine point	3174	A
nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the drug- on on all the testing	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
right	3174	A
right	3174	A
right i at TI if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program and um you know you go through the program and then	3174	A
you're called like six months after you complete the program- program and if you test positive then you're terminated	3174	A
yeah uh-huh	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
um-hum oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people if they're if they're not uh you know fully functional	3174	A
mentally while they're doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to other- another people um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
oh yeah	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
so right	3174	A
right	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
oh yes um-hum	3174	A
that's right	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
you know i think personally i'm for it there's	3174	A
several reason why i- i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it	3174	A
and yes and oh yeah it's very expensive and um um-hum it's not like a normal urinalysis it's very expensive to run them and um	3174	A
i didn't get a raise this year because nobody in our company got a raise	3174	A
but yet their they spend all the money on drug testing and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise so see there you know there's different	3174	A
i don't think that that's that i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem and i know that but then i have other views to it	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
right	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
their- their's might not run a thousand dollars our from what i understanding here at TI they run close to a thousand dollars an employee	3174	A
um-hum	3174	A
uh-huh	3174	A
but no for all the the	3174	A
oh it's	3174	A
do they feel that way	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
well i- i think it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to to the drugs i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it it's uh i don't know i don't really liken it	3174	B
to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think it's a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them_1 or get you off of them_1 because you're	3174	B
i don't know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them_1 into some sort of a	3174	B
program to get them off of drugs i would think that is that how they do it at TI maybe that	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
well	3174	B
you you have people out there that are responsible for certain things and you expect them to do their job and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job um as they might do	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that whatever they're taking at the time and and it would be uh	3174	B
you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the schools so i've you know had a	3174	B
they they talk a lot about drugs there and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools	3174	B
but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs you know and	3174	B
if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart and i don't know how many others are	3174	B
doing that and and i think that's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age and uh	3174	B
i don't know it's just a problem that problem- no one is sure just how to handle i think	3174	B
really it's that high	3174	B
oh	3174	B
i didn't realize it was that expensive	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
um-hum just lucky to have jobs	3174	B
um-hum	3174	B
i just i didn't think it was that expensive because_1 my son was in probably a week and a half period and Sam's and Wal-Mart are are	3174	B
owned by the same people he took one for for uh Wal-Mart for job hiring and then Sam's called him and and he took another one and i you know i don't know why they both	3174	B
made him do that since it was so close together i can see if	3174	B
because you know if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted	3174	B
well maybe they run i don't know you know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health	3174	B
type program that it it it would catch a lot of things i- i just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them	3174	B
okay do you have you ever had to put your children in in child care Mary Dell	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh i see	3135	B
oh well i have uh a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool	3135	B
and uh we've just been real lucky i think anyway to not	3135	B
right like half day programs uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh	3135	B
oh my gosh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
right right yeah	3135	B
uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here	3135	B
you know to your lucky to have an art teacher and if you do you get them once a week or something you know	3135	B
oh is that right i had no idea	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to	3135	B
not going to change anytime soon	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten	3135	B
you know it's like wham culture shock it's just	3135	B
yeah yeah get the computers out and you know well that's hard it's so difficult for them um	3135	B
did you have your children did you say in home in in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home	3135	B
uh-huh so you were able to have somebody come there	3135	B
yeah yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you	3135	B
oh	3135	B
oh my goodness	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
oh	3135	B
oh gosh	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh i have uh a	3135	B
uh-huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the Home Show but they were talking about uh	3135	B
a new uh oh i can't even think of the name of it i was halfway listening while i was painting um it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children	3135	B
and they've now moved it to Washington DC and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there	3135	B
you know so um	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh boy that's great	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
right right	3135	B
yeah	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
gosh it's amazing	3135	B
right right	3135	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3135	B
well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly	3135	B
why the government makes the decisions they do	3135	B
you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
right	3135	B
right right	3135	B
oh that's good	3135	B
that's good to know i got a couple of friends that have have found the uh	3135	B
you know a private- a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they	3135	B
usually you know you'll find a a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time	3135	B
uh-huh	3135	B
oh too transit uh-huh	3135	B
and her surroundings too yeah	3135	B
oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now	3135	A
i worked even when she was a baby	3135	A
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist	3135	A
right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place	3135	A
so it worked well how about you	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
yeah	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong	3135	A
preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas	3135	A
but they were so seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it	3135	A
and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that	3135	A
the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there	3135	A
so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and	3135	A
real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that	3135	A
that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
or pay for it after school our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and	3135	A
you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools	3135	A
rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah	3135	A
well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes	3135	A
yeah yeah put the colors away which is too bad	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house	3135	A
and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so yeah-	3135	A
yeah	3135	A
well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money	3135	A
and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead	3135	A
so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so	3135	A
i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center	3135	A
um-hum	3135	A
um-hum	3135	A
yeah oh that would be hard	3135	A
well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or	3135	A
are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time	3135	A
for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint	3135	A
we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just wean- wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again	3135	A
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but	3135	A
i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast	3135	A
and for our age group it's too late too little too late	3135	A
but i i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
right yeah	3135	A
oh sure	3135	A
you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that	3135	A
well- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces	3135	A
so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
uh-huh	3135	A
well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area	3135	A
and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year	3135	A
and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to	3135	A
and well that's interesting isn't it yeah	3161	B
right	3161	B
what did you think about that idea	3161	B
hm they've not really given it attention either yeah	3161	B
right	3161	B
well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions they uh	3161	B
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because_1 they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing	3161	B
so i i would hate to have that responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address	3161	B
i uh	3161	B
i guess i it it frightens me to think of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer and	3161	B
many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other	3161	B
whether it's through	3161	B
prevention or or treatment or you know	3161	B
just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves	3161	B
so it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it	3161	B
just change our priorities-	3161	B
right just change our priorities a little bit and	3161	B
right	3161	B
the AIDS issue is	3161	A
is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how	3161	A
can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are	3161	A
on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending	3161	A
as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more people- mean more people than AIDS	3161	A
and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer	3161	A
so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh	3161	A
i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that	3161	A
whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh	3161	A
it's just one big PR campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS	3161	A
and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those	3161	A
well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded	3161	A
and uh having thought about that for a while	3161	A
well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i got- i got to thinking	3161	A
the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood antigen- antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood	3161	A
and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years	3161	A
so it's not really cure for- yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major	3161	A
uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it	3161	A
through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever	3161	A
how they fund whatever um illness they wish it's- it's kind of hard to	3161	A
to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or	3161	A
right	3161	A
right	3161	A
that's true	3161	A
you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh	3161	A
i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a	3161	A
a unfair advantage as they were but	3161	A
the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money	3161	A
uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but	3161	A
we have such an affluent -society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's	3161	A
yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but	3161	A
are they that enhancing for the masses- for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh	3161	A
had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else	3161	A
oh well that's we rent a lot of videos too um we saw i have two little babies and we saw one movie recently and that was um The Terminator movie um then which i didn't like after all	3155	B
well i don't either it on all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie he doesn't he maims them	3155	B
so	3155	B
um-hum he he uh i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part in the movie so	3155	B
oh i haven't seen that one yet	3155	B
uh-huh	3155	B
oh	3155	B
yeah well it's	3155	B
with all the commercials uh and everything i haven't that's one we wanna see i i wanna see uh Dances With Wolves but we haven't seen that one yet either on video	3155	B
yeah three that's what i heard too	3155	B
yeah we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it so we saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone Oscar	3155	B
supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy which was an interesting movie but not very funny	3155	B
unfortunately-	3155	B
did she	3155	B
well it was it was an amusing movie it just- i guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to uh at the house watching it with with no one else around so	3155	B
oh	3155	B
um-hum	3155	B
my son just turned two and so The Little Mermaid is now our favorite movie	3155	B
we've Little Mermaid and Peter Pan i think are are his two favorites that we've got	3155	B
so	3155	B
oh i haven't i didn't hear that was coming out	3155	B
well they just had uh The Rescuers movie that was a Disney movie wasn't it i think i heard that was just one was just out he's uh he doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet but he likes to uh	3155	B
to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the movie- in the movie so -that's	3155	B
well i well- tell you ever since- my my kids are just small babies and i tell you we we really want to go a lot and uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it	3155	B
sometimes	3155	B
so	3155	B
um-hum that seems to happen i noticed that Dances With Wolves was playing at the uh Granada Theater	3155	B
and uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie i thought that might be kind of fun to do	3155	B
and of course you need a babysitter for that definitely but uh you know i'd really like to get out to the movies more often course it's so expensive now too	3155	B
that you can't hardly afford it i i don't- know we get discount tickets	3155	B
where my husband works but other than that it just seems like it's so expensive and then the popcorn and everything else you almost can't afford to do it	3155	B
no matter what well we did actually get we went on vacation couple months ago and we got to go see What About Bob	3155	B
that was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray	3155	B
that was fun	3155	B
oh he's a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist and Bob is his patient	3155	B
and Bob follows him on vacation it's kind of	3155	B
um-hum um-hum	3155	B
um-hum	3155	B
yeah that's the one	3155	B
must have left an impression	3155	B
i really haven't seen any movies lately so when the computer picked this one i was a little bit surprised but i think i haven't been to the movie theater here in about oh six months but um	3155	A
you know the last movies that i've seen were probably on video	3155	A
yeah	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah now i haven't- i haven't seen The Terminator movie but and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it i don't particularly care for that sort of stuff	3155	A
yeah right yeah he maims them_1 pretty good doesn't he	3155	A
yeah uh-huh i- i saw uh Sleeping with the Enemy oh um i saw it uh oh couple weeks ago i rented it and um	3155	A
watched it and i was i was pretty disappointed in it because i- i was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense and i was pretty disappointed in it now it's- it's a good movie but i guess uh that they built me up too much	3155	A
for my expectations in it there	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah now i haven't seen it either but uh i've heard that it's real long that it's a good movie but it's long like three hours	3155	A
that's right that's right	3155	A
Oscar	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah i know my daughter saw that and she liked it so yeah	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
uh-huh and of course i get to watch all these movies like Look Who's Talking and Who's Look- Look Who's Talking Too and because_1 i have a ten year old so we we watch a lot of movies	3155	A
around that category you know that she that she can watch	3155	A
yeah we seen The Little Mermaid too	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
um-hum and there's some i think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video um Shipwrecked	3155	A
uh-huh yeah it's fixing to come out on video and boy i can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out but	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
right	3155	A
um-hum well i'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater	3155	A
yeah	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
that's right and then they go to the dollar movies	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
yeah that does sound fun	3155	A
right	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
that's right	3155	A
um-hum	3155	A
uh-huh	3155	A
golly i don't think that i've ever heard of that movie	3155	A
oh that's the that's the one where they burn down the house or something the house explodes	3155	A
oh okay	3155	A
okay yeah another movie that i wanna see if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is um oh i just forgot the title of it um	3155	A
oh it's supposed to be a real scary one	3155	A
um	3155	A
darn well here here's another one that i've seen i saw um	3155	A
i can't remember the title of it either um yeah it really did it's it's uh	3155	A
okay well some of the things i like to do are i like to knit i knit sometimes and i sew	3158	A
and um	3158	A
i like to sew sometimes for my kids i- i sew clothes for them every once in a while and i make quilts so	3158	A
after a while cross stitch i think- i don't know i have to put it away and then i have to bring it back you know and and uh	3158	A
i don't know why that is i don't know if it's looking at the little things- little things every time	3158	A
yeah that might be it that might and yet there's uh	3158	A
oh do you	3158	A
oh	3158	A
oh i bet	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
yeah yeah	3158	A
um i've not really done any too much challenging um stuff i- i can do it with a a needle and thread you know	3158	A
but uh and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good but it's very long	3158	A
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group you're not finishing a quilt in a long time	3158	A
so uh	3158	A
so um i like to just mostly do the tie quilts that's so much easier	3158	A
but uh the other ones are very pretty they're uh we have a quilt on our bed that's uh instead of like yarn	3158	A
they tied um ribbon into it	3158	A
and it's real pretty that's real pretty	3158	A
oh wow	3158	A
uh-huh	3158	A
uh-huh	3158	A
now did you say you could knit	3158	A
oh	3158	A
well i was gonna say because_1	3158	A
because_1 if you could knit you could crochet it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to	3158	A
to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand	3158	A
and then you just use your right hand with the hook	3158	A
and that's not it's really not too difficult you could learn that i'm sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet it's not too difficult	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
isn't that interesting	3158	A
i think that's really interesting	3158	A
huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns	3158	A
that people do	3158	A
and i- i just think that um	3158	A
that's one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty	3158	A
and a lot of people don't do that either	3158	A
you know and so	3158	A
yeah yeah	3158	A
yeah	3158	A
yeah that's true you know and and i always think well i can do this while i watch TV or something you know	3158	A
and um it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else and then it doesn't	3158	A
quite work or	3158	A
yeah and	3158	A
you know i like to sketch i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that	3158	A
and that's nice and everything	3158	A
but you know it's funny i can't i can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing i wish i could and and yet i can't do you know like like uh craft uh on wood	3158	A
i can't do that painting thing and yet	3158	A
yeah me too	3158	A
me too i know a woman who's just wonderful at that and	3158	A
and i look at it and you know you look at those things and you wish so badly that you could do them_1 i guess	3158	A
if you wanted to you could take classes and learn i guess that's the only way i could do it	3158	A
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
oh wow that's the next project that i'd like to learn to do i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery	3158	B
and i'm i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch and was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt	3158	B
it gets boring	3158	B
um-hum um-hum	3158	B
well it just reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think	3158	B
but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from Plano to Dallas	3158	B
so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car	3158	B
i don't know that i could even think about quilting	3158	B
you have to have a pretty good frame don't you to do any kind of quilting work	3158	B
hm	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
oh i bet but it's such a lost art	3158	B
uh-huh yes	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
oh	3158	B
i bet	3158	B
there's so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother she had crocheted a full bedspread it's kind of a hobnail looking thing	3158	B
and when i look at it now she's been dead for a long time i think oh why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that	3158	B
people just don't know how to do	3158	B
no um-hum haven't tried that either	3158	B
i wanna learn to crochet i	3158	B
really	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
yeah yeah	3158	B
uh-huh	3158	B
it's funny when you were talking about sewing i love to do anything by hand with a needle	3158	B
but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine i never learned	3158	B
and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
well it's hard to find the time	3158	B
i- i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or	3158	B
just not sitting down at all	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
well and i'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary and so i find myself putting glasses on to	3158	B
to watch TV and then taking them_1 off to do needlework and i get frustrated doing that so just give it up	3158	B
ooh that does-	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
uh-huh	3158	B
yeah i'm the same way if i see something i can copy it but i certainly can't create i admire people that have that in their minds already	3158	B
um-hum	3158	B
well sometimes even with that yeah- i- i think you have to have some	3158	B
um well i guess first of all i i could have asked that before do you have children	3133	A
no okay because_1 i i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt um what- what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
i just um	3133	A
i guess that's my	3133	A
that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and um	3133	A
i had opportunities in high school	3133	A
to work in some programs um	3133	A
and and i agree with what you said that it's	3133	A
uh it benefits the person doing it so much i don't think they realize and i uh	3133	A
i i think it gives you a better perspective on life and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world and and it would certainly help the country too uh	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
yes	3133	A
yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um	3133	A
my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful and then i wondered if people were unwilling but	3133	A
but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long um	3133	A
but i do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um	3133	A
they do still have opportunities	3133	A
but i i think that's a small uh	3133	A
number	3133	A
that could	3133	A
no um not since um	3133	A
not as much as i remember growing up and that was something	3133	A
uh	3133	A
i think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades	3133	A
but	3133	A
yes	3133	A
yeah where uh where abouts do you live what part of the country	3133	A
oh okay we're in Plano so we're not far apart one of the calls i'd gotten before was uh down to Austin and and i know	3133	A
a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area	3133	A
oh	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
well and maybe um maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if we've lost some of that and it it seems in the last decade or two um	3133	A
that's true maybe that's a way	3133	A
if if young people had to do it um	3133	A
maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things i always	3133	A
thought was a wonderful part of our country um	3133	A
is helping others	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
yeah i think uh	3133	A
i think it does help um even preschoolers you know they're um things even just starting around the home you know little ones can do a little bit to help the family	3133	A
and and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern there's always something no matter how young and then that helps	3133	A
develop that attitude um i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more you know i think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it but	3133	A
i wish ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again	3133	A
yeah	3133	A
and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um	3133	A
sometimes what Richardson and Plano both i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is i mean that's uh	3133	A
gosh i'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas and uh	3133	A
it's i know our church youth group um starts with projects young but they- they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year they've done this for fourteen years now	3133	A
um and it is it's um	3133	A
and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there and um	3133	A
it really every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective and	3133	A
and that's just the two- two weeks during during the summer so if two weeks um could have that kind of effect i would	3133	A
think uh	3133	A
well that's	3133	A
yes	3133	A
well i guess um	3133	A
did you have anything else that	3133	A
okay well i i enjoyed talking with you	3133	A
and i hope you have a good evening thanks bye bye	3133	A
okay	3133	B
no	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
i think it's a good idea i think everybody should should uh	3133	B
put in their time so to speak for the	3133	B
for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves i think it's uh would help everyone- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about	3133	B
did you oh	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
really	3133	B
yeah i think that's probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know they just they were they did things for people	3133	B
you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
yeah that's probably true	3133	B
you know but even- even through those groups- groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
yeah i think that's probably true	3133	B
i think it's probably more true still- still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities	3133	B
well i live in Richardson right now which is just	3133	B
right yeah okay sure	3133	B
yeah	3133	B
gosh i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're right	3133	B
yeah but i grew up in a real small town in Florida	3133	B
i mean a real small town	3133	B
and uh i think it was just	3133	B
of course it was back in the in the fifties and i think it was real prevalent back then i i think people thought more of others than they do now you know	3133	B
as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
yeah i do to i do to	3133	B
i'm not sure that that today's kids would go for it though i think you would have to start younger	3133	B
you know i i don't know how young you'd have to go but i think by the time they're oh early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now at least around here um	3133	B
right	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
uh yeah i would have to start in the families first because_1 if you don't it for your for your own immediate family your sure not going to do it for anybody else	3133	B
uh-huh	3133	B
that's probably true that's probably true	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
oh that's great	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
um-hum	3133	B
well that's that's great i'm glad that there are still some areas that	3133	B
that- that get the youth involved in that sort of thing you know like i said i think it does	3133	B
even- even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes	3133	B
well	3133	B
no i i guess that's about all okay	3133	B
well good talking with you	3133	B
you too okay bye	3133	B
they suggested some sort of a recipe uh for um company for entertaining did you have anything in mind that uh you'd like to share	3167	A
ooh	3167	A
uh-huh	3167	A
ooh that sounds good what	3167	A
um-hum	3167	A
i see	3167	A
one tablespoon of Worcester	3167	A
okay	3167	A
oh that	3167	A
how much chili sauce did you say	3167	A
like eight not eight ounces that would be a lot	3167	A
is it okay this would make a lot right	3167	A
and how much crab meat did you use	3167	A
one	3167	A
one can of flake oh okay have you ever used the uh imitation yet	3167	A
ooh that sounds i've tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation and then i found out i went back to the store and they said it is a fish product	3167	A
so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is you know	3167	A
oh that's a good idea whose was that	3167	A
uh	3167	A
uh Sam's right right	3167	A
oh oh that sounds good because that's great that must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant	3167	A
okay i i've	3167	A
right oh hey that sound	3167	A
right and it's something good to have on hand too it's frozen in the first place right so you can uh it is frozen isn't it	3167	A
and then you can refreeze	3167	A
hey that sounds great that sounds-	3167	A
oh do you and that's my favorite and i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it	3167	A
that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve i- i said i can make it in no time it's trying to think	3167	A
and then we just uh built a new home and i have one of these kitchens that the center of the house and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking which is funny	3167	A
but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months we've lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven	3167	A
with all the everything through ready to serve because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine	3167	A
you're right and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come in you know they'll come in the kitchen and i said	3167	A
out we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for for guests you're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen	3167	A
and it- it it has worked out but at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation	3167	A
oh we even have a better one now we decided that we all meet we have it worked- worked	3167	A
well i uh just had a Christmas Around the World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres and	3167	B
and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy it's uh	3167	B
it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon Worcester sauce	3167	B
and mix it and spread it out onto a plate and	3167	B
uh-huh	3167	B
and then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat	3167	B
mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuit crackers	3167	B
and that always goes over real well and it's real easy	3167	B
it's one of the small bottles	3167	B
i don't think uh it-	3167	B
well it's about eight ounces it it uh-huh	3167	B
yeah it would probably make well it- it doesn't make quite as much as you think but yeah spread out because you you keep the cream cheese kind of thin	3167	B
one tin of the flake uh-huh and drain it real good	3167	B
um-hum	3167	B
yes i have i used it uh last Christmas time uh what did i put it in	3167	B
i think i just served it by itself there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff	3167	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3167	B
right right	3167	B
that's very true very true i had bought a cheesecake uh and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be refrozen which i felt was real nice	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
it uh was uh Lawry's i believe or Lawler's and i got it do you have a Sam's wholesale warehouse up there it's real	3167	B
yeah okay that's where i picked it up and it comes out of Chicago and they're very good cheesecakes	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
yes yes and they have and they have the little papers between them_1	3167	B
and i think they're what about nine dollars and something	3167	B
yes yes yes	3167	B
yes it is frozen and i thaw it and then you -can refreeze it and uh-huh it was they're very good very good and that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts	3167	B
is it	3167	B
uh-huh it is	3167	B
uh-huh	3167	B
that's right and your mess	3167	B
yeah	3167	B
yeah- right right	3167	B
that's that's right	3167	B
correct	3167	B
sounds	3167	B
right	3167	B
well a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that we've known a long time like you they uh we all bring things and it sure makes it a whole lot easier anymore	3167	B
well basically uh did you wanna go first then	3184	A
okay right	3184	A
um-hum	3184	A
sure uh-huh	3184	A
yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a small residential area and we're out of the	3184	A
cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and uh it's just a typical um	3184	A
three bedroom type of home it's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know it's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home and um	3184	A
and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um	3184	A
there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's	3184	A
where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of um home so	3184	A
uh	3184	A
uh-huh oh really hm	3184	A
sure	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
yeah	3184	A
oh yeah yeah	3184	A
yeah	3184	A
um-hum so it's a rambler style	3184	A
um-hum	3184	A
yeah yeah it's kind of like what ours is uh our one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because_1 they are making	3184	A
anyway but okay_1 that sounds great and uh i don't know if we need to talk anymore or whatever	3184	A
the TI um yes uh about three times and- so i'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay	3184	A
no huh-uh no i'm out of state i'm in Wisconsin so yeah yeah so its	3184	A
um other than that sure yeah is this your first time	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
i'm the always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because_1 it's like i can get it done with i don't have to wait until somebody called me even though i have a feeling what's gonna happen is i'll probably get tons of calls you know so	3184	A
sooner or later	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
uh-huh	3184	A
yeah yeah yeah sure	3184	A
yes okay well you take it easy Gail um-hum bye now	3184	A
uh well i can i i don't own my home um	3184	B
so i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we aren't sure we're gonna buy a house yet because we don't know if we're gonna be staying here	3184	B
in uh Texas so	3184	B
um-hum	3184	B
um-hum	3184	B
yeah well our home- our house we we're renting it from an individual who bought it and he lives in Korea and- and uh he's recently moved here and he's owns eight or nine properties	3184	B
uh near here and uh so but the houses around here there's five five houses on my street for sale right now	3184	B
which is just uh incredible- -incredible to me and they're not very expensive either it just seems like we we have a three bedroom house ours is one level only um but we	3184	B
yeah we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen and the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger so	3184	B
yeah	3184	B
have you done- have you done this before	3184	B
uh-huh	3184	B
oh have you	3184	B
yeah are you in Texas no yeah	3184	B
oh really oh	3184	B
sounds interesting	3184	B
no huh-uh i've oh i've gotten several calls um but uh	3184	B
yeah	3184	B
yeah yeah well they've i've talked to some people from Cleveland and i did talk to someone else who lives here uh in the same city i do so that was kind of interesting	3184	B
they're they're sure getting their people out so well it was nice to talk to you anyway and okay thanks bye-bye	3184	B
now then i think that are you there all right do you have any one that has been in a nursing home	3191	A
oh	3191	A
yes	3191	A
well what do you think can be done about that i mean what can we do	3191	A
well i can remember of course i'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this	3191	A
we did not have to call on on someone else and i feel	3191	A
yeah	3191	A
certainly did- i worked with an agency in West Texas that	3191	A
they it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels	3191	A
and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen	3191	A
my mother expired just just a little over a year ago and we had finally she didn't wanna live with either my sister or me	3191	A
but we be got found a retirement center for her and it was beautiful and they had all these they didn't even have nursing care there	3191	A
so until as long as mother was you know mobile and got her food- and she was with people with whom she enjoyed	3191	A
sure	3191	A
yes sir	3191	A
yeah	3191	A
being a widow i find that eating alone is one of the hardest things i have to do	3191	A
i have just recently retired and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to	3191	A
so uh mother had the little kitchenette and she could do all these fine things that she just	3191	A
had- had a microwave had to pop her popcorn now this is wonderful but when it came time for a full meal	3191	A
then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy it	3191	A
oh i think so too-	3191	A
well	3191	A
uh-huh yeah i'm here	3191	B
uh well uh we may um my grandmother before very short time um	3191	B
she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip	3191	B
because she could receive more medical attention but um that physical therapy was there and whatever but i think in visiting her there	3191	B
um it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in uh weren't there mentally uh she was probably the only person in the um	3191	B
whole nursing home that uh still had all of her mental facilities about her so that was uh that was very disheartening	3191	B
oh yeah it's really hard i guess i- i come from a family of um	3191	B
of uh take care of your elders i I guess um my my dad's mother is an invalid and she lives with my aunt and uncle and they care for her you know all around the clock though she's not	3191	B
uh she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed	3191	B
so i guess you know there's that family commitment um i know that my parents my mother's trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can	3191	B
um	3191	B
yeah	3191	B
right yeah	3191	B
yeah well probably i think as long as the person's able to um to understand what's going on around them and i think	3191	B
you know my grandmother right now still able to walk around and she's still able to um	3191	B
to do some things for herself though she gets Meals On Wheels which i think is a great thing because um	3191	B
it saves people from having to prepare her food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever though she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her	3191	B
hum-um	3191	B
uh-huh	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
um-hum right	3191	B
yeah that i think you know it's really funny i have two grandmothers still alive and my	3191	B
my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible she's like openly told people she's always been very good about knowing yes she's eighty nine and she said that she really would like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home	3191	B
but when the time comes um	3191	B
she and she can't do things and she has to be cared for or whatever she would prefer and she's actually said this to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment	3191	B
uh probably with like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette	3191	B
so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway	3191	B
uh to a room where there's a cafeteria and there's other people there and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
yes	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
um-hum	3191	B
right	3191	B
yeah i think i think that probably until invalids- until they're really invalids elderly- the elderly are invalids	3191	B
i think that they should be able to interact with other people in- in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it i think um and see i know that	3191	B
my grandmother would like to stay in her house and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma actually says who she wants to live with she's pretty you know she lets people know	3191	B
so-	3191	B
hello my name is Nola i'm in Plano Texas	3140	B
not too far away	3140	B
i've had some from Plano too	3140	B
uh-huh	3140	B
okay um let's see	3140	B
social changes	3140	B
uh sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties i guess	3140	B
think we can handle that	3140	B
okay uh shall i go ahead and push one	3140	B
okay	3140	B
you want to go ahead and start	3140	B
that involves a lot of different areas i think	3140	B
yeah there is a a big difference in the uh economic	3140	B
um status of uh people although i think that has been true uh always um	3140	B
perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was	3140	B
um	3140	B
i think uh	3140	B
my- in my situation i have three children and we're uh home schooling so education you know things that relate to- to education um	3140	B
are things that i think about a lot um i think that and i think that involves	3140	B
social changes a lot	3140	B
uh for instance	3140	B
i think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that	3140	B
are happening socially in the world around them and in in to- because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather	3140	B
more not than are and children being put in day care centers from very early and and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the	3140	B
day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes	3140	B
because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn and they're not um	3140	B
they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have and they don't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and	3140	B
deal with the things in the world	3140	B
and uh i think we're seeing a lot of	3140	B
rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang	3140	B
gang things that are happening and and um	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
yeah oh	3140	B
that's really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and i i think that if they didn't that	3140	B
and- and it became more of the standard not to	3140	B
that uh i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
that's right	3140	B
it's already	3140	B
it already costs society much more because of it you know it trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know	3140	B
um there's and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of two parent	3140	B
um	3140	B
situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know	3140	B
rather than that she has to have the money particularly or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too	3140	B
you know	3140	B
home school	3140	B
yeah	3140	B
no we're i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way	3140	B
yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think	3140	B
home schooling's always been around but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems	3140	B
a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it it's really obvious	3140	B
to look at them and watch the way they act and things that um	3140	B
they've been raised in a day care center	3140	B
well i think it's going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base	3140	B
it's the basic unit	3140	B
and that's the where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better	3140	B
and educating uh you know	3140	B
i know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what	3140	B
family life is like and the uh you know	3140	B
and uh that kind of thing but um	3140	B
hello	3140	A
hi Nola i'm Steve i'm in Dallas Texas	3140	A
no that's unusual seems like usually	3140	A
oh yeah i think all mine have been East Coast people so far	3140	A
so	3140	A
social changes	3140	A
what's that mean	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah i yeah i definitely i mean there's plenty of things to talk about there that's a	3140	A
yeah sure	3140	A
uh i was hoping that you would but oh	3140	A
yeah social changes is that uh	3140	A
it seems to me that uh	3140	A
does uh	3140	A
yeah like a lot it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today	3140	A
so	3140	A
that-	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
it's like people are starting to give up hope and they start out	3140	A
very poor let's see that's a bad tangent to get on what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties	3140	A
and the nineties no	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah it seems so that yeah that is a pretty big change it seems	3140	A
even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like	3140	A
some of these even ladies that that'll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work you know well that that i mean that's very young for a baby	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah i mean they're going to like you said i mean there-	3140	A
there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah- yeah	3140	A
oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment	3140	A
huh is yeah is the thing how uh home study is that what you said home school is that uh is is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or	3140	A
oh is	3140	A
oh well you sound busy	3140	A
so you're teaching them completely huh	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
that's pretty sad because	3140	A
i mean	3140	A
i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
yeah	3140	A
changing people's expectations	3140	A
well not so much personally but my um husband has a aunt who has been like a second mother i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such	3131	A
they live down in College Station where his parents do too and they put her in a home last year she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own	3131	A
so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year	3131	A
uh yeah although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point	3131	A
then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car	3131	A
uh	3131	A
well yeah when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the i mean it wasn't a very um strong stroke it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't quite herself anymore	3131	A
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself and she didn't eat she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it	3131	A
and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so	3131	A
um	3131	A
well she was almost ridiculous like she'd eat ice cream and cookies	3131	A
she'd	3131	A
didn't one	3131	A
oh really well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore oh that's too much trouble that's too much trouble didn't want to cook	3131	A
yeah	3131	A
although they've got uh Meals On Wheels which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat	3131	A
no i don't think there was um i know a little bit more from a a coworker her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in	3131	A
um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but	3131	A
i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House i think out in Arlington something like that	3131	A
and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items	3131	A
they	3131	A
they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half senile-	3131	A
hum	3131	A
so they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items very limited space waste but um at least they all seem to have some	3131	A
you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean	3131	A
very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but	3131	A
yeah i don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else	3131	A
uh-huh	3131	A
uh-huh	3131	A
yeah i have a um my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently and uh she lives in Pennsylvania they live in Alabama and they're saying hey we need you to be closer and	3131	A
you have uh women like that i don't know to men it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that whole i mean they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it	3131	A
um	3131	A
um	3131	A
but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that because i think- i think what do you have there it's a house it's walls and it's furniture but	3131	A
there's nobody there don't you want to be close to me	3131	A
i mean you know be with other people i just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house	3131	A
yeah	3131	A
that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family what does that house got attraction i never really thought of independence	3131	A
uh	3131	A
well when she got home who took care of her	3131	A
ah	3131	A
um-hum	3131	A
um	3131	A
yeah my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and	3131	A
there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here	3131	A
we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
so it was pretty much a physical decision	3131	B
um	3131	B
yeah my husband's family are reaching that point but it's it's so difficult was she in favor of it or or was she	3131	B
kind of opposed to it	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
so often i think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad i work with a lot of elderly people i'm a trust officer	3131	B
and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals	3131	B
yes well you know that's part of the aging process that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste it really is yeah uh-huh	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
and the portions people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals i do that right now and i'm not near nursing home age	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
so as a family you all just	3131	B
visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
oh yeah that's a given	3131	B
um-hum and sometimes the the help there does it i think	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
um-hum	3131	B
adapt yeah	3131	B
i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but	3131	B
the the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better	3131	B
as far as elderly people adapting they're able to move in while they're still independent and still social and and they do group things	3131	B
and then as health or or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and	3131	B
oh i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in it's really kind of difficult	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
well and it's the first step in in actually accepting that you are failing and and aging	3131	B
you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change	3131	B
they they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision	3131	B
and that scares me the the thought of forcing somebody to do something	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
not as independence	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3131	B
yeah and the quality of life really isn't there	3131	B
oh it's tough it really is	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
well they fear being dependent on somebody they they fear being a burden to to family members	3131	B
my husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation	3131	B
she'll let something slip and we'll say wait a minute and and that's it she just well i didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers	3131	B
yeah well she stayed she stayed in a temporary nursing home until she was okay	3131	B
you know it's just but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her she's down in Temple and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on	3131	B
so it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and	3131	B
uh-huh	3131	B
yeah	3131	B
well course my favorite team there is the Texas Rangers so i watch them all the time	3160	A
and who do you watch	3160	A
the Mets	3160	A
this isn't their best season is it	3160	A
well the Rangers are the few games behind Minnesota but if we could win the next oh i guess we'd win have to win most all of them we could still go to the to the race to do the	3160	A
well i watched the two games the last two nights so	3160	A
oh is that right	3160	A
pardon	3160	A
i think they're out six	3160	A
and so they have to still win almost every single game that they have to play to the end now	3160	A
or else	3160	A
yeah yeah	3160	A
i don't know Minnesota's won a good game they're they're doing a good job this year i don't know	3160	A
they really but i'm gonna watch tonight because Nolan Ryan's gonna pitch so i always like to watch him pitch	3160	A
yeah	3160	A
um-hum	3160	A
well uh we just traded Buechele and i really liked him but but- he's gone now so i i guess uh Sierra i like to watch him bat	3160	A
yeah he's he's really good Franco's good except that uh he's got injuries right now his hamstring's down in the bottom of his legs he can't run very well but	3160	A
yeah well they've moved him now since he can't move that quickly since it hurts him	3160	A
they moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into that area in that runs now in between the shortstop area and he takes second base	3160	A
um Sierra let's see yeah Sierra's into	3160	A
is he middle field or left field he's not left field he must be center field	3160	A
do you	3160	A
oh now what's that i don't know what that is	3160	A
oh	3160	A
oh	3160	A
oh	3160	A
yeah that's hard	3160	A
um no not too not too much i- i guess i just don't watch them that much um	3160	A
i like to watch the Oakland A's play they have a lot of good players too but i haven't watched them for a while so i don't know how they're doing too well this season	3160	A
um once every so often mostly Rangers games come on because that's our area but um	3160	A
every once in a while on a Saturday or a Sunday they'll put a another league on you know	3160	A
but it's it just depends	3160	A
how to you know how they fill the time sometimes	3160	A
anyway i um we got	3160	A
what	3160	A
oh is it	3160	A
oh well that's kind of fun	3160	A
yeah uh isn't it's a fun thing i think you'll like it it's a it's a old thing to do and um	3160	A
anyway we just uh if you get run out of things to say then you say good bye it was nice talking to you too	3160	A
and have a good day um bye-bye	3160	A
uh the Mets but i don't do that anymore because uh they're doing lousy i don't know	3160	B
no no	3160	B
i think you're uh definitely an avid fan huh	3160	B
they just i gave up on the Mets around August you know	3160	B
how many games out is Texas	3160	B
how many games out are they	3160	B
right right yeah i think Minnesota's got to get like three wins or or Texas has to lose three games or some combination of that well maybe next year	3160	B
yeah they- they are they are	3160	B
yeah who's who's who he used to be on the Mets a long time ago but who's who's who else is like Texas's big players that that uh	3160	B
right Ruben- right he's supposed to be good	3160	B
he's the shortstop though right Franco	3160	B
right	3160	B
and Sierra's an outfielder	3160	B
yeah i don't see i don't know the American League that well once in a while i watch the Yankees um but rarely and uh but this guy that i'm i work with is in this rotisserie league where they they choose	3160	B
well you choose players and you do stuff based on stats and everything like that so he's always talking to me about the American League	3160	B
like he gets points for every time uh i think he has Ruben Sierra on his team and every time he hits a home run or steals a base or gets a hit he gets a certain amount of points and then you get pitchers and stuff like that	3160	B
so he's always talking about the American League which is like i said because i watch the Mets i don't really know that much about the American League	3160	B
you're not an Astro fan	3160	B
no they're not they they were doing well for a while but then they kind of fell off do you get all the games out there i mean you get you get to watch the A's a lot and stuff like that	3160	B
right	3160	B
right	3160	B
this is my first conversation through this Texas Instruments thing	3160	B
this is the first time i've done one of these conversations yeah	3160	B
so i didn't even expect it i just i happened to have the uh i didn't even know what my um my personal identification number was i just happened to have the folder right in front of me i'm glad i brought it into work just	3160	B
okay well it's nice talking to you and uh be good thank you	3160	B
okay bye-bye	3160	B
do you have any personal feelings on on uh the subject	3105	A
um-hum um-hum	3105	A
so outrageous i know i know	3105	A
right	3105	A
well i i guess my concern is what we're reading especially in Texas right now with them letting out	3105	A
the people out of jail as soon as they're out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out they're back in crime and- and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriffs	3105	A
deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem with that	3105	A
i think so	3105	A
right	3105	A
right	3105	A
well	3105	A
doesn't have the right	3105	A
right	3105	A
right right and meanwhile the witnesses move and die and and- and- and and they and there's no one to face them_1	3105	A
right right well they can't get any if the judge is going to have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it	3105	A
it's it's really bad it uh i	3105	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3105	A
a a time limit too don't let it drag on for fifteen years	3105	A
right	3105	A
right	3105	A
uh do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the result this should be consequences of is capital punishment or or are are there some murders that committed that you think that- leniency should be shown	3105	A
um-hum um-hum	3105	A
okay	3105	A
right	3105	A
um-hum	3105	A
hm and and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are because they have had them they have had them killed when they've	3105	A
um um um	3105	A
oh	3105	A
that was their goal oh	3105	A
that would be premeditated	3105	A
uh	3105	A
they killed him	3105	A
um um um	3105	A
um-hum	3105	A
uh-huh	3105	A
no well that's right there's no reason for murder no- i don't care if you're poor or if you're rich or if you're ugly or if you're prejudice- or uh what there that that's just beyond the	3105	A
i think this giving excuses is pretty prevalent uh uh you- i work in the school district and the all these kids they've they've got an excuse for everything and i can see it continuing on when they're adults	3105	A
i just	3105	A
it's just a a a bad habit uh uh kids have got to learn from the time they're real little there's no excuse for for being bad or making bad choices deliberately or anything it's	3105	A
it's it's uh i- i i sometimes think if if i were on a jury and and had to make the decision could i and i like to think i could if like you if if especially- especially- especially violent	3105	A
crime where it's a serial type killer or where maybe a a child- a child has been deliberately killed or	3105	A
right	3105	A
uh-huh	3105	A
well uh capital punishment's a hard thing but uh there've been several	3105	B
there've been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to	3105	B
to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people	3105	B
there have been some things you know i mean there's things done that are just	3105	B
yeah that i i don't know how	3105	B
i don't really think there's any other way to deal with it	3105	B
yeah i think that that that that's a really	3105	B
yeah if it's a it's a it presents a clear and present danger i mean it	3105	B
but it's something that's really hard to deal with the way that our justice system is right now	3105	B
is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal they're the ones with the rights	3105	B
they have the right to uh you know i think i watched something last week um	3105	B
that evict uh i'm sorry the accused has the right to a speedy trial	3105	B
but the victim does not have the right doesn't have the same	3105	B
doesn't have the same the same uh emphasis on those things as far as they're concerned so now the accused can can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them_1 you know	3105	B
exactly- uh-huh uh-huh exactly a continuance- continuance	3105	B
they can get continuances on for years before a a thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more	3105	B
the	3105	B
yeah that too	3105	B
um	3105	B
i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone	3105	B
has gone through	3105	B
you know a trial- a trial i don't know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there	3105	B
there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been	3105	B
has- uh yeah when someone has- well even when someone has been convicted	3105	B
and i mean	3105	B
it's just so	3105	B
so abundantly clear that they did it	3105	B
that appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times	3105	B
to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that it's such a waste of time and energy and money	3105	B
and it just that's what keeps that's what's keeping all the the you know the the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this	3105	B
oh	3105	B
well i guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that um	3105	B
you know like i could- i could see	3105	B
uh a first time offender being you know maybe in in a in a robbery situation trying to hold up a a store and getting scared and you know firing a gun and accidently	3105	B
killing someone okay i could see that that might be a situation where uh the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and i'm talking about uh	3105	B
cutting people up	3105	B
you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever	3105	B
that those kinds of things and any any kind of violent assault rape included	3105	B
needs to be addressed in in in that context	3105	B
well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty	3105	B
and the thing that was the worst about it is that these	3105	B
that uh two of these individuals were uh well all of the individuals involved were very young	3105	B
one was technically a minor and so he was sent back to Mexico he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here and they had told their teachers that	3105	B
that i mean repeatedly uh during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to to graduate from high school and kill cops	3105	B
that was what they had told their teachers and so that's what they did and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely	3105	B
he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they	3105	B
uh	3105	B
several several things happened that night but they they beat him up and took his gun and shot him	3105	B
with it and it was	3105	B
it was really terrible i mean	3105	B
uh i'd seen him like three or four days before that	3105	B
we'd we've gone out uh	3105	B
with with he and his wife and that was really really disturbing	3105	B
you know that that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobody's that disadvantaged	3105	B
and there's just no reason- i mean	3105	B
no	3105	B
yeah i think so too and that's uh	3105	B
so i i do- i do feel strongly about	3105	B
yeah	3105	B
yeah	3105	B
um-hum	3105	B
the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decisions and still the people nothing ever happens to them	3105	B
you know they stay in jail they get off time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again	3105	B
